Official hygiene partner of the Super Eagles, Dettol, has said that it has thrown its weight behind the Super Eagles, and is in favour of the team taking the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) crown. The brand also promised to ensure the health and hygiene needs of the team are met. In June 2021, Dettol became the official hygiene partner of the Eagles, when it signed a deal with the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF). The partnership is aimed at leveraging Nigerians’ love for football to raise their health consciousness and promote hygienic practices that will become habits. General Manager, Reckitt Sub-Saharan Africa, Akbar Ali Shah said: “Football is a unifier that brings Nigerians from all walks of life together. A vital part of healthy living is good hygiene, and no other brand epitomises this like Dettol. “We’ll provide hygienic protection for the team during their pre and post-match activities during AFCON in Cameroon, powering them on their quest to bring home the 2021 AFCON trophy, and over 200 million Nigerians will be cheering them on.
