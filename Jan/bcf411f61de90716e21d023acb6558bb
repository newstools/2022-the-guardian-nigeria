Tension enveloped parts of Enugu on Tuesday night as heavily armed men reportedly invaded the meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in  Enugu South local government council and shot dead the  State Youth leader of the party, Mr Kelvin Ezeoha, and one other member. Members of the party from ward III Obeagu Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Government Area were having a reconciliation meeting when the armed men numbering over seven stormed the venue killing the two party members. A chieftain of the party in the state confirmed the incident. “Some gunmen invaded the Enugu South LGA APC meeting this evening while their meeting was in progress, opened fire on the party members,” said the party who wanted to remain anonymous. “They killed the immediate past Enugu South local government  Chairman of the party, now  the incumbent state youth leader, Mr Kelvin Ezeoha and one other person, while a party member was kidnapped.” Another source said it was not clear if the killing was  a case of political assassination or handwork of suspected members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) who have reportedly been unleashing terror on innocent citizens of South East in the name of enforcing a sit-at-home order. Efforts to speak with the state police public relations officer, Daniel Ndukwe were unsuccessful, as his mobile phone was switched off.
