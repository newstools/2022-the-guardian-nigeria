Kaduna State Schools Quality Assurance Authority (KSSQA), on Friday, shut down the two Islamiyah schools indefinitely over the alleged rape of a six-year-old girl and impregnation of another 12- year-old girl.
 
Immediately the government received the report of the incident, one of the schools, Madrasatul Ulumul Deeniya wa Tahfizul Qur’an, located in Rigasa, was closed down over the alleged rape of the six-year-old girl in the school premises.  He said that Governor Nasir El-Rufai has ordered that the Islamiyah be shut down indefinitely until the investigation is concluded and the culprit produced.
 
He added that the headmaster of the school would be held responsible for the act until all persons in the school were profiled and the perpetrator identified by the survivor and prosecuted. 
 
“The individuals responsible for the violence against the grandmother, especially the headmaster, will also be prosecuted. This is in line with the state government’s responsibility in protecting the vulnerable population in the state,” he said.  On his part, the DPO confirmed receiving the case and also aligned with the statement of the headteacher of the Islamiyah School.  “Meanwhile, the two schools will remain closed until investigations are concluded and the culprit prosecuted in accordance with the law,” he added.
