That’s just how stressful we find the chore. While we agree that it is herculean, deep down, we know that it’s absolutely necessary. Washing your makeup brushes often puts across a good word about you and your work ethic, but that’s not even the best part. When you wash your brushes, you get rid of old makeup as well as bacteria that may have grown in them. Sometimes, these bacteria are responsible for irritations and acne that clients experience after a makeup session. When you take care of your client’s skin like this, you know you’ll be seeing them a second time. So you see, clean brushes are an investment. Here are a few quick and easy steps to achieve grime-less brushes. Step 1: Buy a makeup removing cleanser It’ll take forever to get all that makeup out with just water. A store-bought makeup brush cleanser is one of the fastest and most effective ways to get rid of makeup at once. These solutions are great for a quick fix, so you should add one to your emergency makeup box. When you have multiple clients in the same hour, spray a few puffs of the solution, wipe it off and you’re good to go. Step 2: Dish soap over detergent When it comes to doing away with makeup, dishwashing liquids are better than any detergent. Detergents often cause makeup brushes to be stiff and brittle and cause more itching when used. Dish soap, on the other hand, has a special formula to fight grease. Dish soaps can dissolve most makeup oils and even melt matte makeup products. For an effective wash, rinse with dish soap at least thrice. Step 3: No dish soap? Use shampoo If you can’t find any dish soap, use detergent, right? Wrong answer. Detergent just doesn’t cut it for makeup brushes. If you can’t get your hands on dish soap, shampoo should be your next option. Shampoos for cleaning makeup brushes are as diverse as can be. A mild baby shampoo will do the trick. If you feel like giving your brushes a treat, you may even use a conditioning shampoo. These make your brushes feel good to the skin. Dry shampoos are also great for when you’re on the go and you don’t want to get your brushes wet. Using a dry shampoo might need some getting used to, but experts admit that it is as efficient as can be. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1643419 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="847" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1-904x598.jpg 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1-320x212.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1-640x424.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/makeup-g0c533837b_1280-1-600x397.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Step 4: Hot water is better Nothing beats warm water and dish soap once a week. To avoid hurting your skin, you should use a rubber glove whenever you use hot water to wash your brushes. Leave your brushes in the water for five to ten minutes, then massage the bristles thoroughly, but gently. Don’t forget to wash the neck and tail of the brush, as makeup residues may pile up there. Step 5: Silicone cleaning pads It may be difficult to get all the makeup out by just rubbing your brush against your palm. Need something more effective? Try a cleaning pad. Silicone cleaning pads have little grooves and projections that give your brush a deep massage. To use these pads, pour your favourite cleaning solution onto the pad. The silicone absorbs the solution. Then, swirl your brush against the raised bumps until the eluting solution is clear and free of makeup. Step 6: DIY cleaning solutions If you haven’t found a makeup brush cleaning solution that hits home, why not try some homemade recipes? Common ingredients to combine in your DIY cleaning solution are apple cider vinegar, baking soda, lemon, lime, and rubbing alcohol. Step 7: Get rid of germs While many dish soaps and shampoos spout disinfectant claims, it is essential to be doubly sure that your brushes are free from bacteria. Note that many disinfectants are not safe for use on the skin, so don’t go dipping your brush in a toilet disinfecting liquid. After thoroughly cleaning your brushes, wipe them once more with rubbing alcohol. Step 8: Makeup brush cleaning machines Save yourself the stress and get a makeup brush cleaning machine to do the work while you do more productive things. The best thing about these machines isn’t just that they get your brushes squeaky clean, it’s that they also dry the brushes. There’s just something so relaxing about dumping your makeup-laden brushes in a machine and coming back to clean, dry brushes, ready to use. Whatever method you choose to use, make sure your brushes are makeup-free and bacteria-free before each use! Remember to be gentle and thorough; it is possible to thoroughly wash your brush without damaging the bristles.
