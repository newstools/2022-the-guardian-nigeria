• Security situation under control, police assure Enforcers of the Mondays’ sit-at-home order of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), yesterday, disrupted activities in Enugu State leading to pandemonium in various parts of the state capital and its environs. IPOB announced the Monday sit-at- home order in August last year to demand the release of its detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu but cancelled the exercise following interventions from some powerful people in South East region over its negative impact on the economy. However, hoodlums seized Enugu State yesterday in the guise of renewing the directive and invaded parts of the state, shooting sporadically in the air and setting some targets on fire. As a result, some cars, tricycles and motorcycles were set ablaze, as there were unconfirmed reports of the death of a policeman and two other persons. The hoodlums arrived the state at 9:00a.m. when most businesses had opened, thereby disrupting vehicular movement at Top land, Amaechi road, Agbani Road, Emene, Gariki and Nowas Transekulu. Banks, businesses and schools that opened for the second term were forced to close down. But the Enugu State Command of the Nigeria Police Force assured residents that security agencies have brought the situation in Enugu under control. It gave the assurance following the sporadic shootings in parts of the state. In a statement issued by the Enugu State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Daniel Ndukwe, the command enjoined law-abiding citizens of the state to go about their lawful businesses without fear of intimidation or harassment. “Police and other security operatives, have been deployed to check activities of the miscreants in the state,” the statement added.
