The National Reconciliation Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has met with leaders of the party in Bayelsa State over lingering leadership crisis. The state chapter of the party has been enmeshed in crisis, including court cases against the newly elected state executive committee members and threats of massive defection to the ruling PDP in the state. It was gathered those who attended the meeting were the party’s governorship standard bearer and a member of the National​ Caretaker and Extraordinary Committee of the party, Chief David Lyon; Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva and some members of the party in the state. It was gathered that the former Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, was absent due to unexplained reasons. Sources at the meeting told our correspondent that the committee was told that there was fear among stakeholders of the polarisation of the congresses and membership of the party. Leaders of the APC group, known as Grassroots Mobiliser Forum of All Progressives Congress led by its Chairman, Elder Idutimi Komonibo, insisted that INEC should be properly communicated on a new date to monitor the review of the ward and local government congresses to give them legal backing.
