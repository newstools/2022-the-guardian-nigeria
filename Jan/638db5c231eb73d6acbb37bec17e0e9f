A teacher, Rasheed Azeez, yesterday, pleaded with Grade A Customary Court in Mapo, Ibadan Oyo State, to dissolve his marriage with Nafisat for allegedly refusing to make love to him in the past three years. Afeez told the court, he has been married to Nafisat for nine years and they have two children, who are eight and five years old. According to him, “my wife has refused to make love to me since September 2019 and I asked her the reason for her action, she told me it is because we are both AS genotype. I am not satisfied with the reason after having two children together,” he told the president of the court, S. M Akintayo. He said, according to their religion, there are some things that are not permitted, but ever since he has been denied, she has started acting strange. “She curses and insults me. Even one night when I was trying to make love to her, she brought out a knife and threatened me and in the process of struggling with her my tooth got broken. “At a time, I thought she was possessed, I prayed for her but still she did not change,” he added. The petitioner said she even opted for family planning without his consent. Azeez, however, appealed to the court to dissolve the marriage. The President of the court, S.M Akintayo adjourned the matter till March 4, for cross-examination.
