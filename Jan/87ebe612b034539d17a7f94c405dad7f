Download logo Mauritius has obtained two “As” by the Human Rights Committee, during the 2021 follow-up processes, for implementing the recommendations pertaining to the treatment of asylum seekers, refugees and stateless person residing in its territory.  Mauritius collected data and published on these groups. The country also provided information on the measures it had taken in regards to juvenile justice, including the training police officers to handle cases relating to juvenile justice. The Human Rights Committee periodically examines reports on the implementation of the legal obligations of countries that have ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. With regard to the above, the Minister of Land Transport and Light Rail, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and International Trade, Mr Alan Ganoo, gave a statement to the Government Information Service, today, in Port-Louis. The achievement, he said, is a matter of pride for the country adding that Mauritius has been commended equally for measures as regards juvenile justice including training of Police Officers to handle cases relating to juvenile justice. The Minister attributed the recognition to the good works undertaken by the National Mechanism for Reporting and Follow-Up which was set up in 2017. It is recalled that Mauritius ratified the ICCPR in December 1973 and submitted its last periodic report in 2016. Jordan, Liechtenstein, the Republic of Moldova and New Zealand have also received top grades in implementing priority recommendations by the Human Rights Committee.
