In this image taken from video released by Kazakhstan s Presidential Press Service, Kazakhstan s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev speaks during his televised statement to the nation in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, Friday, Jan. 7, 2022. AP  Tokayev also thanked the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) military alliance and “especially” Russia for its help in quelling the protests that broke out earlier this week. “The presidents exchanged views on the measures taken to restore order in Kazakhstan,” the Kremlin said. The two leaders agreed to remain in “constant” contact and to hold a CSTO video conference meeting in the coming days, the Kremlin added. Long seen as one of the most stable of the five ex-Soviet republics of Central Asia, Kazakhstan plunged into chaos this week, prompting Tokayev to call in troops from the Moscow-led alliance.
