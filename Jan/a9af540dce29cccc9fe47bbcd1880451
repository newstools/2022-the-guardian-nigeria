The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, has ordered officials of the Nigerian Correctional Service to shoot dead any attempt to attack prison facilities across the country. Aregbesola, who gave the directive while addressing senior officers at the Agodi Custodial Centre of the NCoS during an official inspection tour of the facility, emphasized anyone who attempted to attack correctional facilities should not be alive to tell the story. He said the attacks on the custodial centres are not acceptable and must stop, adding that any attempt must henceforth be resisted with brutal force. “The most important thing is the security impregnability of this facility. This is a red zone, a danger zone. Whoever attempt to breach the facility is already dead. He must not live to tell the story,” the minister said. “Any effort to breach our facility is not acceptable. Don’t shoot to injure but shoot to kill for any reason. This is a total embodiment of the state to guarantee the security of the people.” He assured the officers that the government would do its best in ensuring that their welfare is a top priority as a way of ensuring effective service delivery. “We will do our best on your welfare to ensure effective service. I must commend your work for not recording any case of Covid-19 in your facility. You must be effective in preventing the penetration of this facility. “You must have the capacity to repel viciously any attempt to attack or invade this facility and an attempt must remain an attempt,” he added. Based on the ongoing facility tour, the minister has ordered the demolition of shops and business centres within and around the prison facilities.
