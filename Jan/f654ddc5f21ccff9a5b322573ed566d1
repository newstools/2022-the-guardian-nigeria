The Grammy award-winning singer sold more than 600,000 copies of her sixth studio album 30, with 80% of the sales on CD and vinyl. According to Official Charts Company, Adele’s fourth record had over 600,000 combined chart sales, making it the biggest album of 2021. Almost 450,000 of those units were physical sales, while 53,000 of them were counted as downloads. However, this number falls way below the 800,000 copies 25 sold within the first week> Ed Sheeran’s = comes in next as the second biggest album of 2021, followed by ABBA’s comeback album Voyage and Olivia Rodrigo’s debut album Sour. In December 30 was 2021’s top-selling album in the United States after selling over 500,000 copies in just three days after its release. Between November 19 and November 21, more than 500,000 copies of the album had been sold, beating Taylor Swift’s Evermore. 30 is Adele’s first album in six years, inspired by her divorce from her ex-husband Simon Konecki. The 12-track album opens with Strangers By Nature and closes with Love is a game. Other tracks on the album include I Drink Wine and  Cry Your Heart Out, Woman Like Me, Hold On, and To be Loved. 30 explains the singer’s split from Simon Konecki for her son’s benefit “I just felt like I wanted to explain to him, through this record, when he’s in his twenties or thirties, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness. It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that’s a real wound for me that I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to heal.” “I’ve learned a lot of blistering home truths about myself along the way. I’ve shed many layers but also wrapped myself in new ones,” she wrote on Twitter. “I’ve finally found my feeling again. I’d go as far as to say I’ve never felt more peaceful in my life.”
