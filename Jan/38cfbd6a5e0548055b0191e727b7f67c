Inspenonline Limited has initiated a YouTube programme to educate the public on the benefits of a retirement plan. The Managing Director, Inspenonline, Chuks Udo Okonta, said the firm embarked on the programme to address the dearth of knowledge on retirement in the country and help the public to understand and maximise available opportunities to prepare for life after active service. Having engaged in research to ascertain the quality of content on retirement and observed a huge dearth of local content available to help the public put in place a retirement plan, he said, the informed decision to embark on the project. Chuk explained that the programme, which runs from Monday to Friday every week, provides news, interviews and discussions while addressing concerns raised by the viewing public. “Information is the life wire of business and vital to human development. Therefore, we are poised to exchange necessary information with all stakeholders in the retirement space. As blissful retirement remains the desire of all, the Retirement Matters programme was conceived to provide and promote knowledge required to achieve the quest for a better future after a resourceful active life. “Our programme hinges on interviews, feedback, analysis, reportage and more. Through these avenues, we will derive information and disseminate them to the end-users. The interview section will create opportunities for the regulator and operators to address issues and give updates on events in the sector. It will also create an opportunity for the end-users of retirement products and services to express themselves and make contributions on how the regulator and operators can improve their performances,” he submitted.
