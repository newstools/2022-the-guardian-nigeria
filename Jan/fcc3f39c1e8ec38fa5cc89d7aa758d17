The fractures and frictions in Nigeria’s two major political parties, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are pointers to the stunted growth of the country’s party’s system.
  
Recently, the Director-General of Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, resigned his appointment as the manager of policy, strategy and governance system of state governors elected on the platform of APC.  Unwavering agitation, advocacy
SOME APC faithful has accused the former DG of secretly doing the bidding of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who recently announced his intention to seek the party’s presidential ticket.
  
Lukman had disclosed what transpired between him and Tinubu after his resignation. He stated: “One of the party leaders, who honoured me with an invitation to meet him late on Tuesday, January 17, 2022, was Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He commended me for championing the campaigns to reform the party and expressed shock that some members of Forum were intolerant to criticism.  “With these words, he encouraged me to continue with my campaign, which is what the party needs. He declared his support to all decisions of President Buhari to ensure that APC convention holds in February 2022.”
  
Not minding the attempt to box him in a corner as a Tinubu surrogate, Lukman left a mark fortifying the APC think-tank as a conscientious researcher and advocate for good governance. Having dismissed the opposition PDP as failing to do its job as an opposition party, the former DG constituted himself into an internal opposition or watchdog.  Milestones of vitriol
SOME of the acerbic observations Lukman made, which his employers found distasteful include, call for the review of APC’s manifesto ahead of the general election.
