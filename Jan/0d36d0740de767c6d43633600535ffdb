Former Super Eagles Goalkeeper, Ike Shorunmu, has absolved Maduka Okoye of blame for the goal conceded by Nigeria in the round of 16 match of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations against Carthage Eagles of Tunisia. Shorunmu explained that the defenceline, which could not mark the Tunisian striker properly and give a good cover for Okoye, enabled the opposing striker to release a powerful shot, which was almost parried by the Nigerian keeper. He pointed out that there were difficult situation in the game, which would have made Nigeria concede more than one goal if not for Okoye’s alertness. Shorunmu said the Super Eagles could not excel against Tunisia because some key players in the team stuck to their game pattern, which the Tunisians had already discovered, adding that lack of variations in Nigeria’s game was their undoing. “Nobody should blame Maduka Okoye for the Super Eagles ouster in Cameroun. The shot from the Tunisian striker was strong and fast for him to handle because the Eagles defence line did not shield him well. “Okoye covered  his space well and that was why he had a slight touch on the ball, but his reflexes was not fast enough to stop the ball from going into the net. This can happen to any goalkeeper in the world.” The former Super Eagles’ goalkeepers’ trainer said Sunday was not a good day for the Nigerian team, adding, “Eagles would have been beaten by up to three goals if not for Okoye’s excellent saves. People will not see that because Nigeria lost.”
