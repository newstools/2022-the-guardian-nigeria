Former international, Abdul Sule, is positive that the Super Eagles will win the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title if the Coach Augustine Eguavoen-led team maintains the same standard it displayed against Egypt. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Sule, who said he was in Cameroun to watch Eagles’ first match, said the team he saw against Egypt has been transformed by Eguavoen, adding, “I don’t know if I should say it is a miracle because a lot of things have changed in a short time. The team now plays total football unlike the one we were used to before the AFCON.” Sule said he is not surprised by the change in the Super Eagles’ performance, adding that as a former player of the team and also manager, Eguavoen knows how to get the best out of the players. “With the look of things, I think he can bring the cup to Nigeria. I know they can do it, though we have only played against a big team. I think we have the chance if we continue the way we did against the Egyptians,” he stated.
