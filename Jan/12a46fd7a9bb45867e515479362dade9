Kaduna State Government has directed all public schools in the state to operate only four working days a week, between Monday to Thursday instead of the usual five working days. The directive was contained in a notice for school resumption for the second term of the 2021/2022 academic session by the state commissioner for education, Halima Lawal. The directive to public schools comes five weeks after the state government migrated to a four-day working week for all civil servants. Governor Nasir El-Rufai’s spokesman, Muyiwa Adekeye, said the decision was designed to help boost productivity, improve work-life balance, and enable workers to have more time for their families, for rest, and for agriculture. Lawal explained that the 2021/2022 academic calendar would be adjusted to ensure coverage of the curriculum for the academic session. She also informed all parents, guardians, and the public to note that the state government has approved January 10 as the resumption date for the second term of the 2021/2022 academic session. The commissioner advised parents, guardians, and students to comply with all public health guidelines by adopting all protective measures against COVID-19.
