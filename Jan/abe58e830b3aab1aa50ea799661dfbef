Ahead of the 2023 general polls,  members of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Oyo State on Friday thronged the Government Secretariat, Agodi -Ibadan, on a “thank you visit“ to Gov. Seyi Makinde. An ADC chieftain, Sen. Monsurat Sunmonu, who led other members of the party to the Governor’s Office, said the visit was to show appreciation for the fulfilment of the agreement made to the party during the last general elections. Sunmonu said members were ready to pay back to the governor in 2023 with good deeds in return for the favour done to them. She said: “When we started, we got slots for commissioners, special assistants, chairman, secretary and supervisory councillors. “Forty-two slots for special assistants, eight slots for secretary, 36 for supervisory councillors and 24 for councillors. “We really appreciate Gov. Makinde for the promise kept and we assure him that he will get our full support for his second term,” she promised. In his response, Makinde thanked them for their firm support and assured them that he would continue to run a people-oriented government. The governor said he did not coerce ADC members to defect to the PDP before he gave them what was due to them. He equally assured them that those who have yet to benefit from the government would be reached in a short while. “Let me say that if some are afraid that they have e yet to benefit from this government, and considering the fact that only 17 months are left to round up, all I can say is we can still achieve something significant even with the little time remaining for us,“ he promised.
