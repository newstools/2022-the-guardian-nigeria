The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, said it has not taken any decision on which part of the country it would zone its presidential ticket to, just as it cautioned its members against what it called misleading comments on zoning. The clarification, which was contained in a statement by the national publicity secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, made it clear that the issue of zoning of the presidential ticket will be subjected to serious deliberations by all organs of the party before a decision is taken. Tagged: “We have not zoned our presidential ticket” the opposition party said its attention has been drawn to comments and speculations from certain individuals claiming that it has zoned its presidential ticket to a particular part of the country. It described the rumour as completely misleading, adding that such does not, in any way, represent the position of the Party. The party, which urged Nigerians to “completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled,” stressed, “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphatically and unequivocally states that it has not zoned it presidential ticket to any part of the country.” The PDP described itself as a political party founded on democratic principles, pointing out that every action of the party, including zoning, will be based on extensive consultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues, as well as the various tendencies and interests across the nation, with the main objective of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-existence and development of our nation are reinforced and promoted.
