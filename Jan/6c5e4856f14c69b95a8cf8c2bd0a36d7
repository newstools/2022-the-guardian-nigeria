The Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta has disclosed that the digital revolution has continued to aid youth empowerment in the country. 
   
Dabbatta made this known while delivering the 10th and 11th combined Convocation Lecture of the Fountain University, Osogbo, Osun State.  “It is the reason this objective reality is cited as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Indeed, for over 10 years, ICT has consistently contributed more than 10 per cent of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – the telecom sector alone contributed 12.45 per cent to GDP as at the fourth quarter of 2020,” he said.
  
Given that Nigeria accounts for 82 per cent of Africa’s ICT market and 29 per cent of continental Internet usage and sub-Sahara Africa is the fastest-growing region for ICT adoption, the Federal Government, in its determination to ensure that the nation harness the full benefits of ICT, instituted a broadband vision that will see Nigeria as a society of connected communities of high-speed broadband access and connectivity.
