Local carrier, Air Peace, yesterday deepened flight services on Anambra route with the deployment of Embraer 195-E2 and Boeing 737 aircraft into the new airport. The airline similarly increased flight frequencies on Gombe, Owerri and Ibadan routes in line with its ‘no city left behind’ initiative. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said capacity was deployed to Anambra following the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority’s (NCAA) approval of Boeing737 aircraft services at the Anambra Airport. Olisa said the deployment meant more options for passengers flying the route, “which is reflective of the airline’s resolve to ease the burden of air travel in Nigeria”. He added that flights to Yola and Ibadan would also be operated daily, while Gombe would have five flights a week. “Passengers can now connect Owerri with three daily flights from Lagos and Abuja on the brand new Embraer 195-E2. These additional frequencies will take effect from January 28, 2022”, Olisa said. Air Peace is the first airline to touchdown at the new Anambra Airport on April 30, 2021, and commenced scheduled operations properly on December 7, 2021, with an initial frequency of four flights weekly. The airport has recorded 142 flights with 3,865 passengers landing and taking off after one month of its inauguration. Air Peace leads the industry with 20 domestic routes, six regional routes and two international destinations, operating an increasing modern fleet of 34 aircraft, including five brand new Embraer 195-E2s and four Airbus 320s.
