Download logo The Vaal and Bloemhof Dam sluice gates are to remain open as the outflow of water remains high.  Vaal dam storage capacity currently stands at 111.1%, indicating an increase of 0.6% from a day before, while Bloemhof stands at 111,0%, with a decrease of 1% overnight. The decrease in river flow levels upstream of the dams and predictions of a low likelihood of heavy rains next week have at this stage nullified the need to increase the outflow from Bloemhof Dam. The outflows from both catchments feeding the Vaal-Orange River System and the Integrated Vaal River System have been kept the same. However, the Department of Water and Sanitation’s spokesperson, Sputnik Ratau cautions the public that the outflows from Bloemhof, although unchanged, are still relatively high. “We ask the downstream communities to remain vigilant. “Communities living near the Lower Orange should also keep a watchful eye as flows are forecast to increase significantly starting over the weekend,” Ratau explained.
