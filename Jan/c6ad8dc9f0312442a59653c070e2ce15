The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Cecilia Osipitan, in her new year message, urged the staff to show unrelenting commitment to ensuring they meet targets set for 2022. Osipitan, noted that the challenges faced in 2021 formed part of the aspiration for the new year and appealed to her colleagues not to relent in their quest of making the insurance products the most preferred in the industry. Osipitan announced the result of the half-year appraisal exercise, which according to her, was in tune with the organisation’s resolve to recognise and reward outstanding performance. The details of the appraisal exercise showed that 16 employees were elevated to different cadres while 13 members of staff received their employment confirmations. In her words, Osipitan said the greatest asset is the human capital, which “we have recognised as the key success factor in growth and survival, hence we will keep motivating employees through a continuous reward process.”
