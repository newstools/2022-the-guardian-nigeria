The National Reconciliation Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday, restated its readiness to ensure fair hearing, equity and justice in carrying out its assignment in the state. While on a courtesy visit on Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, at the Government House, Osogbo, the committee led by its chairman and former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, said it would attend to palpable, contentious matters, treat petitions and elicit responses after which a report would be made in line with the directive of the leadership of the party at the national level. “As a matter of tradition and respect, when we go to a state like this, where our party is in power, we owe it a duty to pay a courtesy call on the governor, because here (Government House) is our home, to announce and inform him that we are in his land. That is what brought us here. After this, we intend to see what efforts have been made by those who petitioned. If they are identifiable, we want to meet with them. “After meeting with them, we will come back to our home to meet the governor and our party so that if there is any allegation or accusation from the petition received, and after listening to the petitioners, we will listen to the responses to ensure fair hearing from all the parties involved. Governor Oyetola assured the committee of his administration’s absolute cooperation and support to carry out the exercise, and expressed confidence in its composition and ability to dispense justice and ensure fair play.
