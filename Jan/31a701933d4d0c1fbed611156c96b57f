Bauchi Emirate has suspended the former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara from being Jakadan Bauchi and accused him of sponsoring violence in Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local government areas. The emirate announced Dogara’s suspension in a statement. The Guardian had reported that violence broke out on 30 and 31 of December in the two LGAs following the memorial anniversary of the late Sayawa crusader, Baba Peter Gonto. There was a planned book launch about Gonto but Dogara had warned that the event is put on hold, citing insecurity. Many groups sprung up for and against the anniversary. Many houses and cars were vandalised in Bogoro on 31 of December. Emirs of Bauchi and Dass who were guests at the event were attacked by hoodlums on their way to Bogoro. The monarchs were forced to turn back. “You may recall that on 4th January 2022 we met with you here and expressed our stand on the incidence of Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa of the 30th and 31 December 2021,” Galadima Bauchi, Surv. Ibrahim Saidu Jahun and District Head of Zungur, Shehu Mudi Muhammad said in a statement. “Surely, we condemned the incident, described it as barbaric, provocative, and misleading, and called on the Government to investigate, fish out the perpetrators, and bring them to book. “At the recent Council meeting, we reviewed the case again and expressed our dismay one of the sons of the area, a stakeholder and our traditional titleholder who was mentioned as one misleading the people and perpetrating the incidence More surprisingly he did not sympathise or show any sign of remorse towards what happened to their Royal Highnesses, the Emirs of Bauchi and Dass. “The Emirate Council, therefore, decided to suspend his title of JAKADAN BAUCHI until the determination of the case by the court.”
