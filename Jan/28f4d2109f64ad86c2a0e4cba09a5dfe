Bonang had been in a court battle with podcaster, Rea Gopane for defamation. Rea had alleged in one of his episodes in 2021 that she was responsible for introducing her rumoured ex-boyfriend, the rapper AKA, to cocaine. This allegation came after AKA’s fiancée Anele “Nellie” Tembe’s death. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1654307 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bonang-and-Rea-e1643457800944.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" /> Why is Bonang trending? Ok, it all started here.
She sued him & apparently has won her lawsuit against Rea who made defamatory accusations. Rea is now instructed by the court to pay Bonang R300k in damages.

Besides this, he was instructed by her lawyers to apologise and retract his statement. Soon enough but didn’t pay the money. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1654332 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology-337x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2272" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology-337x598.jpg 337w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology-135x240.jpg 135w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology-270x480.jpg 270w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology-338x600.jpg 338w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Reas-apology.jpg 507w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Instead, what we saw was him, in another video, saying, [JUST IN] Bonang sent Rea a “Good luck Rea Gopane” tweet “Bonang is not as smart as she pretends to be. She has all that energy for me, her business paperwork are not even right” Lawsuit brought back in to life? #MfanaKeMfana Mohale Uncle Vinny Mbule Big Xhosa pic.twitter.com/AoeqssDR9c — YaseB  (@ThisIsColbert) January 18, 2022  Then on Friday, the 18 of January, Bonang wished him “good luck” on Twitter, sparking rumours that the war was far from over. In return, he wrote, “Thanks but I don’t need your good luck. See you soon mom.” We guess it’s safe to say we didn’t see it coming OR did we? Yesterday, the 28 of January, she has announced that she won the case. The end.  Thank you for all your support. pic.twitter.com/0MqNYgEumz — Bonang Matheba  (@Bonang) January 28, 2022  In another tweet, she wrote, “The next 30 years ‘bout to be mad fun for him!”, and yet, in another, “….#RunMeMyMoney!” That’s not all. Bonang retweeted a tweep’s post of a quote by business mogul, Kris Jenner that says, “I don’t care how much money somebody might have — if they have nothing. Some people think, ‘ I don’t have any money and they’re not going to sue me.’ Well, we’ll take payment. We’ll garner those wages for, you know, the next 10 years. I think that don’t think. It’s a foolish thing to do.” Two hours later after stating she won, Rea tweeted: <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1654310 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rea-gopane.png" alt="" width="482" height="246" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rea-gopane.png 482w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rea-gopane-320x163.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px" /> Baby girl  pic.twitter.com/FZ4VWaKJur — Rea Gopane (@reagopane) January 28, 2022  Oh well!
