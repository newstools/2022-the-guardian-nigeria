I don’t think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband, Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again,” he said. In an earlier interview with People, White had opened up on how she felt turning 100. “I’m so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age,” said the veteran actress. “It’s amazing.” She noted that being “born a cockeyed optimist” was the key to her upbeat nature. “I got it from my mom, and that never changed,” she said. “I always find the positive.” Joking on the secret to her long life, White said, “I try to avoid anything green. I think it’s working.”
