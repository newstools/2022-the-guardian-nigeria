The 77-year-old South Korean star, who plays Oh II-nam, also known as Player 001, in the hit Netflix series, beat stars such as Billy Crudup (“The Morning Show”), Kieran Culkin (“Succession”), Mark Duplass (“The Morning Show”) and Brett Goldstein (“Ted Lasso”) to clinch home the award for Best Supporting Actor in Television trophy on Sunday. <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1563647 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lee-Jung-Jae-in-Squid-Game-1062x582.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="582" /> O Yeong-su success was reported at a private ceremony that streamed online with no celebrity presenters and no speeches. The organisers previously declared that this year’s Golden Globes would be scaled-down following the lack of diversity issues in the industry among Hollywood Foreign Press Association membership and other questions of ethics related to financial benefits. “O Yeong-su wins Best Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Series, Limited Series, or Television Movie! While O Yeong-su is a respected stage actor in his native South Korea, his Globe nod is his first-ever nomination in a major awards show,” the Golden Globes published on its website. O’s “Squid Game ” castmate Lee Byung-hun applauded him on Instagram, saying, “Bravo!” O Yeong-su victory marks the first time a Korean TV drama or actor has been nominated and won a Golden Globe. “Squid Game” — created by Hwang Dong-hyuk — is a dystopian series in which contestants in desperate need of money play deadly children’s games to win cash prizes. In October, Netflix confirmed the show was its “biggest-ever series at launch” following its debut on September 17. In light of the drama’s massive success, Hwang and Netflix confirmed that there are talks on a second season but it is yet to be confirmed. While in an interview in September O, on South Korean TV said that his life took a significant turn since he appeared on the show. “I feel like I’m in the air. So I’m trying to calm myself down now so I can restrain myself,” he said, adding: “When I go to cafes or other places, I become self-conscious. Being a famous actor was hard too.”
