strong>Jandor mourns ex-SSG, Adeniran-Ogunsanya Lagos State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC) has criticised last weekend’s attendance of the official defection of the Lagos4Lagos Movement to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the governors elected on the platform, describing them as “unserious.”
 
APC Publicity Secretary, Seye Oladejo, stated yesterday: “It is disheartening that the governors abandoned governance on a working day to receive a ‘political starter’ into their midst even while there are pending issues in their states.”
  
The Guardian had reported that Governors Seyi Makinde (Oyo State), Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu) and Nyesom Wike (Rivers) were among those that welcomed the APC group to the PDP.  MEANWHILE, the movement’s Lead Visioner, Dr. Olajide Adediran (popularly known as Jandor), has described as sad news the death of a former Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Princess Adenrele Adeniran-Ogunsanya. The deceased, who served in the administration of former Governor Babatunde Fashola, died in the early hours of yesterday in Lagos. Stating that she did not die a coward in a statement issued by the group’s Press Secretary, Kazeem Bakare, Jandor added that the motherly role the Ikorodu-born politician played in driving the mission of his movement was invaluable. He noted that she was a great pillar of support and encouragement to him and members of the group, adding: “She stood decidedly by the movement at a time when it was dangerous and unfashionable to associate with us.”
