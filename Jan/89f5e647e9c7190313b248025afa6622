Kingdom Friend of the Needy foundation, a subsidiary of Vessels unto Honour Women ministry, has donated food and household items to indigents in Lagos.
 
The Lagos based foundation said the gesture was to support the less privileged and the needy with a special focus on widows and orphans with the aim of bettering their lives.
