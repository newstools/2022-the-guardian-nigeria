To maintain neutrality ahead of the 2023 Presidential elections, the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), yesterday, warned its members against speaking about or endorsing any aspirant that is not yet a registered party’s flag-bearer. According to the apex Northern socio-cultural group, the members can only endorse any credible aspirant after they must have emerged from the party as candidate. As the race to 2023 general election begins, members would be subjected to questions from outsiders as to which candidate the Forum will endorse for the presidency, ACF explained. In his opening remarks at the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of ACF, the National Chairman, Chief Audu Ogbeh, advised members to always answer, “ACF is not a political party to endorse any candidate” to such questions.
