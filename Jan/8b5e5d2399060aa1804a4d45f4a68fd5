With the 27-year-old singer set to drop the 5-track project in February, anticipation is rife on whether Charlotte would maintain her stellar sound fusion, and witty song writing that colours her discography. However, the singer has promised that the new EP will be a “sonic diet of various genres.” If there is anything to watch with Fenna, it is her seamless creativity and versatility. Hopefully, this Ep will retain her soul-stirring lyricism and soft falsettos. Produced heavily by the music maestro, Misty and Dubfunk, Icy Rain EP already looks like a harvest of sonical gems. Fenna describes the new project as a deeply personal memoir on her pain and experiences. “This is my way of bringing these scars to the surface to try and heal. It’s me hoping that if I can excavate this internal conflict, I would be able to hear my heart over my head. This duality is symbolised in the bilingual nature of the lyrics: my psyche sings the opening statement in English, and my subconscious is firing back in Arabic. “Featuring a subtle pop-based background instrumental, I attempt to capture the harsh bitterness of reality. I also tried to balance the gloom, with some light-hearted acoustics.” The upcoming EP intertwines Arabic and English lyrics to provide a soothing and melancholic sonical experience.
