Moses Simon has been named Man of the Match following Nigeria’s comfortable 3- 1 win against Sudan at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations. Simon scored a goal and bagged an assist in the encounter. The FC Nantes winger was on hand to tee-up Samuel Chukwueze for Nigeria’s opening goal in the third minute of the encounter in the Cameroonian city of Garoua, before going on to grab his first goal of the AFCON a minute into the second half with a deft finish. “I’m happy to win this award, it’s nice to be named the best player on the night,” Simon said after the game “The award is not for me alone, it’s for the entire team. The most important thing is that we won and I’m happy about it.” The 25-year-old also impressed in Nigeria’s 1-0 win against Egypt on Tuesday but was beaten to the Man of the Match award by teammate Kelechi Iheanacho, scorer of Nigeria’s only goal against the Pharaohs.
