As part of celebrations to mark 15 years of existence in Africa and Nigeria, an internet service provider, Opera Mini, is giving out free 150GB of data to 150 Nigerians, who use the platform to engage in different social media activities, including the English Premier League, other league competitions, sports news and various breaking news across the world. Opera disclosed that in 2021, Nigerians saved over 4,915 million from its free data campaigns by using the Opera Mini browser to view their favourite Internet platforms. The company said the new year’s free data offer is to enable more Nigerians to have the opportunity to access the Internet, as the company estimated that the price of mobile data in Sub-Saharan Africa is the most expensive in the world, with an average cost of $6.44  per 1 GB of mobile data when compared  to Western Europe, where the same amount of mobile data cost as low as ($2.47). Speaking on the Opera data offer, Instagram impressionist, Perpetua Chris, said the high cost of data made her switch to the Opera Mini web browser for fast and efficient service. “I am happy about the free data offer. I have been using Opera Mini since my high school days when I downloaded the app to do some research for an assignment. I have never looked back. “I use it for any search I do, particularly when I am coming up with skits for my Instagram.”
