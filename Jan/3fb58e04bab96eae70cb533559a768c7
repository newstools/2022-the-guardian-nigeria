The Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, yesterday, said the Aare Onakakanfo’s office under his leadership will leverage the successes recorded in the last four years to reinvent his accomplishments in the South West. Adams stated this during the thanksgiving service held at the Saviour Ministries Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) in Lagos, as part of the programmes to mark the fourth anniversary of his enthronement, as the Aare onakakanfo of Yoruba land. He also expressed gratitude to God for the opportunity to weather the storm by coping with the demands of the office. The generalissimo, who had also observed a special Jumat services last Friday, stated that he would use the office of the Aare Ona Kakanfo to fulfil all the promises he made during his inauguration in Oyo in 2018. “My installation as the 15th Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land in 2018, no doubt, came with a lot of hope and expectations, especially from the Yoruba, both home and abroad, who saw the demand of the office as an Herculean task.” “From my humble background as an activist, leader of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) and the Global Convener of Oodua Progressives Union (OPU), I knew the burden of leadership and I felt the urge to change our peoples’ thinking, particularly, on the exalted position of the Aare onakakanfo of Yoruba land,” he said. He highlighted his achievements in securing the South West with the idea of the South West security outfit, Operation Amotekun and the South West Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG), his scholarships and initiatives in the education sector, human capacity development and sports development at the grassroots level, among other accomplishements.
