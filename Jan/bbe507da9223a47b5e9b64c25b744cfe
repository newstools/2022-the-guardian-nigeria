Paris Saint-Germain coach Mauricio Pochettino said on Sunday that there would be “no problem” with Kylian Mbappe being affected by speculation over his future.

That’s not a problem.” PSG have for several months been attempting to convince Mbappe to stay, but no agreement has been reached and Real Madrid are favourites to secure his signature. “Like everyone else, we hope he can continue at the club for a long time. It is a decision for both sides,” said Pochettino. “For this year, I hope he will show the performance he had last year, and that the solution will be positive for everyone.” Mbappe has scored 15 goals in 24 appearances in all competitions for PSG this season.
