Download logo President Cyril Ramaphosa commends the Matric Class of 2021 on the success achieved by this cohort of learners, educators and parents.  The 2021 National Senior Certificate pass rate is 76,4%, with 256 000 learners eligible for university entrance. “We applaud the multiple successes and improvements recorded by learners during the second year of challenges presented by COVID-19. “Equally commendable is the support given to learners by educators and parents who made sacrifices of their own and placed the interests of learners ahead of their own concerns. “This is a moment for celebration for learners who have passed and a moment for other learners to return to their desks and make another effort to advance their education and improve their quality of life into the future. “Our Second Chance programme is another route to success.” President Ramaphosa calls on learners to celebrate responsibly and safely within the COVID-19 health protocols.
