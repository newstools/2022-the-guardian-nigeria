Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi has ordered the immediate removal of roadblocks on the state’s highways being mounted by “illegal tax collectors” to allow security operatives do their job. Bello issued the directive on Thursday during a trip to Okene Local Government  Area of the state where he and other motorists experienced gridlock due to the illegal roadblocks. The governor, who alighted from his vehicle while on transit, condemned the activities of illegal tax collectors who mounted such roadblocks, noting that it has continued to frustrate transporters and other road users. He ordered his security aides to supervise the immediate removal of the roadblocks to enable other road users free movement. “The illegal roadblocks have caused so much hardship to road users especially the transporters. “I will not condone such practices in the state. Only legally constituted tax collection agencies backed by relevant statutes would be allowed to carry out their responsibilities,” Bello said. Some of the transport workers who were held at the roadblock said they had spent hours before the arrival of the governor and hailed the action. The commuters also cheered and commended the governor for his concern for ordinary citizens.
