Grammy award-winning sensations Burna Boy and Wizkid have yet again created a monster music masterpiece in the African giant’s new song ‘Ballon D’Or’. Produced by Nigerian British producer P2j, this banging track is inspired by one of the most prestigious trophies given to professional soccer players — Ballon D’Or whose recipient is regarded as the best male football player in the world. Shot in Lagos, the chemistry and fluidity between two of the most successful African artistes on the continent, Burna Boy and Wizkid is a beauty that could only have been captured in film by prolific director, Director K who created magic and raised the artistic bar with these visuals. Revealing legendary welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman who makes a sexy cameo in these visuals, Burna Boy is that artiste who, like a moth to a flame, music is an intrinsic pull. ‘Ballon D’Or’ brims with memorable melodies and beats and the artistes’s impressive technique and delivery. Eternally conscious of not just losing the essence of who he is in the midst of everything, Burna Boy steals our hearts with this video and taken us to the suburbs, while Wizkid sprouts leaves in the second half of the song lending credence to an already perfectly produced song.
