Nigeria maintained its winning streak at the ongoing African Cup of Nations, beating Guinea Bissau 2-0 in their last Group D match of the competition. Goals from Sadiq Umar and Captain William Troost-Ekong gave the three-time champions the 100 per cent scorecard in the group stage. Super Eagles dominated most parts of the first half, but poor shooting and lack of composure in front of goal, Umar being the main culprit, denied them an early lead. Coach Augustine Eguavoen made eight changes to the side that defeated Sudan 3-1 on Saturday, with Kelechi Nwakali, Umar, Tyrone Ebuehi, Semi Ajayi, goalkeeper Francis Uzoho and Chidera Ejuke all starting for the first time. Nigeria’s best chance of the first half came in the 23rd minute when Kelechi Nwakali beat two defenders and tucked an inviting pass to Umar who was through on goal, but the Almeria of Spain striker fluffed his chance. Umar made up for his misses midway into the second half when he converted a Kelechi Iheanacho pass to put Nigeria ahead. It became 2-0 in the 74th minute when Troost-Ekong finished off the rebound from a Moses Simon blinder, which came back off the woodwork. In the other group game, Egypt beat Sudan 1-0 to join Nigeria in the round of 16.
