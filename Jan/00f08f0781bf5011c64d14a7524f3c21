The Super Eagles held a training session at the VSTS-ANNEX, Roumde Adija Stadium, in Garoua, yesterday, starting from approximately 1100 hours, allnigeriasoccer.com reports. As is the norm, the players that started and played the majority of the game against the North Africans took part in a recovery session, while the others that didn’t taste action or came in as late substitutes trained fully. The starters such as William Troost-Ekong, Wilfred Ndidi, Ola Aina and Joe Aribo jogged around the pitch under the guidance of an assistant coach, Joseph Yobo. A piece of cheering news is that CD Leganes central defender, Kenneth Omeruo, was involved in the recovery session, participating in all the exercises without any discomfort, so he may be alright to face Sudan on Saturday. Omeruo had to make way for Semi Ajayi with 11 minutes remaining against Egypt on Tuesday after picking up an injury. Those that did not play a part in the match at all or got a few minutes were being drilled by another assistant manager, Paul Aigbogun, and their session was based on ball work and shooting practice. Meanwhile, Chidozie Awaziem was absent from training yesterday and as of now, the official word is that the central defender did not show up due to ill- health. Awaziem was omitted from the Super Eagles matchday 23 squad against Egypt and wasn’t spotted at the stadium during the game.
