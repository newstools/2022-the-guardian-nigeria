Ghana Can’t Beat Us To World Cup Ticket, Says Iwobi The rivalry between Nigeria and Ghana will once again be rekindled, following the World Cup play-off draw held in Douala, Cameroun yesterday. The pairing will see the two neigbouring African football giants slug it out for a ticket to Qatar 2022 World Cup. The first leg will hold on March 24 in Ghana while Nigeria hosts the return leg on March 29.  Other pairings for the final round of African qualifying draw include Egypt versus Senegal, DR Congo against Morocco, Cameroun taking on Algeria and Mali in a duel against Tunisia. Togolese international, Emmanuel Adebayor, a draw assistant, said, “The draw is beautiful. Ten countries, 10 big countries from the continent, it’s going to be interesting and they have to know one thing: they are going out there to represent the continent. “I’m seeing Nigeria against Ghana. It’s going to be very difficult. There is a lot of Ghanaians in Nigeria. There is a lot of Nigerians in Ghana. It’s going to be a very, very tough game.” According to Senegalese international, El Hadji Diouf, also a draw assistant, “Egypt against Senegal is going to be very difficult. Senegal, of course!” When asked which teams he expected to go through. Diouf said “Senegal, Nigeria are very good teams. I think it will work out very well for us. “I think small details will be very important, concentration. We won’t have much time between games to train and recuperate. They’re going to have to show their talent.” Meanwhile, Super Eagles striker, Alex Iwobi, in his reaction to the draw, said that Ghana Black Stars cannot stop Nigeria, adding that the Ghanaians are good, but they cannot stop the Eagles from picking the ticket. “Whatever Ghana have, we have. I don’t see them beating us to the ticket. Ghana was sent out of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun by a relatively unknown Comoros in their last group match played in Garoau,” he said.
