Announcing the update, Netflix uploaded a short video clip that complied scenes from Emily’s time in Paris, including the words “New Year, New Possibilities.” Produced by Darren Star, the series stars Lily Collins as marketing executive Emily Cooper who travels to Paris to represent her boss Kate Walsh at their newly acquired firm Savoir. In the just-concluded season two of the series, it concludes with Emily calling her former Savoir boss Sylvie (Leroy-Beaulieu) with an answer on whether or not she will be extending her stay in Paris to work at the new marketing firm. “Hi Sylvie, it’s me. I’ve made my decision,” Emily said just before the end credits started. Speaking to People, Collins said she would love another season of the series. “I would love the opportunity to get to do a season 3. I myself don’t know her choice yet. I keep asking,” Collins said. “But whatever choice it is, you know it will be filled with drama, fashion and a lot of fun and romance.” As for if Emily stays in Paris or returns to her hometown Chicago, Collins is ready to step back into Emily’s shoes regardless. “I am down for whatever decision comes my way if we get to do it,” she added.
