In a statement to CNN, Cardi B said, “I’m extremely proud to be from the Bronx, and I have lots of family and friends who live and work there still.” “So, when I heard about the fire and all of the victims, I knew I needed to do something to help,” she said. “I cannot begin to imagine the pain and anguish that the families of the victims are experiencing, but I hope that not having to worry about the costs associated with burying their loved ones will help as they move forward and heal. I send my prayers and condolences to everyone affected by this horrific tragedy.” The Money rapper’s rep revealed that she had partnered with The Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City ensuring that the victims’ families be included in her donation and “that the final wishes for their loved ones were met.” New York Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement, “We are grateful for Cardi B, a real superstar on and off the mic, for granting some critical financial relief to families of the victims.” “The city will be forever thankful to her and also to the grassroots donors and corporate partners who have been able to offer immediate support for our neighbors in need, to reestablish themselves during this difficult time.” The state of New York had earlier announced that it would be granting $2 million to a fund for the victims.
