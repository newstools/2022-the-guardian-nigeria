Gordon’s went all out to make the experience unforgettable. Fun was the order of the day as Lagos social butterflies were pampered with a bouncy castle, cosy on-site masseuse and a lovely Glam Bar complete with henna sessions; with music performances by Klasikal, DJ Niro, DJ Showfz and DJ Vee to cap. Highlight of the party was the Gordon’s bar, mixologists kept delicious G&T cocktails flowing. Although guests were treated to the best of Gordon’s G&T, people made sure to go home with it. With Happyness Party 2021, Gordon’s continued its series of Gordon’s at Sunset experiences for consumers to stop and end enjoy the zest of life.
