Barcelona’s new recruit Ferran Torres and his teammate Pedri have both tested positive for Covid-19, the club announced on Monday in a statement. “Pedri and Ferran Torres have tested positive for Covid-19. The players are in good health and are in isolation at their homes,” said Barca. Torres only signed from Manchester City last week and was presented with his Barca jersey at a press conference at the Camp Nou just hours before the announcement of his positive test.
