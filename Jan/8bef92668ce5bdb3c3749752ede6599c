The Super Eagles of Nigeria are through to the last-16 at the Africa Cup of Nations after a comfortable 3-1 win against Sudan on Saturday in Garoua. Nigeria’s goals were scored by Samuel Chukwueze (3rd minute), Taiwo Awoniyi (45th), and Moses Simon (46th). Walieldin Khidir pulled back what turned out to be a solitary goal for Sudan from the penalty spot in the 70th minute. Nigeria Head Coach Austin Eguavoen did not make any changes to the starting-11 that defeated Egypt on Tuesday and it did not take long for the Super Eagles to break the deadlock, as a long throw from Ola Aina into the Sudanese penalty box was well controlled by Simon before the FC Nantes winger found Chukwueze who placed a low shot past the Sudanese goalkeeper. Although the Super Eagles were in control, Sudan did not come easy in the opening minutes as they forced Nigeria goalkeeper Maduka Okoye to make a fine save in the 14th minute off a shot from Mohamed Al Rashed. But it was Nigeria who grabbed a second through Awoniyi in the 45th minute from a Kelechi Iheanacho free-kick which team captain William Troost-Ekong headed towards the Sudanese goal only for the ball to bounce off a Sudanese defender and onto the head of Awoniyi. It was Awoniyi’s maiden senior goal for Nigeria in his third appearance for the Super Eagles. A minute into the second half, Man-of-the-Match Simon, in what was Nigeria’s 95th AFCON game, grabbed a richly deserved goal, bursting down the left, and deftly controlling the ball before placing it past the Sudanese goalie. Sudan then got a penalty because of shirt-pulling in the box and Khidir converted it with aplomb, sending Okoye the wrong way. But it was only ever going to be a consolation goal as Nigeria dominated possession and made wave upon wave of fast-paced attack right until the end.
