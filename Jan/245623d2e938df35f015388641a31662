Fast-rising Afro Pop singer, Daniel Benson, better known as Buju, has joined the league of Nigerian entertainers taking advantage of the ongoing blockchain innovation to create an enhanced experience of his art. Dubbed HeadsByBuju, the singer’s initiative is a Non-fungible Token (NFT), which is expected to have a collage of features including a community feature where his fans get to experience his art and other offerings intimately in the blooming web innovation known as the metaverse. It was also gathered that the first 1000 people to join the host community on Discord stand a chance to win part of the 20 Buju heads up for grabs. The new initiative has about 3,000 members signed up already. “Is there really a limit to how far we can take it? As an artiste, I am always exploring new ways to tell my story, engage with my community and build new bridges of connection. There is a story behind everything, every melody that I have composed or every picture I have tried to paint,” he said. He also mentioned that fans could learn and explore his metaverse initiative via his @headsbybuju platform on Instagram. Musicians exploring the NFT space have become more popular in recent times, with the likes of MI Abaga, Don Jazzy, among others, already making significant investments in the scene.
