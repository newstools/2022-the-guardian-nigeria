Mr. MIZUUCHI Ryuta, Ambassador of Japan to the Republic of Zambia, handed over Japanese TV Programmes to Mr. Malolela Lusambo, Director General of ZNBC, in the presence of Honourable Chushi Kasanda, Minister of Information and Media, as Guest of Honour.  Since 2008, Japan has been providing various Japanese TV programmes including dramas and educational programmes to Zambia’s leading TV stations through the Japan Foundation’s cooperation scheme. This time, the following three programmes were handed over to ZNBC, accumulating the total number of programmes provided to Zambia to 51. The Embassy of Japan in Zambia hopes that the TV programmes will be viewed and enjoyed by as many Zambians as possible and contribute to deepening understanding of Japan among the Zambian people. Further, the provision of programmes is expected to strengthen the capacity of ZNBC and the role of media at large to offer the public entertainment and enlightenment.
