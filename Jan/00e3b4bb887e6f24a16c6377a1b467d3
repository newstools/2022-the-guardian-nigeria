Super Eagles Interim Coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has said it would be unfair not to give credit to former coach, Gernot Rohr, for the team’s performance at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Eguavoen spoke at the post-match conference shortly after the 2-0 victory against the Wild Dogs of Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday. Rohr was sacked by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) for poor performance just before the commencement of the Africa Cup of Nations. Eguavoen, while responding to questions from journalists, said: “I have been expecting this question. There is no way you won’t give credit to Gernot Rohr for the performance of the Super Eagles in this tournament. He qualified the team, and more than 90 per cent of the players were assembled by him. It is unfortunate things happened that way, but to be sincere, Rohr must be given some credit.” Despite the victory in the last group match against Guinea-Bissau on Wednesday, Eguavoen seems not impressed with the Super Eagles’ attack, especially in finishing off opportunities. He said: “We always create chances, but the problem is finishing them off. That is what we have to keep working on as we go further.”
