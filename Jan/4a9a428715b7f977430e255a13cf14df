Former England youth international Ashleigh Plumptre has been given the go-ahead to switch international allegiance to Nigeria. The Leicester City defender featured had been capped 30 times by England at U15, U19 and U23 levels “We are happy to receive Ashleigh’s official clearance from Fifa,” NFF director of communications Ademola Olajire told BBC Sport Africa. Plumptre has a British mother but qualified to play for Nigeria through the grandparent rule. NFF’s Olajire said Plumptre made her switch to Nigeria more seamless with her dedication. “It was only possible because of her commitment and dedication. She made the federation’s work a lot easier by providing all the requirements in quick time,” Olajire said. Plumptre was in camp with Nigeria’s Super Falcons in July 2021 in Austria and featured in a Super Falcon’s 1-0 win over Slovenian club Olimpija Ljubljana in a friendly. She also visited Nigeria for the first time last November and shared memories of her time with her new teammates on social media.   A post shared by Ashleigh Plumptre (@ashleighhplumptre)  To prove her eligibility to feature for the nine-time African champions, the former LA Galaxy star had to get required documents such as a Nigerian passport and her grandfather’s documents and then officially request clearance from the four home nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) as well from Nigerian internal affairs. “Ashleigh personally approached the English FA directly to get the required international clearance from that end,” Olajire said. “Her professionalism and unflinching desire to play for Nigeria is honestly heart-warming. That big move on her part obviously helped a lot and prevented the long wait for the FA’s response. “She got all the documents in a few months without being forced or persuaded. “We’ve been through this Fifa process with other players in the past and others needed to be reminded. Ashleigh made personal sacrifices to ensure a smooth clearance.”
