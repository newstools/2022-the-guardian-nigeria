President Muhammadu Buhari and a leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress Bola Tinubu are currently meeting in Abuja. Tinubu, an ally of the president, is rumored to be interested in succeeding Buhari next year. The Guardian reported on Monday reported that the former Lagos State governor has already informed Buhari of his intention to run for office in 2023. Details of the meeting were not made available to newsmen at the time of filing the reports, Monday, but it was gathered that it is “just a courtesy encounter.” The parley is coming on the heels of an intra-party disagreement among leaders of the ruling party, a development that is threatening the conduct of APC’s long-awaited National Convention. Tinubu is reportedly a front-runner in the race for the APC’s Presidential ticket, with many interests within and outside the party rooting for his candidacy.
