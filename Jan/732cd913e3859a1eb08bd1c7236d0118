The Board of Trustees of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) had a meeting and warned against what it called, “a proposed illegal inauguration of parallel National Executive Committee (NEC)” today in Abuja. IPMAN Board of Trustees Secretary, Tunji Adeniji, gave the warning on Monday in a statement, following an invitation to the inauguration of NEC members by the Sanusi Abdul-Fari-led group faction. Adeniji said that the BoT chairman led by Abdulkadri Aminu has notified the security agencies of the purported illegal inauguration of NEC by some group of individuals. He said that the current Board of Trustees (BoT) of IPMAN has received information that there are plans by some faction of IPMAN to install another leadership for IPMAN on Jan. 18. He said the move was a flagrant violation of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in Abuja on Dec. 14, 2018. Adeniji said the judgment read by Justice Musa Muhammad in suit No. SC15/2015 recognised Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo and Alhaji Danladi Pasali, as President and Secretary of IPMAN, respectively with other elected executives. He said the tenure of the executive would expire on Dec. 14, 2023. The BoT secretary added that IPMAN had already zoned the next president of the association to the Northwest. “Any attempt to install another set of persons as NEC of IPMAN is null and void because the matter has been settled by the Supreme Court, which is the final arbiter of justice in Nigeria. “The Attorney General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami and the Inspector General of Police, Mr Usman Baba, have already directed that the judgment must be complied with. “We are, therefore, calling on the security agencies to t apprehend those behind the move to forestall breakdown of law and order. It must be noted that IPMAN as an association has only one registered Board of Trustee (BOT) and registered constitution with the corporate affairs commission”.
