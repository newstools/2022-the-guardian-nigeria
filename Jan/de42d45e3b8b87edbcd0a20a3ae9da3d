The Oshodi-Tapa family has denied endorsing anyone to become king of Oshodi, distancing the dynasty from the campaign to install Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya (alias MC Oluomo) as Oba of Oshodi. Flanked by members of the family council at a press briefing, yesterday, Chief Maroof-Deen Oshodi, stated that though there were ongoing efforts to upgrade the stool to one of Oba from its present Baale, “we are not unaware of several strange claims to the throne, including the gambit by Akinsanya to be installed as Oba of Oshodi. We want to publicly distance our family from this campaign.” According to him, the family is confident that the authorities of the Lagos State government or any sub-judicial authority would not take any step that would cause a breach of law and order in Oshodi and beyond, which would raise doubts about the people’s oft-stated belief in the rule of law. His words: “We also want to assure members of the public that we will respond to this and other such efforts, if there is any need to do so, as we had responded to earlier attempts to usurp our heritage – and this is by pursuing legal redress in a peaceful and rational manner as upstanding and law-abiding members of the society. “The judicial process did not fail us in the past and we believe there is sufficient precedence to believe that it will subsist with all possible fervour.” Oshodi provided historical evidence to show that Oshodi land belongs to the family, adding: “it is not a yesterday’s claim, but an established historical fact of more than two centuries.”
