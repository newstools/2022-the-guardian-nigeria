 A wedding guest in white and nude. Photo shacara Remember that one unspoken rule that plagues your mind when you have a wedding to attend and you think of a flirty white dress to impress? -Never wear white to a wedding. The most important thing any guest should focus on, even before choosing the dress’s colour, is not to upstage the bride. According to bridal consultant LauraLee Baird, “Although many traditions are getting reinvented or excluded altogether, a constant is the bride is the only person at her wedding who is allowed to wear white”. While brides have become more adventurous with coloured wedding dresses, wearing white as a guest is still a delicate space especially when it is not a stated colour theme for the day. Although brides and the entire bridal scene is becoming less of a landmine for a white-dressed guest, there are still hits and misses with it. There are still safe ways to pull of white for a wedding without attracting dead stares.
