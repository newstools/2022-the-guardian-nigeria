Business mogul, Alhaji Aminu Dantata, has said that if truly the Nigerian elite want to bequeath a prosperous nation to the youth, they must rise to the challenge of clearing the rot in the country. According to him, the nation is at a critical state of democratic transition, which ought to be fine-tuned in line with present realities. He told the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) led by Professor Ango Abdullahi, who were on condolence visit to Kano over the death of Alhaji Bashir Tofa: “You will agree with me that the presidential system of government has failed the nation; what we need now is parliamentary system, because the one we are operating is too cumbersome and financially disturbing.” For Dantata, decay in the family system, dishonesty, corruption and insecurity also call for urgent attention of the elders from both North and South. He also called on politicians to do away with destructive criticism as obtained in the nation’s politics. “We are going nowhere with the kind of politics we are seing today. We must change the narrative, if we are to salvage the nation’s polity,” he added. On his part, Prof. Abdullahi said they were in Kano to condole with the people and government of the state over the demise of Tofa, Ibrahim Datti Ahmed, Sani Dangote and former Secretary to the State Government, Ado Gwaram. Those on the entourage included the President, Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), Nastura Shariff; Gen. Sale Maina, Hakeem Baba Ahmed, Dr. Sadiq Gombe and Hajiya Najaatu Mohammed. NEF also visited the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero; the Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna; and Alhaji Yahya Hamma.
