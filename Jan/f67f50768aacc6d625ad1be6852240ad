The seventh Mike Omotosho Annual Lecture scheduled for January 14 is set to raise awareness on how Nigeria can explore opportunity provided by a digital economy to deliver economic growth through specific and actionable recommendations by private sector stakeholders. The convener, Dr. Mike Omotosho, said this year’s edition on ‘Digital Economy: Panacea for national growth’, will be virtual, adding that speakers are drawn from Europe, North America and Africa. He said: “If there are doubts about the necessity of digital transformation to socio-economic sustainability, the coronavirus has silenced them by emphasising the importance for countries to ensure fully remote operational capacities for their economies. “Although, the country faces significant political, social and economic hurdles in building its digital economy, yet, as the biggest economy in Africa with one of the largest youth populations in the world, Nigeria is well-positioned to develop a strong, vibrant digital economy.”
