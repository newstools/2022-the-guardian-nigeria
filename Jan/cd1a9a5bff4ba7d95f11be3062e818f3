It’s that time of the year when you don’t have to worry about sweat! That takes a huge problem off the hands of millions of Nigerians, except that now you have to try not to look like an unkempt stray cat. Protecting yourself from harmattan isn’t just about looking presentable. It helps you feel just as presentable as you look and prevents you from falling sick. The key to surviving harmattan is water. As easy as that may sound, drinking water is twice as hard during the dry season because you simply do not feel thirsty. Plus, it appears that all the water you drink goes right into your bladder. Here’s your self-help guide to staying hydrated during harmattan, inside and out while maintaining beauty. Your skin needs all the moisture it can get during this period. Your skincare will be incomplete if you do not drink enough water. It is good for your kidneys and other organs, and it will help you feel energised throughout the day. The goal is 2-3 litres in 24 hours. That’s at least four bottles of water in a day.
