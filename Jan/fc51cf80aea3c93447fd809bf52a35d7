Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has urged political leaders to allow 2022 to usher in a new era of peace and reconciliation among political parties and stakeholders, particularly in the state, and the country as whole. Ganduje also said the new year should rejuvenate internal democracy where political parties are expected to produce credible representatives at various levels who have the capacity and ability to win elections and subsequently build on laudable programmes and policies initiated by past leaders. In his new year message signed by the Commissioner for Information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the governor said a recent event in Kano was likely to bring a new dawn in the political history of the state. “The event, which saw Kano political gladiators emphasising the need for reconciliation has elicited excitement from the people of Kano State who have been yearning for the much-needed peace and conciliation to advance the cause for proper development in the political terrain and the society at large,” he said. Ganduje noted that the spate of insecurity across the country in addition to the ravaging poverty as a result of the economic hardship in the country was begging for concern. He, however, expressed hope that despite the challenges, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has been making frantic efforts towards proper implementation of its policies and programmes targeted at lessening the sufferings of the people.
