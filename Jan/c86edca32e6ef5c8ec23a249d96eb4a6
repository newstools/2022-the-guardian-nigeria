Aliero pledges to help strengthen party in Kebbi Aggrieved All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders in Jigawa State have called for the cancellation of the recently held congresses in the state. The angry faction, in a petition to the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), accused Governor Muhammadu Abubakar of breaching the party’s constitution. Signed by six leaders of the group, including Sani Taura, Hafizu Abubakar, Bala Kazaure, Mutari Garki and Saifullahi Mudasshir, the petition accused the governor of singlehandedly championing the congresses that produced consensus nomination of Aminu Gumel as state chairman, alongside 35 others. The APC stakeholders added that due process and provisions of the APC constitution were strangled on October 16, 2021 in the name of state congress. HOWEVER, former Governor Adamu Aliero has assured APC supporters in Kebbi State that he will help strengthen the ruling party in the state.
While addressing his supporters on Sunday, he explained that he would maintain the status quo, by recognising Bala Kangiwa as the authentic party chairman in the state. He emphasised that Kebbi people know one APC, which is the one led by Kangiwa, who he commended for providing efficient and credible leadership in the state, urging all supporters to give Kangiwa maximum support and cooperation. Receiving a crowd of his supporters at Ahmadu Bello International Airport, Birnin Kebbi, Aliero, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Works/Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, expressed appreciation for the turnout of party loyalists to solidarise with him. Also speaking, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi commended Aliero for selfless service to Kebbi people and for developing the state with his resources, time and leadership acumen.
