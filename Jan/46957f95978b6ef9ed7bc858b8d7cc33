The All Progressives Congress (APC) Elders’ Advisory Council has advised party members in the state to see Adebayo Alao-Akala’s death as enough sacrifice to foster unity and embrace genuine reconciliation towards charting a smooth and hiccup-free path for electoral victory and enthronement of the party in 2023. A former deputy governor during late former governor, Lamidi Adesina’s administration, Chief Iyiola Oladokun, made this known when he led council members to the Ogbomoso residence of Alao-Akala, its late chairman. Other council members, who accompanied Oladokun included Pa Alarape Jolaoso, Prof Taoreed Adedoja, Yeye Oba Yinka Adebayo, Dr Isiaka Kolawole and Engr Idris Adeoye. They described the late Ogbomoso-born politician as a legend, astute political leader, strategist, who brought glamour to governance. Lamenting that Alao-Akala died when he was needed most as a pillar in shaping the political future of Nigeria and Oyo State, they said that being the only surviving former governor in the state APC, he was deep in the drawing board, strategising, before his death, on how APC could reclaim Oyo next year. “At the Elders’ Council, we can attest and bear testimony that Alao-Akala was simple, but never stupid; was generous, but not reckless; was wise, but never crafty; bold, but not arrogant; kind, but not timid; humble, but never diffident! “As the leader of the party, Alao-Akala magnanimously committed his resources, time, intellect and health to reposition a crisis-ridden APC. Unfortunately, he died in the course and in the process of this divinely entrusted historic assignment.”
