• Watford List Dannis Against Tottenham Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is isolated after testing positive for COVID and won’t attend today’s game. Takehiro Tomiyasu, Cedric Soares and Callum Chambers missed the win at Norwich because of positive tests and are likely to remain unavailable. Ainsley Maitland-Niles may return to contention after recovering from COVID. Manchester City could welcome back Kyle Walker, who is back in training after sitting out four matches with an unspecified fitness issue. John Stones and Rodri have been absent for the last two games, leaving their availability in doubt, while it remains to be seen whether Joao Cancelo travels to London. As much as Arsenal have improved, and as good as their home record is – only Manchester City’s is better this season – there is still a huge gulf between these two sides. The difference is not going to be as big as it was when City beat the Gunners 5-0 at Etihad Stadium in August, but taking on the leaders is a heck of an asks for Arsenal’s young side. Arsenal has lost the past nine league meetings – their longest ever losing streak against a particular club. Meanwhile, Watford’s leading scorer, Nigeria’s Emmanuel Dennis, is available to face Tottenham, and throughout January, as he will not play in the Africa Cup of Nations. Dennis is not being released by Watford because the Nigerian federation did not request him for the tournament in time. Tom Cleverley has recovered from a hamstring strain but Kiko Femenia will miss out with a similar issue. Tottenham midfielder Giovani Lo Celso has overcome a calf problem and could play for the first time in eight weeks. Steven Bergwijn, Cristian Romero and Ryan Sessegnon remain sidelined.
