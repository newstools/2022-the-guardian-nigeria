There is fear in Ayamelum Local Council of Anambra State following the discovery of the remains of a middle-aged man Mr, Okoye Tagbo, with his vital organs missing.
 
The Guardian learnt that Tagbo, a farmer, who hails from Umuokpanta, Orenja village in Omor, was said to have gone to his farm close to a disputed farmland near Anaku-Omor boundary to harvest cassava on January 10 and never returned.
  
He was allegedly murdered by yet-to-be identified assailants, and his remains was found in a shallow grave near the scene of the attack with head, heart, hands, feet and genital missing, fuelling speculation that he was murdered by warlords from neighbouring Anaku community.
