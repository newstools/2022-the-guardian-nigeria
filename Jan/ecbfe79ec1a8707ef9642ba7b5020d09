ND Western Limited, an indigenous oil and gas company and its partners, have built a medical diagnostic facility in Ogunu, Warri, Delta State. The medical facility, called DeltaPlus Diagnostics, is a corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative of the Independent Petroleum Producers Group, ND Western and the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited. The ND Western/NPDC/IPPG Laboratory is a well-equipped facility that is designed to provide the most convenient, friendliest COVID-19 and blood testing services to hospitals, health management organisations and individuals in Delta and its neighbouring states. Speaking about the project, the Chief Executive officer of ND Western, Eberechukwu Oji, said DeltaPlus Diagnostics, through its collaborative partnership, engaged the Federal Government to proffer a practical solution to the COVID-19 pandemic by building a fully-equipped molecular diagnostics laboratory in RA Shell Housing Estate Ogunu, Warri. He said: “The diagnostics centre aims to provide reliable testing processes and other critical medical diagnostic services to the medical community, corporations, HMOs, and individuals in Delta State and beyond. “The laboratory is equipped to support the medical research community in the South-South and the neighboring states as well as reduce the need to travel for long distances to access critical diagnostic services such as the facility provides.” The official commissioning of the facility is scheduled for this quarter.
