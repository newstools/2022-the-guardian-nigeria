Sir: The article, ‘‘Mkpuru-miri, death on demand’’ written by Matthew Agboma Ozah which appeared in the opinion page of The Guardian of December 8, 2021 came as a very interesting read. It raises the issue of drug abuse among our youth in the society. However, it is important to note that not only those who use the drug, crystal Methamphetamine are exposed to danger. The hazardous effect to people, animals as well as forest around the production site is another kettle of fish. The waste product from methamphetamine lab is as dangerous as the crystal Methamphetamine itself. Now, the question is where is the waste product disposed? The ground is dug like your normal soak away pit. The wastes are emptied into the pit and covered. All the houses, water and plants about 20 -50 meter radius around the site will be laced with methamphetamine.
  
Recall that majority of Nigerian houses depend on borehole as their source of water. Think about pure water you drink.	 Methamphetamine production site around a pure water producing area means all of us have been indirectly consuming methamphetamine without our knowledge. Food for thought. I will come back with signs and features of meth lab. Thank you. Odili Kenneth.
