Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic’s legal battle to stay in Australia and chase a record 21st Grand Slam opened Monday, but public online access was delayed by a technical glitch, a court spokesman said. “I am now advised the hearing has started. The court is working to rectify the situation. Apologies” said federal court spokesman Bruce Phillips. Forty minutes after the case was scheduled to open, the website providing public access to the hearing was still inaccessible, telling users: “Server Too Busy” or “Temporary disruption”.
