Transactions on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) closed on a downward note yesterday, occasioned by losses in shares of Dangote cement and 17 companies, causing market capitalisation to decline by N280 billion.

Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N280 billion to close at N24.793 trillion. Analysts at Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “With the market being lifted mostly by heavyweight stocks, we expect profit-taking activities to sometimes offset some of these gains, as seen in Dangote Cement today. “We anticipate further mixed activity in tomorrow’s session with a slightly bullish close to end the week, as investors continue to trade cautiously whilst cherry-picking attractive counters across the board.” The market’s negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks which are: Dangote Cement, Ardova, NEM Insurance, May & Baker Nigeria and United Capital.
