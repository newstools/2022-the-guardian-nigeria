The ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon may have exposed the country as the ‘headquarters’ of mosquitoes in the world. From Douala airport, you are welcomed into the city by dozens of mosquitoes. At the restaurant, hotels and motor parks, the situation is the same. It is even worse in Garoua, the venue of Super Eagles matches. The neatness of some of the compounds notwithstanding, mosquitoes are your regular visitors and hosts.
 
My findings here in Garoua have revealed that the weather is favourable for the high level of mosquitoes.
 
The people of Garoua spend more money in erecting high fences around their compounds than the buildings. Though there are some beautiful houses in the Government Reservation Area (GRA), there seem to be few individuals occupying them. As soon as night falls, you hardly see a single soul on the street. The situation is worse in the morning. Even when it is 8.00 a.m., you will only see a few individuals on the streets and sometimes, a few motorcycle riders outside looking for passengers.
 
It may take another decade for the dusty roads inside the GRA to be transformed from their present state.
