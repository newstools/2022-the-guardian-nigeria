The National Orientation Agency (NOA), has called on Nigerians to comply with the Federal Government’s directive to fly the national flag at half-mast from January 12 to 14, 2022, as the country mourns its former Head of the Interim National Government (ING), Chief Ernest Shonekan. Director-General of NOA, Dr. Garba Abari, made this call in a statement issued, yesterday, in Abuja by the agency’s Assistant Director of Press, Paul Odenyi. According to Abari, it is a common practice worldwide for national flags to be flown at half-mast on the passing of a national figure, remembrance days or national catastrophe. He described Shonekan’s death as a huge national loss, given the immense contribution of the statesman at a critical moment in the nation’s history. The DG, therefore, urged all heads of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), the country’s foreign missions, corporate organisations, private citizens and all who fly the national flag to ensure that the ensign in their premises flies at half-mast from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. throughout the duration as directed by the Federal Government, as a mark of respect for the former head of state.
