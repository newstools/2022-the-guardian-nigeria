Over 150 blind lifters drawn from across the country are featuring in the maiden Nigeria Blind Powerlifting/ Bench Press Trials holding at the National Stadium Surulere, Lagos. Event coordinator, Silver Ezeikpe, said the trials are aimed at selecting lifters that would represent the country at the inaugural IBSA Powerlifting/Bench Press World Cup and the second Africa Continental Powerlifting and Bench Press Championships holding from March 22 to 29, 2022 in Alexandria, Egypt. Ezeikpe added that this is a complete departure from the past where people fraudulently packaged themselves to such championships without going through due process. The competition is powered by BINA foundation, which is in charge of all blind sports in the country. According to a director at BINA Foundation, Amobi Chikwendu, the competition will help to reposition the game not only in Nigeria, but also on the West African region. Chikwendu promised that BINA Foundation will make blind powerlifting a household sport in the country, just as it has done for the football, which, he added, is already enjoying international recognition.
