No fewer than five persons have been killed in a fresh crisis between farmers and herdsmen in Imeko-Afon Local Council of Ogun State. Property worth millions of naira were also destroyed in the process, while hordes of persons sustained injuries. In the incident, which happened last Thursday, the people of Aworo Community in Yewa North Local Council chased the herdsmen from their village to Idofa in Imeko, killing three of them and their cows. The Aworo people accused the herdsmen of destroying their farmlands and water sources through the open grazing of cows, a practice that the Ogun State Government had since banned.
 
The Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, Mr. Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the fracas, yesterday, while briefing newsmen, said that those behind it would be apprehended. “We are investigating to ensure that those who carried out that dastardly act is apprehended in order not to cause further crises,” he said, adding, “that the situation is under control now as more policemen have been deployed to the place. The commissioner of police has directed that the area commander should take charge of security situation in the area.” He added: “No arrest has been made yet, but we are on it, and we are sure that those who committed that act will be apprehended,” Oyeyemi said. A community leader, who did not want to be mentioned, told The Guardian that after the Aworo people killed the three herdsmen in Idofa, a reprisal led to the death of two Yoruba, one of whom was burnt. Houses, four maize barns, motorcycles and other valuables were set ablaze by the attackers.
