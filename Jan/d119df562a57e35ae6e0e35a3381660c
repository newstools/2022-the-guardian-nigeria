The Pharaohs of Egypt will fight for a place in the semifinals when they meet their North African foes, The Atlas Lions of Morocco, in today’s Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) first game, which will be played at the Cameroun’s national football team’s home ground, the Stade Omnisport Ahmadou Ahidjo in Yaounde. The Pharaohs booked their spot in the quarter-final after they emerged 5-4 winners over Cote d’Ivoire on penalties in a Round of 16 encounter after the match at ended 0-0 in regulation time on Wednesday. Egypt’s captain Mohamed Salah, who scored the winning penalty against the Ivoiriens, is under immense pressure, as he has only scored once in regulation for Pharaohs in this AFCON and he will be keen to play a key role in helping his country beat Morocco. Morocco had progressed to the quarterfinals after they ran out 2-1 winners over Malawi in the Round of 16 game, which was played on Tuesday. The Atlas Lions will pin their hopes of defeating Egypt on influential right-back, Achraf Hakimi, who has been one of the best players at the 2021 AFCON finals. The Paris Saint Germain (PSG) star has scored in each of his last two games for Morocco and he will be determined to continue his scoring form against Egypt.
