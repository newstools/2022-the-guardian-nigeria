Concerned Citizens of Rivers State, a pressure group, has kicked against zoning the 2023 governorship position to the Ogoni ethnic nationality in 2023. The group argued that giving upland another tenure through the Ogoni would mean upland would be having an unbroken 32 years at the governorship seat without any consideration for the riverine area. Spokesperson for the group, Ken Robinson, noted that Dr. Peter Odili governed the state between 1999 and 2007; Celestine Omehia, 2007; Chibuike Amaechi, between 2007 and 2015; and Nyesom Wike, 2015 till date. He said the analysis showed governors from upland have been at the helm of affairs of the state for 24 years. The group recalled that founding fathers took cognizance of the upland and riverine arrangement as a natural political divide in the state. Robinson said: “The issue of riverine and upland is like Nigeria’s political distinction of North and South that cannot be wished away even with the structural creation of six geopolitical zones. “Consequently, even as we seek to de-emphasise our diversity, it should be noted that this political reality has sustained peace and unity in Rivers State. To ignore it is to perpetuate injustice, increase tension and agitation, and exacerbate distrust and acrimony in the state.” He urged Wike to give consideration to the emergence of a governorship candidate from the riverine Ijaw sections of the state, under the PDP, in the 2023 governorship elections, stating that it would be a valued addition to the robust developmental initiatives of his administration. He appealed to political leaders and stakeholders and the entire people of Rivers State to support a riverine  governor after for justice and fairness.
