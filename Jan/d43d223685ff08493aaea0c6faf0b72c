Comoros national team goalkeeper, Salim Ben Boina, has spoken up about CAF ‘biased’ system during Africa Cup of Nations, calling it outrageous. The Coelacanths became the surprise of the tournament after beating Ghana 3-2 in the final group stage game, and advancing as one of the best third-placed sides, in their AFCON debut. In the Round of 16, they had to face hosts Cameroun, but the game was considered by many to be unfair, as Comoros goalkeeper Ali Ahamada was prevented from participating despite his recovery from COVID-19. Ahmada was preparing to take part in the game, but he was shocked to see that CAF refused his participation, claiming that he needs to wait five days after recovery to rejoin his team. As a result, his teammate, Salim Ben Boina, was furious, stating that the system is biased toward Cameroun: “They should just let Cameroun have their trophies now, this is outrageous.” Ali was replaced by left-back, Chaker Alhadhur, and surprisingly, he made an impressive show, conceding only two goals against Cameroun’s vicious attacks. The game ended in a 2-1 defeat for Comoros, with Cameroun advancing to the quarterfinals to confront Gambia, who knocked out Guinea in the Round of 16.
