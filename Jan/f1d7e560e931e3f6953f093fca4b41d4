According to Page Six, Drake enjoyed a secret relationship with Julia Fox in 2020 right before the COVID-19 pandemic. Drake and Fox kicked off their romance after Drake complimented her via Instagram on her acting in Adam Sandler’s 2019 film, Uncut Gems. While the romance lasted, Drake showered her with gifts including two Birkin bags. “Then she went to [his hometown] Toronto to stay with him,” a source told Page Six. Then the pandemic happened and she had to return home in March as borders were being closed. Fox and Ye’s public romance has received approval from his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian who believes that if Fox’s “relationship with Ye continues to grow and Julia comes around the kids, it’ll make co-parenting easier if everyone gets along.” Drake and Kanye settled their long-standing beef in 2021. With all that has gone down between the rappers, we hope that this doesn’t spark any more wars. Meanwhile, Drake and Fox’s teams declined to comment.
