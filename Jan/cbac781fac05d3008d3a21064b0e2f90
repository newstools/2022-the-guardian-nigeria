• ASCSN begins mobilisation against the move
• Coalition plans another Occupy Nigeria Protests on 10th anniversary
• Ozo-Eson advocates phased removal
• Govt must create enabling environs for youths to excel, Esele The year 2022 is loaded with a lot of expectations, especially the Federal Government’s planned removal of petrol subsidy. With the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) becoming law, necessitating full deregulation of the downstream sector amid other sweeping changes envisaged in the oil and gas sector, the woes of Nigerian workers may come in torrents amid stagnated wage regime.  “Labour has the justification to go on strike of interest and strike of right. We can go on strike to force the hands of government on this matter if we are pushed to the wall,” he said.
   
Okon alleged that the removal of petrol subsidy is an attempt to mobilise resources for the 2023 elections and not about the wellbeing of the people. THE Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) had earlier insisted that workers and masses would not accept any further increase in the pump price of fuel in the name of subsidy removal, urging workers and the citizens to prepare for total war against the fuel price hike. NLC President, Ayuba Wabba, in his New Year message to workers, also named Zamfara, Taraba, Benue, Kogi, Cross Rivers, Abia and Imo states as seven states yet to implement the N30,000 minimum wage that took effect on April 18, 2019. NLC directed the affected states to commence indefinite strikes to force the respective state governments to implement the new wage. In a nine-page statement, NLC said the government is still not relenting in its determination to push through further increases in the pump price of petrol and which, as usual, had been dubbed as “removal of petrol subsidy. “Organised Labour has made its position clear on this matter. We have told the government in very clear terms that Nigerians have suffered enough and will not endure more punishment by way of further petrol and electricity price increases.
 
“Our position in this regard is predicated on four major grounds. First is our concern on the deceit and duplicity associated with the politics of petrol price increase by successive governments. The truth is that the perennial increase by the government of the pump price of petrol is actually a transfer of government failure and inability to effectively govern to the satisfaction of the poor masses of our country. “We are talking of the failure of government to manage Nigeria’s four oil refineries and inability to build new ones more than 30 years after the last petrochemical refinery in Port Harcourt was commissioned; the failure to rein in smuggling; and the failure to determine empirically the quantity of petrol consumed in Nigeria. The shame takes a gory dimension with the fact that Nigeria is the only OPEC country that cannot refine its own crude oil.” ALSO, the People’s Alternative Political Movement (TPAP-M), a coalition of individuals and organisations committed to the emergence and building of a mass workers party, and the Socialist Transformation of Nigeria, has rejected the recent hike in the price of gas and the impending hikes in the price of fuel and electricity tariff, among other things.
 
The coalition stated in a communiqué signed by Comrade Jaye Gaskia and Comrade Omotoye Olorode of the TRAP-M secretariat, that it would organise another Occupy Nigeria Protests on the 10th anniversary of the first one this January. The NLC, late last year, also announced plans to embark on nationwide protests on January 27, 2022, to protest against moves by the Nigerian government to increase fuel prices.  ON his part, the immediate past General Secretary of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Dr Peter Ozo-Eson, who admonished Nigerians to keep hope alive, as they begin another year, said he has fears that are rooted in the insecurity challenges confronting the country.
 
His words: “The greatest thing I have going into the New Year is the survival of the country as an entity given the security challenges we are confronting. It is difficult for people to travel for holiday by road. The economy is held hostage by fear of insecurity. So, going into the New Year, my fear is about how far we can bring these to an end because if we do not, it will continue to threaten the very existence of our nation as a modern entity.”  “Labour has indicated a programme of resisting the move over the years. I think what is important is that beyond protests, the organised labour should find a way to get the government to come to the negotiation table either by using a threat of general strike or other means so that the conditions that have to be fulfilled for the removal of subsidy to happen will be negotiated and agreed upon.  “Weakening of the Naira will continue to increase the price of imported products and it will become a vicious circle. The removal can then be tied to the number of products we are able to refine locally. That will make some sense if it is properly planned.”
