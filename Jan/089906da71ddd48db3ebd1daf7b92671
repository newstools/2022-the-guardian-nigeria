According to Las Vegas police, Derulo “committed a battery against two individuals” in a disagreement at the city’s Aria resort and casino early on Tuesday morning. Video clips reveal Derulo running across the venue’s atrium and throwing punches at an unknown man, who had ridiculed him with comparisons to the R&B singer Usher. Derulo was seen in handcuffs and taken off the premises, with the resort making a trespass order against him. The American pop star has not been arrested or charged over the attack. A police report was not made as the victims chose not to press charges. Derulo has enjoyed continued chart success since his 2009 debut, earning 15 UK Top 10 hits, five of them going to No 1. He has worked together with artists including Jennifer Lopez, Nicki Minaj and Snoop Dogg, and earned a sizeable following for his skits on TikTok, with 51m followers.
