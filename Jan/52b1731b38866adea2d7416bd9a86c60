Rivers United of Port Harcourt have been on fire this season. The club, which represented Nigeria in the 2021 CAF Champions League, have surprised even their most ardent supporters with a superlative performance that have seen them beat the country’s record champions, Enyimba, in Aba. Such performances are what champions are made of and the club’s major sponsor, Eunisell Limited, is thrilled by this impressive start in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) this season. The Port Harcourt club has won five and drew three of their first eight games of the season. The club has also produced the top scorer so far this season in Kayode Rafiu Ishaq, who has scored seven goals in eight matches. Eunisell’s Managing Director, Chika Ikenga, is excited with the unbeaten start of the club and believes that they can go all the way to make fans proud at the end of the season. “The performance of Rivers United at the start of this season is a follow up on their previous display from past seasons. Last season they came close to the title but missed out. This time they have started well and we as their partner are happy about this and are glad to be associated with the club’s success story so far. “Eunisell believes that we can fashion out a partnership with Rivers United and become a winning team and that is why we have stayed with them in the long haul,” said Ikenga. The Eunisell boss urged the club “to keep the rich vein of form running as long as they can.” “As a partner, we can only encourage the club, the players, coaches, officials and others working behind the scene” to keep the rich vein of form running as long as they can,” Ikenga said.
