Nigeria’s U-20 Girls, Falconets, will fly into the city of Douala today ahead of a FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, fourth round, first leg encounter against their Camerounian counterparts. The match will hold on Saturday at the Stade Japoma. This fixture, being the penultimate round of the qualification series, is guaranteed to produce fireworks in both legs, with the eternal rivalry between Nigeria and Cameroun being the strongest undertone in the narrative.
 
Two-time World Cup silver medallists Nigeria joined the qualifying race at the second round, but have already logged a 15-goal haul, including a 4-0 trouncing of hosts Republic of Congo in Brazzaville in the third round that persuaded the Congolese to jettison the plan to fly to Lagos for the return leg.  The team picked for the challenge includes goalkeepers Nelly Ekeh (Sunshine Queens), Monle Oyono (Bayelsa Queens) and Inyene Etim (Abia Angels).
 
The defenders are Oluwatosin Demehin (Rivers Angels), Omowunmi Oshobukola (Edo Queens), Rofiat Imuran (Rivers Angels), Jumoke Alani (Edo Queens); Motunrayo Ezekiel (Naija Ratels), Oluwabunmi Oladeji (Nasarawa Amazons) and Oluchi Ohaegbulem (Confluence Queens), while Bashirat Amoo (Nasarawa Amazons), Esther Onyenezide (FC Robo Queens), Yina Adoo (Nasarawa Amazons), Chidinma Ogbuchi (FC Robo Queens), Chinyere Kalu (Nasarawa Amazons) and Anuoluwapo Salisu (Bayelsa Queens) are the midfielders.
