Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, is expected to tee off the maiden Armed Forces Pro-Am golf tournament in Jaji, the home of the Armed Forces Infantry. The event, which will run from February 1 to 6, will be the first professional golf tournament the Ola Saad Ibrahim Golf Club situated inside the massive complex of the Armed Forces Staff College will host in its five decades of existence. Club Captain, Navy Commander J.O. Shaibu, said El Rufai was specially chosen to perform the ceremonial ‘tee-off’ of the great event because of his extra ordinary synergy with the Armed Forces in ensuring that Kaduna is free from banditry and kidnapping. He disclosed that the event will feature 150 professionals and 350 amateurs from across the country. “The governor has done a lot to ensure that Kaduna is enjoying peace once again,” Shaibu, who is also the commandant of the secondary school inside the Staff College, noted. “The governor is always reaching out to the Armed Forces to ensure that safety prevails in Kaduna State. And the fact that peace has returned is reason over 500 golfers will converge in Jaji for a weeklong golfing activity.” One of the pillars behind the Jaji club, Major General MG Ali, is equally elated that the Ola Saad Golf Club would be welcoming professional golfers for the first time in about 50 years in existence. The club patron, who is also the Commandant of the Nigeria Army School of Infantry, said: “I love the game of golf with passion. We have a great golf course in Jaji here and we have been hosting quality amateur tournaments over the years. “So, when the captain came with the idea that we should host a professional event for the first time, I supported him fully. I can only assure that we shall collectively strive to make this an annual event.”
