This story might be of interest to Nigerians, particularly, those who are exploited on daily basis to pay as high as N50, 400 for the COVID-19 test before they travel out of the country. Here in Cameroon, no amount of money is required from any individual, both natives and foreigners, before he is tested for COVID-19.
 
A day before I left Lagos for Cameroon for the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, I had to pay N50, 400 for my test. The practice was the same, when I travelled to Nairobi, Kenya, in August last year to cover the World U-20 Athletics Championship.
 
It has become the norm for every traveller in Nigeria to cough out N50, 400 since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. In some cases, travellers in Nigeria pay more, including extra charges, depending on where you go for the test.
 
At the Lagos airport, one is asked to produce his COVID-19 test result, which must be negative, before you are allowed to proceed. That is also normal in other countries.  “No payment,” the lady said. “Just sit down and do the test.”
 
Unlike the situation in Nigeria, where you have to wait for about 12 hours before getting the result, my COVID-19 test result inside Douala airport came out within five minutes. It was stamped negative.
 
Then, on Saturday morning, all journalists and fans had to do another COVID-19 test before the match between Nigeria and Sudan in Garoua. It was free, and it took less than five minutes for each of the results to come out.
