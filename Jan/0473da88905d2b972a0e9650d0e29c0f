•Danbatta urges youths to embrace digital skills acquisition Nigeria currently accounts for 82 per cent of Africa’s information and communications technology (ICT) market. This was made known by the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Danbatta, at the 10th and 11th combined Convocation Lecture of the Fountain University,  Osogbo, Osun State.
  
Danbatta, who delivered the convocation lecture, said the adoption and utilisation of ICT is synonymous with empowerment, as it transforms processes efficiently acting as an enabler of operations in every sector of the economy, including commerce, agriculture, health, security and governance.
 
In a paper titled: “Empowering the Nigerian youth through Information and Communication Technology”, Danbatta recalled the impact of ICT revolution in all parts of human endeavour across countries and continents, insisting that technology will continue to penetrate and foster qualitative and quantifiable changes in all aspects of life”.  The NCC boss stated that the foregoing contextual demonstrations of the possibilities of ICT explain Federal Government’s policy decisions to strengthen ICT adoption in building a robust digital economy in Nigeria, eloquently expressed in the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS), 2020-2030; the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025 and other series of policies, guidelines and regulations derivative of the NDEPS and NNBP.
  
He explained that adoption of digital revolution by the government is creating multiplier effects across critical sectors, aiding job creation, better governance, youth empowerment and overall socio-economic development. “It is the reason this objective reality is cited as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Indeed, for over 10 years, ICT has consistently contributed more than 10 per cent of Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – the telecom sector alone contributed 12.45 per cent to GDP as at the fourth quarter of 2020,” he said.
