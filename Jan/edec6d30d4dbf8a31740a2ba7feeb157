The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has called on taxpayers to file their last year’s tax returns before or on January 31, 2022. “The agency reminds businesses and employers of labour of their statutory obligation to file yearly income tax returns pursuant to section 81 (2) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) Cap P8 LFN 2004 (as amended). The Act stipulates January 31 as the deadline for filing of yearly income tax returns, failings,” a statement by the agency said. The Executive Chairman, Ayodele Subair, urged businesses and employers of labour residents in the state to file their yearly income tax returns within the stipulated deadline to avoid payment of sanctions. He advised those affected to leverage the e-tax portal “built for the convenience of taxpayers” for the purpose. “As part of the Agency’s quest to ease compliance obligations for taxpayers, it has designated some staff at its various offices to assist taxpayers with using the e-tax portal and other filing related issues,” he noted.
