The 2019 bop is one of the offerings from the enigmatic singer, who has announced that his debut soundpiece – an extended playlist (EP) dubbed, Feelings In Art, is scheduled for release next month. One of the core musical strengths of M.dikoy is his experimentation. The Osun indigene is a master of the fine art of sound fusion; he blends his rhythms to create abstract strains of melody that are as appealing as they are unique. He acknowledges that his love for rare melodies began from a tender age, as he grew up listening yo classics before starting songwriting at that age. Prior to starting music professionally, in 2015, with his debut single dubbed, Stay, M.dikoy had already honed his songwriting craft by writing poetry over the years. On the anticipated Feelings In Art, the producer-cum-singer notes that he is creating melodies “for the world to accept, and for the youths to relate to on an unlimited scale.” He also mentioned other artistes including Kizz Daniel , Makhadzi, Wande coal, Davido, among others, as his models in the industry.
