Ajulo urges understanding for S’West to clinch presidency The Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (ABAT) Movement, which is set to inaugurate its working committee for the actualisation of the presidential ambition of the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said it had set machinery in motion to mobilise considerable number of voters across Nigeria.
 
In a statement, its Chairman, Cardinal James Odumbaku, Director of Publicity and Communication, Mobolaji Sanusi and Director General, Alhaji Muhammed Oyinlomo Danmole, said the inauguration would hold on January 27 in Ikeja, Lagos. The statement reads in part: “Our core objective is to galvanise support across the federation for the enthronement of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu presidency in the coming 2023 elections.” In the interim, constitutional lawyer and Mayegun Aare Ona Kankanfo of Yorubaland, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, has called on Yoruba stakeholders to hold a strategic conference in the interest of the South West and the betterment of the nation at large as the 2023 presidential election approaches. He made the call while reacting to recent political developments in the region. The lawyer said crisis that may serve as a clog in the wheel of the region from producing the next President “is looming if the internal clash of interests rocking the region is not quickly and carefully managed by its stakeholders.”
