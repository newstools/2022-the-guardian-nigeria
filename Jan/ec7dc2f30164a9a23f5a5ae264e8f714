Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ekiti State Command, has arrested a 21-year-old sales boy, Tobiloba Olayinka, for allegedly plotting to kidnap his boss and extort a sum of N1.5 million ransom from him.
 
The Command also nabbed a 21-year-old Ayodeji Fanas, for stealing a sum of N500, 000.00 under the guise of helping his victim to purchase a vehicle.
   
The Commandant,  Mr. John Fayemi, further paraded one Daniel Emmanuel, who was alleged to have  stolen fabricated metals, saying the man became a suspect owing to his recurrent involvement in  nefarious crimes  in the area where the incident happened.  “After quick response of my men, he was botched after a discreet operation. He used fictitious names, accounts and telephone numbers to defraud his employer. We tracked his number and he was arrested.”
   
As for Fanas, the Commandant said that he was arrested for stealing a sum of N500,000.00 under the guise of helping his victim to purchase a vehicle. “After thorough investigation, we gathered that he used the money to buy phones for himself and various gifts for his girlfriend while also embarking on spending spree during yuletide by lying to his friend that it was his father that sent him a sum of N100,000 for Christmas and New year celebrations,” he said.
  
The commandant assured that all the suspects would be prosecuted after the conclusion of investigations into their matters. Fayemi regretted the upsurge of kidnapping in the society and internet fraud on campuses across the country,  predicating this on perception by youths that it was an opportunity to get rich quickly and easily.
  
He also described as mere insinuation, rumour that members of a certain ethnic group perpetrating crimes in Ekiti were being spared from arrest and prosecution.
