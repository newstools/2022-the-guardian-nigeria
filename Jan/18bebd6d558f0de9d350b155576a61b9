Lagos State Government on Tuesday suspended the operations of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the Idumota area of Lagos Island following the deadly clash recorded in the area. Lagos State Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotosho, announced their suspension. The suspension was announced after the arrest of two of its leaders in Lagos State, Kunle Poly and Tafa Sego in connection with a deadly clash on Lagos Island last week. Two persons were reportedly killed during a clash between two factional members of a transport union in the Idumota area of Lagos on Thursday. Meanwhile, the Lagos State chapter of the NURTW has apologised to the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, over the deadly clash. The union in a statement by its President, Tajudeen Baruwa, also backed the ongoing probe into the matter. While condemning the clash, Baruwa assured the Lagos State Government that erring members would be punished. “NURTW condemns the killings and attacks among members of the union, and the unrest that led to the death of people yet to be identified at Idumota axis of Lagos last week,” Baruwa said. “According to reports and viral Videos in the public domain, it is certain that an unconfirmed number of lives were lost during this ugly incident and the union will not rest until faces behind these actions are been fished out.”
