The military is committed to ending terrorism in the North East before the third quarter of this year, Theatre Commander of Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), Maj-Gen. Christopher Musa, has said. Musa stated this at the weekend in Maiduguri while celebrating the promotion of Acting General Officer Commanding, (GOC) 7 Division, Maj-Gen. Abdulwahab Eyitayo. He said: “We must be committed, as everybody is watching us in the theatre of war. It is our desire, by God’s grace, this year, to put an end to this insurgency in the North East.” The commander assured that this would ensure the restoration of peace and tranquility in the insurgency-affected states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. He, therefore, thanked Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State for the moral, physical and spiritual support to the theatre command. “The cooperation we enjoyed with you has make our work much easier with a marked difference,” he told Zulum, noting that successes are being recorded in the ongoing counter-terrorism operations. Responding, Zulum disclosed that Borno government would continue to provide support for the military to succeed in the joint counter-insurgency operations. He added: “We must fight insurgency because without fighting it, peace will never return to Nigeria.” On the return of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to communities, the governor said: “I am so happy as the governor because we’ve achieved a lot by retuning 690,000 people to Baga, Wulgo, Ngoshe and nine other liberated communities.” He added the only way to fight insurgency was for the IDP returnees to become resilient enough, noting that he could travel to any part of the state by night.
