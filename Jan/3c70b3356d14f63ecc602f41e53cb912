The Local Organising Committee (LOC) of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) and the Camerounian government have tightened security around the Super Eagles and other teams participating in the ongoing AFCON following the killing of a prominent lawyer and opposition lawmaker by suspected separatist fighters in the host country’s restive English-speaking North West region.
 
Opposition Senator, Henry Kemende, was reportedly shot dead at close range in the northwestern city of Bamenda, authorities from his party and the government said on Wednesday.
 
Kemende’s body was located after he “was killed by unidentified armed assailants,” an official said. Kemende was a lawyer turned Social Democratic Front (SDF) legislator, one of the main opposition parties in Cameroun.
