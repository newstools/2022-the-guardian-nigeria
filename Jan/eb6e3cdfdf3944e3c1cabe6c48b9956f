Threaten to begin strike on Monday National Assembly workers, under the aegis of Parliament Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), yesterday, staged a protest to demand payment of outstanding eight months minimum wage and 15 months Consolidated Peculiar (Conpeculiar) Allowances. PASAN Chairman (National Assembly), Sunday Sabiyi, and Vice Chairman, National Assembly Service Commission (NASC), M. A, Liman, who led the protest, also threatened to embark on strike beginning from Monday, January 10, 2022. They demanded full implementation of the National Minimum Wage signed into law in 2019 and the Revised Condition of Service. A communique issued yesterday, after the joint National Assembly/NASC Congress held in Abuja, containing the Congress’ resolution, was transmitted to Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Speaker, House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman, NASC, Ahmed Mashi; Director, Department of State Services (DSS); Divisional Police Officer (DPO) at the National Assembly; and Head of Sergeants-at-Arms. The workers, in the communique, accused National Assembly management of breaching the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) entered with PASAN on April 13, 2021, on the full implementation of the new National Minimum Wage Act 2019 and the Revised Condition of Service. The communique reads in part: “In view of the resolutions, Congress resolves to embark on industrial action, commencing with mass picketing from Monday, January 10, 2022, in protest of the breach of the MoU. “In view of the contravention above, the NASC/National Assembly joint emergency Congress resolves that management should pay, with immediate, effect five months outstanding balance of minimum wage; the year 2021 rent subsidy; 15 months arrears of Conpeculiar allowances, and six months arrears of hazard allowance. “In addition to the MoU, Congress also demands implementation of 50 per cent balance of Consolidated Legislative Salary Structure; immediate release of the year 2022 training template for staff; and evidence of provision of gratuity for retiring staff.”
