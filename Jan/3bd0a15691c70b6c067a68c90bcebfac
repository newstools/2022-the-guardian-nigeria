Ghana striker Benjamin Tetteh will serve a three-match suspension after punching an opponent during a mass brawl following Friday’s 1-1 draw with Gabon at the Africa Cup of Nations. Tensions boiled over as Ghana were enraged by a late equaliser that Gabon scored after opting not to return the ball when the Black Stars put it out of play after their midfielder Daniel-Kofi Kyereh went down injured. After a shoving match broke out on the pitch full-time, Tetteh took a swing at Gabon’s Aaron Boupendza and was later shown a red card by the referee.
