Speaking on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Wednesday, Stewart played a version of the game of “Two Truths and a Lie” called “Where’s The Lie, Martha?” While playing the game, she revealed the main reason she ended things with The Father actor. “I dated Sir Anthony Hopkins but broke up with him because I couldn’t stop thinking of him as Hannibal Lecter,” the clue read. While DeGeneres guessed this to be a lie, Stewart confirmed that it was indeed true. “I have a big scary house in Maine that’s way by itself on a hundred acres in the forest,” Stewart shared. “I couldn’t even imagine taking Anthony Hopkins there.” She added, “All I could think of was him eating, you know…” Hopkins played Hannibal Lecter, a serial killer who ate his victims, in 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and won an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1992 for the role. Star of the Martha Knows Best show, Stewart didn’t reveal when exactly they dated but spoke briefly of their relationship during an interview with Howard Stern back in 2006. She said at the time, per IMDB, “Oh, I loved him, but he was… scary. I was going to invite him up to Maine; I have this beautiful home in Maine… but then I reconsidered because I saw that movie again.” “Do you want someone eating your brain while you are sitting in your beautiful dining room in Maine?” she asked, adding, “I would have probably had a very nice relationship with Anthony Hopkins, but I couldn’t get past the Lecter thing.”
