The Chief Executive Officer of Medallion Data Centre Limited, Ikechukwu Nnamani, has commended Digital Realty for acquiring controlling stake in Africa’s largest datacenter operator, Teraco Data Environments of South Africa, in a transaction that valued at $3.5 billion. This represents the biggest datacenter transaction in the continent. Teraco is the largest and most densely interconnected data centre platform in Africa, with seven state-of-the-art facilities strategically located in the key South African metros of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.
   
Teraco serves over 600 customers, including more than 275 connectivity providers, over 25 cloud and content platforms and approximately 300 enterprises. Teraco facilitates approximately 22,000 interconnections between customers and its Isando campus in Johannesburg is one of the most densely interconnected sites in the world, with over 13,000 cross-connects.
  
Nnamani said the investment into Teraco by Digital Realty is a further testament that Digital Realty is fully committed to grow the digital economy in not only Nigeria and the West African sub-region but also the whole of Africa.
  
According to him, this will lead to significant foreign direct investment into the economy, boosting the GDP of the African countries, creating employment, and improving the quality of the lives of the citizens in the areas of education, healthcare, e-commerce, entertainment, security, governance, and agriculture amongst others. With the digitisation of the economy and implementation of Internet of Things services, datacenters are essential to support these emerging services.
