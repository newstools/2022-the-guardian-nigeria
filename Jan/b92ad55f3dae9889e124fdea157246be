• Egypt, Sudan relocate to Yaoundé
• We can’t afford to fail Nigerians, says Musa Super Eagles Interim Coach, Austin Eguavoen, has revealed that he will introduce some of the players that have not featured in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations in Nigeria’s line up for the last Group D match against Guinea Bissau on Wednesday. Eguavoen, whose team sealed a last 16 spot on Saturday through a 3-1 victory over the Falcons of Sudan, said after yesterday’s light training in Garoua that he would rest some players and give others chance in the tournament. Nigeria has already qualified for the round of 16 of the ongoing AFCON and needs a draw with Guinea Bissau to win Group D and remain in Garoua for its round of 16 match. Eguavoen has deployed only 14 players from his 27-man squad in Nigeria’s two games so far. Earlier yesterday, Team Captain, Ahmed Musa, promised that the Super Eagles would do everything possible to win the competition for their supporters.
 
Musa, who came in as a substitute in Nigeria’s second group match against Sudan, which the Eagles won 3-1, told The Guardian yesterday shortly after their training that they are focused on the task ahead, which is to make Nigerians proud.
 
“We cannot afford to fail in this tournament. I know that every country in this competition wants to win, but we are very hungry for the title.”
Musa also described as untrue report by a Nigerian sporting newspaper that there is disquiet in the team’s camp over bonuses. He said: “Nobody is talking about match bonuses for now. Our focus is to top the group and go on to win our quarterfinal game, semifinal and the final.
 
“We know we have the quality to win the title and we will work hard to achieve it.  That is our ambition. I am sure it will come to pass.” Meanwhile, the Pharaohs of Egypt and their Sudanese counterparts left Garoua yesterday morning for Yaoundé for their last group match, which will be played simultaneously with the match between Nigeria and Guinea Bissau on Wednesday. While Egypt needs a draw in that game to finish second behind Nigeria, Sudan must beat the Pharaohs to stand the chance of making the round of 16.
