Gov. Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has pledged N25 million support for his alma-mater, the University of Lagos,(UNILAG) Akoka, to enable the institution host the Nigerian Universities Games (NUGA). He made the pledge, on Friday, while receiving a delegation of the University, led by its Vice Chancellor, Prof. Toyin Ogundipe, in his office at State Secretariat, Agodi, Ibadan. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that UNILAG will host the 2022 NUGA from March 16 to March 26. Makinde, who said he would donate the money in his private capacity to the success of the games, commended the Vice Chancellor and his team for transforming the institution, especially, the sports centre. He said: “Well, let me wish you well and I know UNILAG, they can’t find us wanting when it comes to organisation and when it comes to commitment and putting up a very good show. “When they say ‘Eko for Show’, and I remember I left UNILAG in 1990, from that time till now I have had the opportunity to come back to UNILAG’s sports centre and I see that it has undergone tremendous transformation. “At this stage, the only thing we can do is support UNILAG to bring out the best show for this period, and personally I would support.” Makinde also promised to appeal to his counterparts and friends of the institution to assist his alma mater over the hosting of the games. Earlier, Ogundipe said that UNILAG was in need of assistance that would make the NUGA games the best and most successful.
He said that Makinde’s contributions toward the development of his department, faculty and institution, could not be underrated. Ogundipe commended the Makinde-led administration on the good works being done across the state. He described the governor as a worthy and distinguished alumnus of UNILAG.
