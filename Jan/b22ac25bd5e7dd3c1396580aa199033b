Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Prince Tonye Princewill, has said party members in the state are still suffering the consequences of the fight between former President Goodluck Jonathan and his wife versus the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi. According to Princewill, the ex-President’s role in the marginalisation of their fellow Ijaw’s interest for the governor of the state in 2015 contributed to making the party  lose elections. In a statement made available to newsmen in Port Harcourt, yesterday, Princewill said: “Some of us in Rivers State, who fell victim to the imposition of Wike on us in 2015, remember the role of our former President and his wife in the marginalisation of their fellow Ijaw’s interest for the governor of Rivers State. Like we later suffered in the 2019 election too, a desire to settle personal scores with Amaechi also contributed to make us lose that election too. We are still suffering the consequences today. But it’s politics, it isn’t personal. Let’s leave speculation, my father taught me not to believe in my breakfast until I’ve eaten it. If the former President comes to join us, we will give him a special welcome.”
