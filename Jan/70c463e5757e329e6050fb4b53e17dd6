Adele made this announcement in an emotional video she shared on Instagram apologizing to her fans for rescheduling the concert dates as her team has been “up against so much.” Adele said tearfully, “Hi, listen, I’m so sorry, but my show ain’t ready. We tried absolutely everything that we can to put it together in time and for it to be good enough for you, but we’ve been absolutely destroyed by delivery delays and COVID. Half my crew, half my team are down with COVID — they still are.”   A post shared by Adele (@adele) She continued, “It’s been impossible to finish the show — and I can’t give you what I have right now. I’m tired. I’m tired. I’m sorry it’s so last minute, we’ve been awake for over 30 hours now trying to figure it out, and we’ve run out of time.” Assuring fans that the show will still happen, she said, “I’m so upset, and I’m really embarrassed and so sorry to everyone that’s traveled again. I’m really, really sorry, I’m really sorry. We’re on it, we’re gonna reschedule all of the dates, we’re on it right now, and I’m gonna finish my show, and I’m gonna get it to where it’s supposed to be. I’m so sorry it’s been impossible, we’ve been up against so much, and it just ain’t ready. I’m really sorry.” Adele’s Las Vegas residency Weekends With Adele was scheduled to begin on January 21 and run till April 16, with two shows each weekend. In November, Adele first announced the residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace just after the release of her fourth studio album, 30. Announcing their support for Adele’s decisions, Caesars Palace noted that they would be issuing concertgoers with hotel reservations full refunds, while those already at the hotel could get refunds for their Friday and Saturday night stays. However, Adele did not announce if there has been a change in her London’s Hyde Park performance scheduled to hold in July.
