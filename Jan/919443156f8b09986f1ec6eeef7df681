Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State deserves commendation for fulfilling his promise to set up the Ebubeagu security outfit to protect lives and property, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Barr. Orji Uchenna Orji, has said.
 
According to him, the story of the leadership actualisations of Governor Umahi could best be appreciated when juxtaposed with similar promises he made during his inaugural addresses for both the first and second terms of his administration in 2015 and 2019 respectively.
   
Orji explained that despite attempts by disgruntled elements to politicise the issue of security in the state, Umahi rode on the resolutions of the five South East state governors to establish the Ebonyi State Command of the Ebubeagu security outfit.  He said: “We brainstormed and set up a committee headed by General Obi Umahi (rtd), which had since rounded off their assignment. We appreciate the wonderful cooperation they offered. Ebonyi was the second to sign into law the bill for the establishment of Ebubeagu after Imo State.
  
“Its function is to assist the police in carrying out lawful activities. It is not an alternate police force. They are to operate in utter obedience to the police force. No altercation. Don’t fight or disobey the police.”
 
In an interaction with The Guardian, Orji asserted that contrary to insinuations in some quarters, Umahi made it clear that the establishment of the Ebubeagu security outfit was not politically motivated.
