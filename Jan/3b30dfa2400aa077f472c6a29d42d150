Analysts at Investdata Consulting Limited said: “We expect a mixed trend as repositioning in dividend-paying stocks ahead of 2021 Q4 and full year unaudited earnings reports start rowing in any moment from next week. “Just as two companies that made their corporate actions available to the market grew their dividend payout to reflect the numbers posted. “Also, inflow into equities space is looking up slowly on changing investment decisions to keep this trend ahead of New Year holiday.” On the price movement chart, Airtel led the gainers’ chart with 10 per cent to close at N1,050.50 kobo while Oando followed with 9.73 per cent to close at N4.85 kobo.
