Fox announced through her Instagram when the actress shared a video of the engagement on her handle. In her post, she noted that the engagement happened on January 11. “Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together, and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him,” she wrote. “And just as in every lifetime before this one, and as in every lifetime that will follow it, I said yes….and then we drank each other’s blood.”   A post shared by Guardian Life Magazine (@guardianlifeng)  Their relationship has been passion-fueled with their public declarations of love and displays of affection, making them tabloids’ favourite couple as the pair sometimes share unique tributes to one another. (Remember Machine Gun Kelly’s blood necklace?) In September 2020, the musician opened up to Howard Stern about meeting Fox on the set of the film “Midnight in the Switchgrass.” “I didn’t know what that was until me and her made eye contact,” Kelly said. “That’s when I was like, ‘Whoa.’”
This would be the first marriage for Machine Gun Kelly, who has a daughter from a previous relationship.
Fox was previously married to actor Brian Austin Green, with whom she shares three children.
