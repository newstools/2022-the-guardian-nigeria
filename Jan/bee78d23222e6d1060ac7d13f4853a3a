Cannon, 41, is expecting a child with model Bre Tiesi and will be her first for him. In a photo that surfaced on the internet, the two were smiling with joy at a private gender reveal party in Malibu. The blue confetti cannons shot by guests on Saturday clearly confirmed they were expecting a baby boy. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1655958 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ-815x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="939" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ-815x598.jpg 815w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ-320x235.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ-640x469.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ-600x440.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nick-Cannon-and-Bre-Tiesi.-Photo-TMZ.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The good news comes after the “Masked Singer” host continues to mourn the loss of his son Zen, who died at five months old from brain cancer in December 2021. Bre showed off her burgeoning bump in a strapless white mini-dress with a large bow in the back with matching spike-heeled pumps. And Nick harmonised his wear with his future baby mama in his all-white sweats, beanie and sneakers. It’s unclear when Cannon and Tiesi began their romance, but they’ve known each other for at least six years. It seems that Nick is not holding off on broadening his family with his eighth addition. Recall that he said about his celibacy, “I told you, man, I’m celibate right now. I’m going to see if I could make it to 2022. I’m trying to chill out though. I’m chillin’, I’m kind of stepping away, getting focused, going within, getting my celibacy on. I have enough children, enough frolicking, I’m good right now.”
