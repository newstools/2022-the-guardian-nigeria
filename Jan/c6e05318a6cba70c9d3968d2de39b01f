Aubrey posted a screengrab of the text message from the comedian, which was sent while he was on his I Don’t Do Negative stand-up tour. “Thank u. Love u. Showtime!” he wrote to her. The Full House actor, who passed away on Sunday aged 65, was found dead in a hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton Orlando, Grande Lakes. He had performed at the Ponte Cedra Concert Hall outside Jacksonville. Confirming this death, the Saget family said in a statement to CNN, “We are devastated to confirm that our beloved Bob passed away today.” “He was everything to us, and we want you to know how much he loved his fans, performing live and bringing people from all walks of life together with laughter. Though we ask for privacy at this time, we invite you to join us in remembering the love and laughter that Bob brought to the world.” Saget shared a selfie from his Saturday’s performance on Instagram. Captioning the photo, he wrote, “Okay, I loved tonight’s show @pontevedra_concerthall in Jacksonville. Really nice audience. Lots of positivity,” he captioned the post. “Happened last night in Orlando last night at the Hard Rock Live too. Very appreciative and fun audiences. Thanks again to @comediantimwilkins for opening. I had no idea I did a two hour set tonight.” “I’m back in comedy like I was when I was 26. I guess I’m finding my new voice and loving every moment of it,” he added. “A’ight, see you in two weeks Jan. 28 & 29 @pbimprov with my brother @therealmikeyoung — And check BobSaget.com for my dates in 2022 — Goin’ everywhere until I get the special shot. And then probably keep going cause I’m addicted to this s—. Peace out. .” Confirming Safet’s death, the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, in a statement, said, “The man was identified as Robert Saget & pronounced deceased on scene. Detectives found no signs of foul play or drug use in this case.” The statement also added that the medical examiner will determine the cause of death.
