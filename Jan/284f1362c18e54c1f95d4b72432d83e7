Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, left Abuja for Accra, Ghana to represent President Muhammadu Buhari at an Extraordinary Summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Authority of Heads of State and Government to discuss the political situation in the Republic of Mali. The meeting follows previous efforts by the sub-regional leaders to restore the civil rule in Mali and Guinea. Last year, Osinbajo participated in similar meetings where sanctions were imposed separately on the military juntas in both nations. In compliance with the decisions of the leaders, ECOWAS mediator and Nigeria’s former President, Goodluck Jonathan, was in Mali on January 5, 2022, to meet with the authorities over the timetable for democratic transition. Indeed, Dr. Jonathan briefed President Muhammadu Buhari on the matter recently. The Vice President, who is accompanied by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, will be back today.
