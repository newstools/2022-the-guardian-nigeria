The Chairman, Magodo GRA Phase 1, Gateway Zone, Mr. Ayo Fasugba, has appealed to the Inspector-General of Police to call his men to order over the constant support provided by Police officers to persons he described as land grabbers who demolished a section of the estate to access a wetland. In a statement, yesterday, he said: “We want the perpetrators of the dastardly act to be arrested and prosecuted by the Nigeria Police Force and we are seeking Police protection while we make efforts to rebuild the segment of our fence that was demolished by the hoodlums. “It is so worrisome and the situation and apprehension are so heightened that our residents are now very uncomfortable about these criminal elements’ next moves. “This should have ordinarily been an issue between the land grabbers and the government because their target is a huge gorge or marshland (wetland), that has been declared inhabitable by environmentalists, but it is an irony that we are now the ones confronting a very vicious group that seems to have the active support of some top law-enforcement officers.” Fasugba said the estate has always enjoyed remarkable tranquility and good security until a group of land grabbers generally referred to as ‘Omonile’ started invading and infiltrating the estate under the guise that they need another access road to a wetland space they claim they want to sell or develop. “Their attraction for access through Gateway Zone is due to the level of infrastructural developments championed by the CDA.” He claimed that the attention of relevant government parastatals had been drawn to the issue after several invasions from the land grabbers. “Despite several letters from various state government agencies affirming the right of the estate, the threats and attacks had persisted.”
