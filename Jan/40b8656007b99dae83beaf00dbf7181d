It explained that Foreign Exchange (FX), CBN3 Special Bills (SB) and OMO4 bills were the highest drivers of market turnover, jointly accounting for 60.63 per cent of the total FIC markets turnover in December 2021, mainly due to an increase in FX supply and a 452.71 per cent (₦1.72 trillion) increase in secondary market activity for CBN special bills. In the OTC FX Futures market, the near month contract (NGUS DEC 29, 2021) expired and open positions with a total Notional Value (NV) of $0.55 billion were settled.

On market activity, the total number of executed trades reported on FMDQ trading systems decreased by 14.34 per cent to 3,326 in December 2021, driven mainly by the monthly decrease in trading activity for T-bills and OMO Bills. This offset the monthly increase in CBN special bills and FGN bonds. Furthermore, daily average trade size in December 2021 was ₦19 trillion compared to ₦18 trillion in November 2021, mainly driven by the 257.08 per cent (N2 trillion) increase in the daily average trade size of CBN special bills. Total turnover in the money market segment increased monthly by 23.41 per cent from  ₦96 trillion to ₦5.06 trillion in December 2021.
