The two factions in the Nigeria Basketball Federation leadership crisis may hold parallel elections in Abuja and Benin today following the failure of reconciliation efforts by the ministry of sports. While the Musa Kida-led faction has scheduled its election for Benin City, another group opposed to the immediate past NBBF president and allegedly backed by the sports ministry has scheduled their polls for Abuja. One of the contestants, who pleaded anonymity, told The Guardian that delegates are set for the elections in Abuja today, but NBBF Secretary, Bisi Afolabi, declined comments on the elections.
 
Meanwhile, the Dr. Lanre Glover-led electoral committee has cleared eight candidates for the polls billed for Benin City. Among the candidates cleared for the elections is immediate past NBBF President, Musa Kida, who is vying for another term in office. He is the South-South Zonal Representative position on the board. The South West zone promises to be fiercely contested as former national team captain, Olumide Oyedeji, is challenging immediate past NBBF vice president, Babs Ogunade, for the zonal ticket. Anambra State Basketball Chairman, Ugo Udezue, is the sole candidate from the South East zone, just as Alhaji Abba Kaka Abdulkadir has been cleared to contest as the North East representative on the board, while Adamu Deshi Janlong is hoping to represent the North Central Zone. Yusuf Surajo has the mandate to represent the North West on the NBBF board. The delegates were expected to arrive in Benin yesterday, while accreditation and elections will hold today.
