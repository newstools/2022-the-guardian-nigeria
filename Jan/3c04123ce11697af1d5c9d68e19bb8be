An official of the Super Eagles has dismissed claims that the players were grumbling over unpaid match bonuses. Nigeria defeated Egypt 1-0 and Sudan 3-1, yesterday in their first and second games of the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon. A Nigerian newspaper had yesterday, reported an alleged “Disquiet in Eagles camp” over bonuses, but the official ruled it out as untrue, stressing that there was nothing of such. Speaking with The Guardian at the Super Eagles camp in Garuoa, shortly before the game against Sudan, yesterday, the official said that the publication was a mere fabrication by the writer. “We just played one match here and we are preparing for the second game against Sudan. There is nothing to suggest such a headline because nobody is protesting over bonuses. “What we need now is encouragement from the media and not stories that will create bad blood between the players and Nigerians. I repeat once again that there is no disquiet in the Super Eagles camp,” the official said. Asked if the players and their coaches have been paid bonuses for the victory against the Pharaohs of Egypt, the official said: “Payment of winning bonuses is not supposed to be discussed on the pages of newspapers. It is between the team and the NFF. But as I said, we don’t have any disquiet in the team over unpaid match bonuses.”
