I Go Dye made this dedication on Instagram sharing a picture of himself with the award. “I wholeheartedly dedicate this United Nations Eminent Global Peace Advocate Appointment and Award bestowed on me to the victims of the EndSARS protest and the judiciary panel that gave some insight and recommendations to curb the future occurrence of such actions.” “Our pains are widened by the gap of poverty, unemployment, and injustice. I appeal to the Government to look into the judicial panel’s recommendation and seek a better means to reward Nigerians with economic policies that will caution against the effect of poverty that’s motivating the criminal tendency across the Nation because declaring any group as terrorists is not enough to stop crime.”   A post shared by Igodye (@igodye_) “Government must create a secured environment especially the power failure for investors so that our youths can get employment, because no matter how much is spent on war or purchasing military equipment, none can stop the frustrated man from embracing violence as a means of survival.” “When we fail to promote peace by our simple failure to care for the less privileged and reduce the poverty index in our country, crime will certainly increase,” he continued. The #EndSARS protests saw Nigerian youths unite against police brutality and oppression. However, the protests took a sour turn on October 20, 2020, after the Nigerian army opened fire on peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate, killing many in what has been tagged the Lekki Massacre. I Go Dye has been appointed an ambassador for prestigious organisations, including Africa Child Ambassador, a UKAid ambassador, a MADACT (Making A Difference Against Corruption Today), Ambassador, and World Habitat Ambassador, and Sustainable Development Ambassador.
