Popularly known as Lala in the Yoruba film circle, Oladapo hardly cuts a bookish figure. But his desire for more education has been a life-long dream, he said. “I am not relenting because I want to attain the highest level of education,” Oladapo said on his Instagram page. “I am grateful to God for the success of my second-degree education. It took me concerted effort in achieving this because there were lots of distractions.” Oladapo got his first degree in Dramatic Arts from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife in 2015. The actor said his latest degree is just a “stepping stone” for him. “I have always had a burning passion for attaining a greater height in education from my tender age and I thank God I achieved the dream despite fame and other engagements.”
