The Federal Government invested N152 billion in digitisation of its activities in 2021, even as it revealed plans of migrating all government paper activities to paperless by 2030.
  
The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim disclosed this during the Champion Day and Closing of 2021 Service Wide Capacity Building program on e-Government.  Head of Service Civil of Federation (HoSCF), Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan disclosed that many Ministries, Departments, and Agencies of government were on the verge of digitalising their processes. She assured that by the end of the year, many successes would have been recorded in the nation’s journey to digitalisation. While commending the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy and its parastatals for the support in ensuring that processes at the Office of Head of Service for the Federation were digitalised, she noted that “the gestures would go a long way in assisting us to achieve our own dream.” Yemi-Esan thanked NITDA for the role it is playing in getting the Office of Head of Service of the Federation a platform that would enhance digitalisation of government processes.
