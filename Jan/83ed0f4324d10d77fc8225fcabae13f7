In its bid to boost self-employment, the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has trained 25 unemployed graduates on solar power installation and maintenance. The training was conducted in Kogi state, under the NDE Solar Training Scheme of the Special Public Works Programme and aimed at providing the participants with the needed skills to become self-employed. In his keynote address, the Director General of NDE, Mallam Abubakar Nuhu Fikpo, which was delivered by the Kogi State Coordinator of NDE, Abubakar Zakari, called on the trainees to take the training seriously as it would serve as a life changing opportunity for them. The Director General noted that many were looking forward to the rare privileged, hence the need for the beneficiaries to make good use of the opportunity in improving upon their living standard. He described Solar Energy as the only alternative towards boosting regular power supply in Nigeria, saying the knowledge acquired would be of great economic value to the nation. Fikpo, therefore, urged the participants to appreciate the management of NDE for considering them for the free training. One of the resource persons, Anselem Egbugha, in his presentation at the workshop, charged the unemployed graduates to see the training as a great privilege. Speaking on behalf of the trainees, Mr. Sam Moses said that they would forever remain grateful to NDE for the opportunity.
