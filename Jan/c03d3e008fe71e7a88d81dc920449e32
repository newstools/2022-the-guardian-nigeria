Sir: In every country, few people are blessed with outstanding divine favour and qualities in leading the struggle for the benefit of the governed including the yet unborn as a service to humanity. Nigeria is one of those countries that witnessed such kind of historical backing by these fallen heroes as people of proven integrity in all spheres of life which put the interest of the people and that of the country above any other thing. The saying that nothing good comes easy has no doubt proved the testimony of our past leaders who led by example as the servants not leaders to their followers in enduring uncountable number of potholes as well as resisting both internal and external pressure, to cross the bridge of slavery, economic exploitation and racial segregation in the hands of the dictators thereby striving hard towards achieving the present day Nigeria. Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, the first and only Nigeria’s Prime Minister who hailed from Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area in Southern part of Bauchi State could be seen as the number one citizen, commandant or civilian general at the forefront of the battle without any sophisticated weapons at his disposal but honesty and the zeal at heart as the acumen he possessed in securing the country from the shackles of colonial rule to gain independence. His assassination by the enemies of progress, during a bloody coup d’etat on January 15,1966 in Lagos should be viewed as a capital offence and abomination for bringing an end, life of the Nigeria’s hero who had danced well according to his tune in building a roadmap to socio economic growth of his fatherland in all aspects of human endeavours I will not be mistaken to say the author of eight parts of speech, Jennifer Betts, has made an under publication for not including additional adjective that could be used to qualify nature of sacrifice, devotion and patriotism made by Balewa and the likes not only in the country but entire African continent, taking into cognisance his good command in oratory while speech making in the midst of the white men towards achieving a greater unified Nigeria which earned him the name Golden Voice Of Africa. Memories of the indefatigable and charismatic man who put two of his hands on the plough to be part of all the processes that led to the birth and ground breaking ceremony of the country’s independence shall continue to linger not only in the minds of his immediate family members, Northern Nigeria but fellow citizens for his commitment in selfless service to the society. As January 15, 2022 marks 56 years of mourning your death which is inevitable, with the Islamic belief that says kullu nafsin za’ikatul ma’aut, meaning every soul on earth shall taste death, may Allah comfort you with Janatul Firdaus as a final abode. Adamu Yalwa Gabi.
