North Central Nigeria for Good Governance (NCNGG) has thrown its support behind former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, for the 2023 Presidential race. The group led by Fagbemi Taofeek stated in Ilorin, Kwara State, yesterday, that five unique attributes stand Saraki out among other aspirants to the exalted post. Fagbemi, who led his members across six states of the North Central geo-political zone at a press briefing, urged Nigerians to start routing for the politician to take Nigeria to its Eldorado. According to the NCNGG coordinator, Saraki, a two-term governor with outstanding achievement in office, is combining executive experience with legislative understanding. Besides, he said the former Kwara governor remained the most tolerant politician, who though, a practising Muslim, is married to a Christian, adding: “Recently, he gave out his daughter to a Christian faithful in a society wedding in Ilorin. “Two major issues are giving Nigerians problems today – religion and ethnicity. This enigmatic politician from Ilorin has both Fulani and Yoruba identities. Remember that his wife is from Lagos. His major friends are from Niger Delta and the South East. He will not over-concentrate on Kwara alone or North Central zones to the exclusion of other Nigerians.”
