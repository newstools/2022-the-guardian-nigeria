President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olumide Akpata, yesterday, hinted that a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and six other lawyers believed to have aided judges in the issuance of conflicting orders might soon face the Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee. He made the disclosure at a press conference in Abuja, where he addressed stakeholders on the rationale behind this year’s Justice Sector Summit held today in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It is organised by NBA in conjunction with others. Akpata, while fielding questions from journalists on the position of the association’s committee earlier set up to look into the roles of lawyers in the issuance of conflicting orders by some judges, confirmed that a full report had been submitted to the body’s National Executive Council (NEC). He stated that those found wanting “may soon face the association’s disciplinary committee.” Founding member, Justice Reform Project (JRP), Osaro Eghobamien (left); Head of Konrad Adenauer Foundation (KAS) Nigeria, Dr. Vladimir Kreck; President, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Olumide Akpata; General Secretary, Joyce Oduah; Chairman, Organising Committee of the Justice Sector Summit (JSS) 2022, Dr. Babatunde Ajibade and Executive Director, Justice Research Initiative (JRI), Ikem Isiekwena, at a press conference to announce the summit in Abuja…yesterday.

Akpata regretted that there had been a serious gap in the justice system, especially in the area of judges’ appointments, funding of the sector and undue delays of litigations. He went on: “We have gone past the stage where someone would sit in the comfort of chambers pointing which lawyer they think should be the judge.” Akpata clarified that as part of efforts to remedy these anomalies the NBA, in collaboration with other groups, is organising the summit. Vice President Yemi Osibanjo, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan and Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Muhammad, are among dignitaries that would speak at the event, themed, “Devising Practical Solutions Towards Improved Performance, Enhanced Accountability” and organised by the NBA and the Justice Research Institute (JRI) in partnership with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and Justice Reform Project (JRP).
