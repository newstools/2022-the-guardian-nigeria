Designers of all forms across the world created new styles, breaking from the norm the fashion world is used to. These new fashions, however unusual, became a trend largely accepted by the public. This ushered in a new dimension of style allowing many to explore and incorporate their style. Here are a few of the fashion trends that rocked 2021: Full Face mask Kim Kardashian.

This year, the wearing of full-face masks found its way into contemporary fashion and became a fashionable trend. People accessorised their outfits with full face masks. From evening wear to everyday outfits, and street fashion outfits, full face masks crowned it all. There was the bedazzled face mask, satin, and metallic amongst others. Fashion icons from Kim Kardashian to Kanye West, Wizkid and many more finessed the full face mask trend, giving different unique styles that won’t be forgotten in a hurry. Big / Oversized shoes One would think this would never have become fashionable because of the funny look it adds to one’s appearance. However, big and oversized shoes took 2021 by storm and many fell in love with the style. This oversized footwear, also known as mascot shoes, allowed many to let go of some of the discomforts that come with wearing shoes fitted to your size. In a fashion article by Vogue, a wearer of oversized shoes revealed that the feeling of wearing oversized shoes is like a walking foot massage cradled by delicious padded foam and kissed by a puffer coat. I guess one wouldn’t have to worry about smelly feet and hurting toes that sometimes occur from wearing fitted shoes. This is no doubt a trend that places comfort over looks. Rocking tracksuits and joggers Ebuka | TheOlaofLagos Toke Makinwa | Instagram Coming fresh out of covid lockdown took its toll on the fashion world. Being indoors for over a year ushered in the wearing of tracksuits and joggers for outdoor activities. Before now, tracksuits and joggers were mostly worn indoors and to the gym. 2021 flipped it over and turned these wears into an everyday fashion. Many across the world went around wearing joggers and tracksuits while going about their daily activities. The comfort they brought made it a style wholeheartedly accepted worldwide. During the covid lockdown, many around the globe spoke about gaining weight and losing fitness due to the cancellation of outdoor activities. So, joggers helped give confidence to individuals who didn’t feel comfortable in their post lockdown bodies. Most importantly, tracksuits and joggers introduced a cool street style touch to fashion. Tik-Tok body shaper leggings The wearing of body shapers is not alien to the beauty and fashion world but, the TikTok tummy tighter and butt lifter leggings came fresh with 2021. It started as just a fashion haul trend on TikTok and many fell in love with how it made their bodies appear. With this, it went on to become a part of fashion worldwide. The famous TikTok leggings helped to snatch the waist and lift the butt cheeks, giving women the hourglass figure. However, some revealed it didn’t work for their bodies but it largely got good reviews. Making it a great choice of wear to many and not have them worry about their tummy and hips. Y2K Y2K.
