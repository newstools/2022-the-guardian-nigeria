The Police Force (NPF) has extended the online registration of its 2021 recruitment into the service for constables to midnight of January 22. Records show that 81,005 applications were received nationwide as of January 7. Of the figure, only 1,404 requests  (less than two per cent of the total) came from the five South-East states, with 261 from Lagos. Anambra posted the least figure of 158 applicants. Consequently, the force enjoined states, council areas, religious bodies and other interest groups in the affected geopolitical zones and Lagos State to assist in mobilising and encouraging their citizens and wards to take advantage of the opportunity to seek a career path in the force. Interested applicants are urged to log on to the NPF recruitment portal, http://www.policerecruitment.gov.ng to register before the expiration of the new deadline.
