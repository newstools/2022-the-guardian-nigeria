Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has debunked reports that it has endorsed former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu for president. The secretary-general of the association Alhaji Baba Ngelzarma said in a statement on Wednesday that members of the association who endorsed Tinubu did so as individuals. “We want to make it clear that the association has not endorsed any candidate,” Ngelzarma said. “Those who endorsed Tinubu are doing so as individuals, as MACBAN should not in any way be dragged into the politics of endorsement at this stage.” Tinubu is one of a few members of the ruling All Progressives Congress that have shown interest in succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. The APC chief has not made a formal declaration but he told journalists earlier in the month that he has informed the president of his ambition. “I have informed the President of my ambition but I have not informed Nigerians yet, I am still consulting. There’s nowhere in the world where a kingmaker cannot himself be king. “About the cap of a kingmaker. I’ve never seen the cap of a kingmaker before. That is the truth. And I have never seen where it is written in the rulebook anywhere in any country that a kingmaker cannot be a king unless he has committed murder,” he said. So, whatever you write is your own opinion. Me, I want to pursue my ambition without the title of a kingmaker.” The former Lagos State governor added that he plans to actualise his ambition under the platform of the ruling APC, noting that with what he did in Lagos in his time as governor, he has the capacity to lead Nigeria. “You will soon hear. All you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You’ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr President of my ambition, and you don’t expect more answers than that,” he said.
