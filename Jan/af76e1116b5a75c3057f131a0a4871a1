The video released on Monday features fabulous costumes and vibrant dance moves. The video opens up with Perry on the phone in a phone booth, and she says, “You know, I think it’s just time to give them everything they want.” Just as the song starts to play in the background, she drops the phone and strides out of the booth into a factory with her robot dog. Perry changes into a brown mini dress and white boots in the factory with her signature dark hair flowing down her back. Joined by dancers, she sings, “Thought it would be easy / Easy to forget me / Let go of the memories / Now your bed is empty / And you’re waking up, sweating / I’m still in your wild dreams.” Midway into the video Swedish Producer DJ Alesso makes a dramatic entrance into the factory. Katy Perry debuted the When I’m Gone video at the 2022 College Football Playoff National Championship halftime. This was the first time ESPN has shared a music video across networks during a live broadcast. “When it comes to my music videos, we all know I like to push the boundaries and myself, and create unique opportunities for my fans to see them,” Perry said in a press release before the video’s premiere. “ESPN and especially College GameDay hold a special place in my heart, so partnering with Alesso to become the first artists to ever debut a global music video within a live event on ESPN made for a perfect and natural pairing,” she added. When I’m Gone is Katty Perry’s first single since the release of her album, Smile, in August 2020. Since its release, the pop single has blown up, recording over 10 million streams in under a week. She recently launched her Las Vegas residency, Play, in late December at Resorts World and is set to perform 16 shows through March. “A lot of my shows have been figuratively larger than life, but I play a doll in this show, so everything is like three times the size of me,” she said to Good Morning America. “It’s Honey I Shrunk the Kids meets Pee-wee’s Playhouse, but we knew what our audience is. People are here to have fun, people are here to let loose.” See the music video HERE:
