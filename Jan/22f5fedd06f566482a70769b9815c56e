Residents of Jattu, Auchi and neighbouring towns in Edo State have applauded the government for the Light-up Edo Project (Phase I), which has attracted the installation of 283 solar streetlights at strategic locations on the major roads linking the towns in the northern part of the state. They commended the government for prioritising safety, security and for restoring a night economy in the area. The light-up Edo project is part of the efforts of the government to transform the state into the preferred business destination in Nigeria, improve security and raise the standards of living of residents. According to the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Electricity, Edo State, Stephen Uyiekpen, the solar street light project covers the ever-busy Auchi-Jattu road and Jattu-Otaru Polytechnic Road. He added: “The Jattu-Otaru Polytechnic Road has 105 solar street lights installed about 3.3km, starting from the polytechnic gate, while the Auchi-Jattu township Road, which is about 4.9km has a total of 178 solar street lights installed.” Uyiekpen said that the LED lamps have a minimum life span of over five years lasting 50,000 hours and 120-Watts capacity. Also speaking, some traders in the area, thanked the governor for bringing good governance to their doorsteps as the project has helped to eliminate security threats.
