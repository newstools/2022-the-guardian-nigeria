Taking to Instagram on Friday, Ye wrote that he would like to ensure all T’s are crossed and I’s dotted before he green lights the three-part series Jeen-Yuhs. “I’m going to say this kindly for the last time,” he wrote. “I must get final edit and approval on this doc before it releases on Netflix.” “Open the edit room immediately so I can be in charge of my own image.” “Thank you in advance ” he captioned his IG post, which included the artwork for the documentary. The trilogy follows Ye’s 20-year career, including his music, business ventures, his 2020 presidential run and the loss of his mom, Donda West, whom he named his latest album after. Jeen-Yuhs is scheduled to debut at the Sundance Film Festival on Sunday (Jan. 23) and is expected to hit Netflix sometime next month.
