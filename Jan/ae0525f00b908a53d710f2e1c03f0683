The National Assembly has been urged to withdraw, review and redraft the Nigeria Customs Service bill currently before it.
President, National Association of Managing Directors of Customs Licensed Agents, Lucky Amiwero, in a document presented to the House Committee On Customs And Excise, said in the draft bill, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) was unduly allocated with uncontrollable powers over the President, The Ministers and other government agencies on policy making, regulation of the economy on trade and Fiscal policies and other matters, which negate the principle of global best practice on administration, control and management of Trade/Customs Act. 
 
He said that due to the importance of the Customs and Excise Management Act to the economy as an instrument that assists the federal government to formulate proper Trade and fiscal policy direction, the draft bill must be withdrawn, reviewed and redrafted.
 
 Amiwero, who is also a member of the Reconstituted Presidential Task Force For The Reform of Nigeria Customs Service (RPTFCR), alleged that all powers of the president and minister are to be exercised by the Comptroller-General of Customs in the bill.  The Customs Act globally, is a legal instrument that is applied by the executive arm of government to regulate the economy through proper articulation of trade and fiscal policy direction.
