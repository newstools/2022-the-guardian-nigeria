President of the Super Eagles Supporters Club, Vincent Okumagba, is leading a large delegation of Nigerians to Garoua, Cameroun, tomorrow, to strengthen the team’s support for the last group match against Guinea Bissau.
 
Though over 150 members of the Super Eagles Supporters Club, led by the Public Relations Officer, Mr. Toye, have been on ground, drumming and offering the players motivational songs since the beginning of the competition, Okumagba said there is need to increase the support for the team.
 
“I am coming with about 50 members on Tuesday. I have secured their tickets already, and we will stay till the final of the tournament. About 150 of our members are on ground in Garoua with the team, but I feel there is the need to bring additional members. The more the support, the better for the Super Eagles,” Okumagba said.
