Southern Taraba (Jukun) youths in the Diaspora have urged Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State to stop neglecting traditional rulers. In a statement, yesterday, signed by Ezekiel Danjuma, the group expressed disappointment in the state government “for abandoning our fathers to the point of them going public seeking help against the Jukun tradition.” A committee had reportedly been set up to solicit funds for the burial of the Aku-Uka of Wukari, a first-class chief. But when the governor heard it, he stopped the committee, as the state has enough resources to give the late monarch a befitting burial. Citing the efforts put in place by previous administrations in the state to put smiles on the faces of monarchs across the state, the group alleged that the incumbent governor neglected the traditional institution.
