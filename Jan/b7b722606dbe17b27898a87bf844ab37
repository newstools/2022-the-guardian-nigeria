Group D table toppers, Super Eagles of Nigeria, will be aiming for another record in the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations when they file out against Guinea-Bissau this evening in Garoua, Cameroon. The host country, Cameroon, dropped two points on Monday when they were forced to a 1-1 draw by Cape Verde, leaving the Super Eagles as the only team in the tournament with the possibility of winning all three group matches if they beat Guinea-Bissau this evening. The Indomitable Lions of Cameroun finished top of their group with seven points. Interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, declared yesterday that the Eagles will ‘finish the job’ on a high note.
While the Super Eagles are topping the table with six points, Guinea-Bissau has one point. Eguavoen said at a pre-match conference yesterday that though he respects every team in the tournament, the Eagles will approach the game with all seriousness. “It is special topping the table. I did it in 2006 when I led the Super Eagles to Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations, and it will be great if we can do it here. I am not going to take the credit alone. “The level of this tournament is high, but it depends on the strategy you deploy into the game,” he said. Eguavoen said some of the players, who have not played any part in the competition so far will get the chance to show what they can do. Players like Daniel Akpeyi, Peter Olayinka, Henry Onyekuru, Francis Uzoho, John Noble, Tyronne Ebuehi, Frank Onyeka, Jamilu Collins and Olisa Ndah are yet to feature in the tournament. Eguavoen spoke on his relationship with the player, both former and present squad. “I am enjoying the support of players who played under me in the past, and I am also enjoying my working relationship with the present squad. But when it is time to bite, I bite. You have to give the young generation of players respect and demand for something from them in return. We are in the technology world.
