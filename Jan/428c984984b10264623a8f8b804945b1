Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says it has not commenced the sale of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) application documents. Fabian Benjamin, the spokesperson of JAMB, said in a statement, yesterday, that the attention of the Board was drawn to “the activities of unwholesome elements who had been misleading the general public on purported commencement of the sale of 2022 UTME and Direct Entry (DE) application documents. “For the avoidance of doubt, any information in circulation purporting to have emanated from the Board to the effect that sale of the 2022 UTME and DE forms has commenced, is not only fraudulent but is a calculated attempt by mischief makers to create unnecessary panic among prospective candidates for their own selfish ends.”
