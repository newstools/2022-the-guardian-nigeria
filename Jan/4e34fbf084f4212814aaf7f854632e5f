The Chairman-elect of a faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Prince Gboyega Famodun, yesterday berated the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, for publicly confirming his membership of a faction of the party that is opposed to Governor Gboyega Oyetola.
  
Aregbesola, a former governor of the state had, during the inauguration of a Digital Nigeria Centre (DNC), at the Muslim Grammar School, Ilesa, admitted that the party had broken into two factions, adding that he belongs to The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus that birthed the faction chaired by Rasaq Salinsile.
