The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has announced the appointment of Oritsedere Otubu as its new Chairman, to consolidate on its N11 billion monthly revenue.
   
Otubu replaced Charles Momoh who was the pioneer Chair and is stepping down after eight years in line with company’s policy and international best practices.
 
It is expected that Otubu will consolidate on the gains achieved under Momoh where monthly revenues climbed steadily from about N2.3b to nearly N11b.
