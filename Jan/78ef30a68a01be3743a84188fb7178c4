The Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) has increased the daily feeding allowance for inmates from N450 to N750. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of NCoS, Francis Enobore, disclosed this to journalists at the weekend in Abuja. According to Enobore, the current approved feeding allowance per inmate is N750, which is an increase from the previous N450. “The approved cost of feeding in NCoS is N750 from N450 per day. This is a significant improvement from what it was in the past and we want to use this opportunity to appreciate the Federal Government for this increase because custodial centres are meant for human beings and not for lesser beings. Just anybody can find themselves there; that is why we work to improve on the living conditions there,” he asserted.
