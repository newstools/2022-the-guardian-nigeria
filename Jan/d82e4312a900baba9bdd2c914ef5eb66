Analysts at Afrinvest said: “Next week, we expect the positive performance to be sustained as more investors take positions ahead of the dividend season.” Cordros Securities said: “In the near term, we believe positioning for 2021FY dividends will continue to support buying activities in the market even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the FI market. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “The market closed out the week strong as investors remained bullish on BUAFOODS.
