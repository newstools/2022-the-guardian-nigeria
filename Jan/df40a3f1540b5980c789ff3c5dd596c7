WACOT Rice Nigeria Limited, a subsidiary of Tropical General Investments (TGI) Group, has disclosed its ongoing expansion to double its 120,000-tonne rice mill in Argungu, Kebbi State, would be completed in the next 15 months.

WACOT Rice is currently doubling the capacity of the rice mill Vice President Yemi Osinbajo commissioned in 2017, a statement by the company said. The construction of the new rice mill is being carried out with support from First Bank Nigeria Limited. Gumel, who reiterated the company’s commitment to the economic development of Kebbi and Nigeria, said WACOT Rice would recruit and train more Kebbi indigenes once the project is completed. He applauded Bagudu for providing an enabling environment for the company to optimally thrive. Responding, the host commended WACOT Rice Limited for transforming the economic landscape of Kebbi. He said that the current expansion of the firm from its initial installed capacity of 120,000 metric tonnes to 240,000 metric tonnes was an indication of the tremendous confidence it had in the economy of Kebbi State and Nigeria. Governor Bagudu added that the company had confidence in the policies of the Federal Government especially as they relate to food production. The governor further noted that the company has made tremendous contributions to Kebbi state under its corporate social responsibility projects, including assisting over 300 women to participate in the rice value chain. “WACOT, in addition to doubling capacity, has been of tremendous assistance to Kebbi. It has supported the Argungu Fishing Festival and a lot of our other festivals; it has done a lot of corporate social responsibility. These efforts of WACOT are showing how much Nigeria has and more companies are following suit,” Bagudu added.
