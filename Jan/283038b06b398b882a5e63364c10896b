Nani has signed for Serie A team Venezia as a free agent after the former Manchester United and Portugal winger left Major League Soccer side Orlando City in November. In a statement released on Friday evening, Venezia said that the 35-year-old has “signed a contract which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2022/23 season”. Nani played 112 times for his country, winning Euro 2016, and over eight seasons as a United player won four Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League. He returns to Italy after spending the 2017-18 season on loan at Lazio from Valencia.
