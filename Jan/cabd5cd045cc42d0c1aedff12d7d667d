Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Muhammad Mamman Nami, has called on chairmen and commissioners of the Tax Appeals Tribunals (TAT) to devise appropriate mechanisms to achieve early and speedy resolution of tax disputes. Nami made the appeal, in Abuja, at the opening of a two-day retreat on the new Tax Appeal Tribunal (Procedure) Rules and e-Filing platform. He advised members of the tribunals to also pay attention to the public concern on the inconsistency in Order III (6) of the new TAT (Procedure) Rules and Paragraph 15(7) of the 5th Schedule to the FIRS (Establishment) Act to avoid litigations. “I commend the commissioners for contributing to the development of the tax jurisprudence through the delivery of sound judgments. From available reports, they have always exhibited a high level of commitment, probity and transparency in the discharge of their responsibilities. “I want to also use this medium to appreciate and thank the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, and all those who contributed to the development of the new TAT (Procedure Rules) and the e-filling platform. These two landmark achievements are expected to improve the efficiency of the tribunals for timely and quicker delivery of judgments, which in turn, will improve compliance and collection,” he said.
