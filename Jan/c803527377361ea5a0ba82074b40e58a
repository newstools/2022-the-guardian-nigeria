A day after the Super Eagles were eliminated from the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroun’s currency, the CFA, suffered a major blow in the exchange market. The exchange rate of the Cameroun francs had been high, maintaining equal rate (one-to-one) with Nigeria’s naira, since the arrival of the Super Eagles and thousands of Nigerians, including supporters club members, football administrators and sports journalists to the country. Outside the host country, Cameroun, there are more Nigerian journalists covering the AFCON than any other nation. The Guardian learnt that soon after the Super Eagles’ defeat by Tunisia on Sunday, the francs went down drastically.
