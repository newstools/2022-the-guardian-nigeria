The Kano State Government on Monday suspended the licenses of private schools over the murder of Hanifa Abubakar. Kano State Government said the schools’ licenses remained suspended until they are vetted. The Commissioner for Education Sanusi Said Kiru made the announcement during a press conference. “We are all aware of the ongoing case concerning Hanifa’s death as she was gruesomely murdered by a suspect called Abdulmalik Tanko who is the proprietor of Noble Kids Academy and in view of the sad incidence, especially regarding to how she was murdered in the private school, the State government has decided to withdraw the certificate of all private schools for revalidation,” Kiru said. The suspension comes days after the proprietor of Noble Kids School Abdulmalik Tanko confessed to killing five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar at his school. Tanko was arraigned him in court on Monday. The commissioner for education said a special committee would be set up to assess the schools and come up with measures to be used to approve licenses for private schools in the state. He also said that all schools that do not meet the new requirements will not be reopened.
