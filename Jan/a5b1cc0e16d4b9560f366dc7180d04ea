• Demands Release Of Igboho, Kanu The Aare Ona kakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Adams, has restated the need to restructure the country, even as he demanded the release of Sunday Adeniyi Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho and Nnamdi Kanu. Speaking during the commemoration of his fourth anniversary, as the 15th Aare Ona kakanfo of Yoruba land in Lagos, he said for Nigeria not to secede, “there is urgent need to restructure the country.” He compared Nigeria to a sick patient surviving on oxygen, adding that restructuring would promote excellence and lead to healthy competition among the regions. Adams said: “If we don’t want the country to split or be over-heated, we must go back to the basics, which is regionalism.” He expressed concern over insecurity in the country, stressing that Amotekun, to a large extent, had addressed insecurity in the Southwest. He appealed to the international community to return looted artifacts to the country. He said: “In the past four years, we have stood our grounds, rose above primordial sentiments to seek regionalism, as a better solution and approach to solve and address the various inequalities in power equation and the justice system in Nigeria. The country should be restructured.”
