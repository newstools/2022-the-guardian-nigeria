The National Pension Commission (PenCom) has called on all Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) to submit their 2022 media campaign plan on or before January 31, 2022. According to the directive posted on its website, the plan will provide details on sensitisation of more Nigerians about the scheme. PenCom, in a framework for enlightenment and public awareness for the micro pension plan sent to all pension fund administrators in August, said the directive was in line with Section 2.2 of the Circular on Service Delivery by pension fund administrators (PFA). The regulator also stated that PFAs are to develop yearly media campaign plans for MPP on or before January 31 of each year.
 PenCom noted that sequel to the release of the guidelines for the MPP, it identified the need to intensify public enlightenment in a sustained manner to raise the level of awareness and acceptability of the MPP as a critical success factor. It maintained that the framework spelt out the modalities for the Commission and PFAs to ensure effective and sustained awareness drive of the MPP.
