Nigerians across the country have praised MTN for its efforts towards providing for them an incredible Nations Cup experience.
 
MTN Nigeria, the official communications partner of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), went into partnerships with 140 viewing centres across the country in a bid to excite fans about Africa’s biggest football tournament. Viewers have been given opportunity to watch the game of life and cart home exciting prizes such as phones, irons and t-shirts among others. 
 
Chukwudi from Sokoto, who won a standing fan at one of the fan parks for his prediction of the Nigeria match, heaped praise on the telco. “I predicted the Nigeria match and MTN gave me this fan, thank you MTN,” he enthused.  “We are aware of the passion Nigerians have for football… we want to reward them for that passion because they push the team to achieve more. We are proud supporters of Nigerian football and we want to reward everyone who belongs in that community.”
 
The firm has also announced that it will be rewarding fans with an all-expense paid trip to watch the final match of the ongoing 2021 AFCON tournament in Cameroun. Interested MTN subscribers can simply dial *205# on their phones to get started. Successful subscribers will be informed subsequently.
