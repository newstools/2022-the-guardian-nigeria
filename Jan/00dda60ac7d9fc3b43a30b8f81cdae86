The inescapable nursery rhyme is most loved by children and often chanted along by their parents. Its 10 billion-view milestone comes after “Baby Shark” set a record in November 2020 to be the most viewed on YouTube. Baby Shark by PinkFong | Image: Youtube The creative mind behind the children’s song is a South Korean educational company Pinkfong, and it was performed by Korean-American singer Hope Segoine. It made its debut in 2016, becoming a viral hit in Asia, but only gained Americans’ collective consciousness in 2019. Since then, it has been turned into a Nickelodeon Tv show, a cereal, a live show, and the rallying cry of the Washington Nationals throughout their World Series-winning season. In January 2019, the “Baby Shark” video made the Billboard Top 40 at the 32 spot, inspiring the Jamie Tartt chant on Apple TV+’s “Ted Lasso.” YouTube’s most-watched video depicts two real children demonstrating the “Baby Shark dance” while the titular animated shark and his family, including a moustachioed “Grandpa Shark” swim calmly and later aims to hunt the children. They fail at their attempt, and the children celebrate their safety while the sharks watch from afar, forks in fin. Pinkfong’s US CEO, Bin Jeong, reported that the success was accidental. In 2019, Jeong told the media that the company had not expected the clip to take off the way it did, saying, “the ones that make it, make it on their own.” In celebration of the “special milestone,” Pinkfong invited children all over the world to share their “Baby Shark Dance moments” with the company.
