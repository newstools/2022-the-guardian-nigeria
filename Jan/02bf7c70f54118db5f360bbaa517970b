Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has lamented that some public servants in the state have been trained in corruption. At the opening of the State Executive Council (SEC) meeting, yesterday, Mohammed said: “If you look at the generation of public servants we have today, they are those who have been tutored, who have been cultured with aspects of corruption, take and take from the system. “Even committee meetings, the way they are being done are not the way that are known to those of us that are from the federal system. Civil servants have taken alliances; if you don’t give money, they don’t move an inch. We are not used to it.” The governor said his administration made so many promises, not to deceive and delude anybody, but to do more. “We have done our best to rescue the state from this situation, which was appearing very hopeless; but I urge you to do more with little resources,” he told his team. Mohammed said that he was aware of some forces trying to penetrate the SEC “to make sure that, politically, we are divided by dropping ideas, dropping names and so on and so forth.” He warned them to beware of such people and remain focused. “I appreciate what you do and I think the people of Bauchi also appreciate what we are collectively doing. “We should, please, minimise all those things that divide us – those divisive tendencies, utterances and what have you. I hear some of them and I discard them because, as a leader, it is not everything that you react to. Certainly, as a governor, I have so many ears that I hear so many things,” the governor added.
