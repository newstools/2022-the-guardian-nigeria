Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF) President and Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, has condoled with the family of the late Kolawole Jacobson, a renowned golf icon in Nigeria. In a condolence message to the family, Runsewe described the late Jacobson as an accomplished Nigerian, a talented golfer and lover of children, who was passionately concerned about the grooming of young Nigerians in the game of golf. Runsewe noted that he made very remarkable contribution to the development of golf in Nigeria, a game he loved with passion. “He was an outstanding Nigeria known for his honesty, integrity and committed hard work,” the NGF president noted, lamenting that Jacobson would be missed for the several good things he stood for. Runsewe said in this moment of grief, the consolation should be that he slept in the Lord as a man of good conscience, and therefore, shall be received in heaven by God Almighty.
