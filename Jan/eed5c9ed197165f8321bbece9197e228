To demonstrate his love and support for the team, President Muhammadu Buhari, had a telephone conversation with players and officials of the Super Eagles yesterday morning before their Round of 16 match against the Carthage of Eagles of Tunisia in Garoua.
 
Since the commencement of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun, Buhari has made it a duty to send words of encouragement and appreciation to the team, particularly after each victory.
