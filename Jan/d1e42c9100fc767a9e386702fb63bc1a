Having beaten Burkina Faso 2-1 in Sunday’s opener, Cameroon face Ethiopia, who were beaten 1-0 by Cape Verde in their first outing. Cameroon will start the game as strong favourites against a side whose entire squad – bar Mohamed Messaoud and the injured Bekele – play in the domestic Ethiopian league. After that opening-day win, the Indomitable Lions are top of Group A and can confirm their place in the last 16 with a second victory. Cape Verde are also looking to secure a spot in the knockouts with victory over Burkina Faso. Julio Tavares grabbed the all-important winning goal to cap an impressive display as Cape Verde made it four wins from their last five matches.
