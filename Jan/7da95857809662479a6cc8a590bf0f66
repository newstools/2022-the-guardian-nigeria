Former Super Eagles coach, Christian Chukwu, has said that the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) decision to hand over the team to coach Augustine Eguaveon on interim capacity few weeks to the 2022 AFCON, might mar Nigeria’s chances of doing well in the tournament. The Cameroun 2022 AFCON will begin tomorrow. “Eguaveon was given the Super Eagles job very late,” he said. “I pray he works hard on his players to be well committed on the pitch. Despite the absence of some key players in the Super Eagles, I believe Nigeria still have quality players in the Super Eagles that can make a mark in Cameroun. “For the Super Eagles to get to the second round of the AFCON, they must beat Egypt in the opening game. Losing their opening game will not be good for Nigeria,” he said. For coach Chukwu,  Nigeria’s quest to be successful at the AFCON fully depends on the ability of Eguaveon to motivate his players to play with 100 percent commitment on match days. The ex-Harambee Stars of Kenya coach however called on Eguaveon to pick the best players to handle matches for the country at the Africa Cup of Nations to avoid the team not being bundled out early.
Chukwu implored the NFF to support the Super Eagles in every capacity in Cameroun.
