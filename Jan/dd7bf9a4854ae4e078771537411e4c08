A Professor of Biochemical Toxicologist Polycarp, Nnacheta Okafor has advised universities of agriculture to take the lead in spearheading cassava research.
 
The don, who spoke on the topic: “Metabolism Of Cassava Cyanide and Jim Jones Cyanide in Humans,” during the 52nd inaugural lecture of the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, said one of their research findings has shown that there is a novel way of producing cassava flakes (garri) with low glycemic index and residual cyanide and would thus serve as food for diabetic patients.
 
He said cassava still holds great potential in social and economic growth of Nigeria, being staple food for millions and contributing meaningfully to food security without compromising food safety.
