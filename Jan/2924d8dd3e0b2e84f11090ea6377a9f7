Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, who confirmed the arrest, said Mohammed was tracked to Ilorin, Kwara State, while his partner in crime, Kasali, was apprehended in FESTAC Town, Lagos.
 
Odumosu said exhibits used to commit the act have been recovered, stressing that the suspects would be charged to court.
Recall that the suspects stabbed the 46-year-old pastor to death on December 2 and fled the scene with his bag containing some money.  “Few hours before then, Farouk got a telephone call from his mother, urging him to come home quickly that she was sick. We were contemplating on how he would get money to take his mother to the hospital when the Pastor walked in with the bag containing money.
 
“We followed him upstairs, hit him with a plank, before stabbing him with a broken bottle in the neck. He fell down. We grabbed the bag and left the house.”
 
On his part, Mohammed, 15, said he lied to his parents that he was coming to Lagos for a show, being an upcoming Musician.
He said: “I lied to my mother that I would get at least N200,000 from the show. We are upcoming musicians. We have been in the industry for three years. When things were not going on as planned, we decided to do something else , to  invest in our music industry. “Our mission in Lagos was to look for where to perform. But that plan changed immediately when we saw the pastor with the bag containing money.”
