The Lagos State government has implored Nigerian youths not to see themselves as local champions, but global citizens that can compete favourably with their peers from any part of the world. 
 
The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr. Olusegun Dawodu, stated this while interacting with some youths ahead of a leadership and capacity building trip to Chicago. The government is sponsoring divisional youth ambassadors, and others to the training.  The commissioner explained that the participants have been trained at the 2021/2022 IBILE Youth Academy, as well as the Transformational Leadership Programmes, organised by the Ministry of Youth and Social Development, where they were taken through different leadership topics and tasks.
 
It would be recalled that Miss Funmilayo Akanni-Shelle, who represented Ikorodu Division emerged as the 2021/2022 State Youth Ambassador with other five divisional ambassadors.
