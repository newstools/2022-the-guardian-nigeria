In 2016, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) board member, Alhaji Ibrahim Gusau, was the leader of delegation when the Super Falcons captured the African Women’s Nations Cup title, beating host, Cameroun, in the final.
 
Again, Gusau, who is the Chairman of Chairmen on the board of NFF, has been saddled with the same responsibility; this time, as leader of Super Eagles delegation to the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations, Cameroun 2021.
 
Speaking with The Guardian yesterday during the team’s training session ahead of Wednesday’s last group match against Guinea Bissau, Gusau predicted that the Super Eagles will lift their fourth African title here, in the final on February 6.
 
Gusau said the sudden transformation of the Eagles by the Austin Eguavoen-led technical crew and the determination in the players not to disappoint Nigerians were pointers to his belief that they would win the trophy for Nigeria.
 
He said; “I am sure that if they continue to play the way they have played in the first two matches against Egypt and Sudan, they will win the tournament.”
  
He added that his winning aura in 2016 had not deserted him. Gusau also dismissed as untrue reports of non-payment of bonuses to the players, saying, “these type of reports are circulated by detractors who want to plant discord in the camp. It’s a lie. “In every tournament, we have qualifying bonus, which graduates as the tournament progresses. I think it is too early in the day for anyone to start talking about that. There is bonus for the group stage, bonus for last 16, and so on. And we have not even finished the group matches. Everyone in camp is happy. The players have remained focused and praying for better outings in the tournament.”
