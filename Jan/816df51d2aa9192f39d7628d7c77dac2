Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has mandated security agencies in the state to go after killers of three persons in Rafin Bauna, Bassa Local Council on Sunday. Lalong, who condemned the act yesterday, described the attack as yet another callous attempt by the enemies of peace to begin the new year with violence. He promised that his government would resist such attempts with all resources available to it. According to the governor, the security report available to him indicates that the victims were on their way from Dutsen Kura to Rafin Bauna when they were ambushed and killed. He charged security agencies to conduct a thorough investigation, fish out the assailants and bring them to justice, as the “government is more than ever committed to making life difficult for criminals.” The governor sympathised with the families of the victims and assured them that justice would be done. Meanwhile, the governor has warned kidnappers to leave Plateau, as anyone who is caught and convicted for kidnapping would face capital punishment. He was speaking at the Catholic Cathedral, Shendam, where he reassured the residents that government would increase its fight against crimes, especially kidnapping, which has become a greater threat to the peace and security of the citizens.
