Sen. Opeyemi Bamidele (APC-Ekiti), a gubernatorial aspirant in the just concluded All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election in Ekiti has assured his supporters that he is seeking redress for “the blatant abuse” of trust during the exercise. Bamidele who stated this in a statement in Abuja on Sunday lamented how the process was hijacked by those at the helm of affairs at the Ekiti chapter of APC. He said, “We are of course, taking immediate steps within the confines of our party’s constitution and the law to seek redress for this blatant abuse of trust and due process by the state actors. “It is public knowledge that no primary election took place on Thursday, Jan. 27 but yet, rather disappointedly, results were announced based on concocted and fictitious vote counts. “So while we are on this quest to seek an amicable resolution to this impasse, I urge all to remain calm and prayerful that justice and truth will prevail for the benefit of the people of Ekiti.”
