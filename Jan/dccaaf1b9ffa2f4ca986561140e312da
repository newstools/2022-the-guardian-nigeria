The automation of the national minimum wage will reduce politicisation and inflationary trends associated with a wage increase in Nigeria, National President of Association of Senior Civil Service of Nigeria (ASCSN), Dr Tommy Okon has said.
    
Speaking with The Guardian in Abuja, Okon argued that unnecessary politicization of the minimum wage negotiation tends to lead to increment in the prices of goods and services upon completion which erode the expected gain.  As the county approaches the 2023 general elections, the ASCSN boss insisted that it is a high time the old generation yielded the political space to the younger generation.
    
“The older generation should abide by the biblical position that old men shall dream dreams and young men shall see visions. They should allow young persons to come into power so that they can be driven by vision. Nigeria should have a President that can walk around construction sites to see things for himself. We need Ministers that are driven by knowledge and strong vision. Efficient leadership is anchored on availability, accessibility, acceptability and accountability. When we have this kind of leader, we will be operating a fear-factor system. Nigerians must see governance as a sacred place meant only for the prepared and ready individuals with impeccable credentials that can push the country towards the desired point,” he submitted.
