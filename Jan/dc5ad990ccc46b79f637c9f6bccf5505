B’Faso Dismiss Tunisia, Qualify Too
The Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, yesterday, defeated The Scorpions of Gambia 2-0 to progress into the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). Two second-half goals from hero, Karl Toko Ekambi (50th and 57th) in the match played at the Japoma Stadium in Douala, were all Cameroun needed to send the passionate home crowd into ecstasy. The host dominated the debutant in the first half of the encounter, with The Gambians providing no answer to the Cameroonians display and their eagerness to book a place into the semifinal of the AFCON. The hosts needed just five minutes of the second half to break through Fai’s cross, which found the head of Karl Toko Ekambi, who then directed a header past the right hand of Gaye to put the hosts in charge. The Gambians replied with three changes in the 56 minutes, but in the confusion of trying to sort out their formation, they conceded a second goal just a few moments later, as Martin Hongla got free down the left and provided a low cross for Toko Ekambi to fire home and made it 2-0. The victory by the Lions of Cameroon yesterday, have moved them a step closer to the dream of winning the AFCON on home soil. Cameroun will now face the winner between Egypt and Morocco, which meet later today in the quarterfinal clash. The semifinal fixture will hold in Yaounde on Wednesday.
