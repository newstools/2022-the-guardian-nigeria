• Olorunsogo, Alaoji, Geregu, Sapele, Omotosho, Ugheli plants hit
• Nigeria to cut metering gap by 50%, reduce tariff, presidency says
• Review of privatisation, liquidity crisis, experts canvass As President Muhammadu Buhari and stakeholders in the nation’s power sector deliberate on what becomes of electricity with the current administration winding down, attacks on gas pipelines are becoming a new normal leading to shutdown of power plants.
   
Although the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari, and other stakeholders are finding it hard to connect the intention of vandals of gas pipelines as it has no immediate pecuniary advantage to the vandals, prevailing realities have led to the shutdown of over seven power plants in less than two months.
   
Breach on the Trans-Forcardos Pipeline (TFP) had last month impacted key power plants including Olorunsogo, Omotosho, Sapele, Ihovbor, Geregu and Ughelli East Plant, just as vandals last week, hit the TotalEnergies pipeline, crippling the 504 megawatts Alaoji power plant.
   
Last month, Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) issued a notice of gas curtailment arising from the abysmal system pressure levels that must be managed to avoid collapse of the gas grid.  “The president had admitted that the power entities were sold by way of political patronage. We should undo what has been done. We may not need to revoke but revisit,” Oke stated.	 
   
Some investors had noted that the worsening exchange rate crisis in the country would drastically impede the sector as the Managing Director of Mainstream Energy Solution Limited, Lamu Audu, had earlier told The Guardian, that financial crisis in the country, especially the exchange, remained a great barrier to growth.
   
Like Audu, whose company had signed an agreement with the government to recover power generation capacity at Jebba and Kainji dams, Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) payments and calculations being made in naira while repayment to government is done in dollars meant more vulnerability for the sector.
