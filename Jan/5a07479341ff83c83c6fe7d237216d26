Collection begins Feb 1 Lagos State Government, yesterday, introduced a daily consolidated informal transport sector levy of N800 for commercial transporters, besides union dues of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN).  Special Adviser to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, said anyone caught collecting money at any park, besides union dues and the consolidated levy, should be reported to the police for prompt action. Fayinka, who cautioned transporters against paying any other levy, expressed hope that the initiative would ease burdens in terms of amount and mode of payment. Speaking on behalf of the unions, Chairman, NURTW, Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo, said the unions are in support of the move.
   
He, however, clarified that the consolidated levy does not include dues, which the unions would continue to collect.
