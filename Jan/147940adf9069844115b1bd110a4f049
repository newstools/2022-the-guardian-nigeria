Having improved by 4 points and scoring 70 out of 100 now places us first in Africa. This is a clear indication that small as we are, Seychelles is on the right path towards fighting corruption in our country. It further demonstrates the efforts of government and the hard work of some our key institutions such as the National Assembly through the Finance and Public Accounts Committee, the Judiciary, the police, the office of the Auditor General, the Anti-Corruption Commission and others. I wish to commend everyone involved for working tirelessly to ensure that as a country we set high standards of good governance, transparency and accountability. I firmly believe that Seychelles will continue to do much better. The Government remains committed and fully engaged in the task entrusted to us by the people in safeguarding and ensuring taxpayers contributions are are properly accounted for and spent wisely for the benefit of everyone.” said President Ramkalawan.
