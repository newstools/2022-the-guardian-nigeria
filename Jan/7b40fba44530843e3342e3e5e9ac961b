Smile is a song of promise, as the lyrics are a vow of love to a lover, promising to do all that will keep her smiling. In the video, 2Baba and his wife Annie Idibia string up feelings of love within as they publicly express their love for each other. We see the couple wearing white fondly smiling and embracing each other. He promises to keep making her smile and talks about how her smile sparks great feelings. Though the 2Baba dedicated the song to his wife, however, it is uncertain if the video is more for them than us; a public reaffirmation of their love that hit trying times last year. Recall that the couple in September of 2021, had an infidelity squabble that threatened their marriage. In a leaked WhatsApp audio message, that was posted on Instagram gossip site. Annie Idibia’s voice can be heard saying she would “ruin everything” about her marriage and family due to her husband’s infidelity and his family’s unkindness towards her. She discloses how 2Baba left the country under the pretence of going for a shoot. She said “His family doesn’t love me, they hate me, they have been giving me hell for ten years. Today, my husband packed his things, he lied to me that he was going to shoot but my husband is on his way to America, planned by himself, Efeomoefe, and Frankie.” Annie never denied the audio but took to social media to apologise to the Idibia’s and Macaulay’s families.
