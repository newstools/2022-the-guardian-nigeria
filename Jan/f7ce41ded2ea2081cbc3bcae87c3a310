Controversy is no stranger to Africa Cup of Nations, but the image of the continental tournament has been badly dented by last Wednesday’s bizarre event, where the centre referee ended and restarted a group match involving Mali and Tunisia. Both times, before the stipulated 90 minutes, with no consideration for stoppages and other incidentals. There are 24 referees, 31 assistant referees and eight VAR officials from 36 African countries involved in the ongoing AFCON in Cameroun. The list includes three Camerounians, who had participated in the 2020 African Nations Championship (CHAN).
 
In the match between Mali and Tunisia, Zambian referee, Janny Sikazwe, who earlier gave a penalty at either end and sent off a Malian player, blew the final whistle with 13 seconds of the 90 minutes remaining, not considering the several minutes of stoppage time that should have followed.  The Egyptians won the match 1-0 in controversial fashion after a late equaliser from Guinea-Bissau was chalked off by a video assistant referee (VAR) review. A volley by talisman, Mohamed Salah, in the 69th minute, from a chipped cross from Amr El Soleya, had given the seven-time winners the lead, before the controversy that surrounded the decision to rule out Mama Baldé’s supposed-equaliser eight minutes from time.
 
The winger had regained the ball while trying to get past Egyptian defender, Omar Kamal, in a scrappy challenge, before playing it on the outside of his foot and striking with a curling effort past the goalkeeper.
 
Egypt’s players protested the goal, before VAR controversially ruled, deeming the coming-together between Baldé and Kamal as a foul by the Guinea-Bissau player. Egypt will face Sudan today with the hope of getting a victory to seal their spot in the last 16.
