The Guardian learned that a government gazette announcing the declaration was signed on November 29, 2021, days after the court order. “A notice is hereby given that the order of the federal high court Abuja, in suit number FHC/ABJ/C’S/1370/2021 dated 2021as per the scheduled to this notice the activities of Yan Bindiga group, Yan Ta’adda Group and other similar groups in Nigeria are declared to be terrorism and illegal in any part of Nigeria, especially in the Northwest and north-central regions of Nigeria and are proscribed, pursuant to section 1 and 2 of Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011,” the gazette reads in part. “Consequently, the general public is hereby warned that any person or group of persons participating in any manner whatsoever in any form of activities involving  or concerning the prosecution of the collective intention or otherwise of the groups referred to in paragraph 1 of this notice  will be violating the provision of the Terrorism (Prevention) Act 2011 and liable to prosecution.” The court, in a ruling delivered by Justice Taiwo Taiwo on November 26, held that activities of Yan Bindiga and Yan Ta’adda bandit groups constituted acts of terrorism in the country.
