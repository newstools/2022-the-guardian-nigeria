Owners of Olashore International School (OIS), a private boarding secondary school in Iloko-Ijesha, Osun State, have set up a panel to look into an alleged sexual assault claim by an ex-student Obiamaka Azubuike. Azubuike was a student of the school between 2004 and 2008. In a letter she published on social media in December 2021, the former OIS student said she was beaten and molested by 13 male students and that she escaped into the school principal’s house. Azubuike said the school authorities did little to punish her abusers because one of them was a son of a traditional ruler. She said the school authorities instead punished her for speaking out. “I was punished for talking about being sexually assaulted,” Azubuike said in the letter. “I was also banned from PROM and the Valedictory service. The girl that was with me that night but escaped being assaulted was also given the same punishment I was given,” she added. The Trustees of Olashore International School Association who owned the school said in a statement signed by Olapeju Sofowora, the chairperson of Olashore International School Association, on Tuesday that the panel will “commence sitting immediately and conclude their inquiry within 8 weeks.” The panel will be chaired by Olusola William, a retired Lagos High Court justice. Other members are Dr Alero Roberts, a lecturer and public health consultant, Adeyinka Adefope, an educationist and safeguarding consultant, Dr Sade Olajubu, a forensic psychiatrist and Ebuka Ekeanyanwu, a legal practitioner.
