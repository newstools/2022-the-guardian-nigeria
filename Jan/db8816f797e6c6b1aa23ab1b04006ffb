The former Executive Chairman, Lagos State Universal Basic Education Board (LASUBEB), Dr. Oluremi Ganiyu Sopeyin, has blamed scant planning for the failure of education policies and programmes to achieve set objectives, despite the deployment of huge sums in their execution. Speaking on the topic, “Effectively Setting Implementation Plans for Basic Education Administration in Lagos State: Getting Things Done,” at a two-day training for education secretaries in 20 local councils, Sopeyin maintained that it is not enough to have a goal, as concerted efforts must be put into adequate planning if the goal must be achieved. At the training, which was by Human Development Initiatives (HDI), he stressed that adequate planning include ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are part of the planning process, describing as unfortunate, the fact that in most educational planning processes, not up to 50 per cent of the relevant stakeholders participate, noting it is why most programmes either completely fail, or fail to achieve its set objectives. He cautioned that no matter the allocation to the education sector, it cannot be enough to address all the challenges hence the importance of adequate planning. Commenting on the capacity building training, the Executive Director of HDI, Mrs. Olufunso Owasanoye, said that “since the education executive secretaries are heads at the local councils, which is the foundation level of education that is very important to the entire education system, we felt there was need to re-orientate them on how they can make existing and future plans around basic education effective.”
