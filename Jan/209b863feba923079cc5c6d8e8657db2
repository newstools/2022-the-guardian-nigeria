The maiden Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) tagged: “Face-off Fight Night” will debut at the Grand Africa Ballroom, Lagos Continental Hotel, on Friday. The inaugural edition, which will witness five bouts among 10 professional fighters, is being organised by an African-oriented Nigeria MMA professional promotion company, 5Five 4Four (54) Limited and powered by the UFC Welterweight World Champion, Kamaru Usman. The clashes will feature Damilare ‘Ring Beast’ Addulrahimb against Ugochukwu ‘Nicotine’ Melvin, while Jude ‘Hurricane’ Ezugwu will lug it out with Richard ‘Resident Ninja’ Chidi Nwankwo, as Emmanuel Onoja contends with Richard ‘Shield’ Muzaan. Daniel ‘Big Shark’ Emeka engage in a brawl against Ayivor ‘Finisher Mawuko. Speaking on the partnership, Usman said the introduction of MMA in the country was to create opportunities for the youth that are interested in the sport. “It is quite often that when someone gets to a position of power they want to help. But the difficult aspect is how to help. You can’t just become the best fighter in the world and then decide to open a swimming school everywhere in Africa and expect it to work when I don’t know anything about swimming.” “At first, I thought about it over and over on how I can help, and how I can create opportunities for more youths like myself. Luckily, I was able to run into these amazing partners, which was the best way to go to achieve the vision and what we eventually plan to do,” he said. Also speaking, the Executive Chairman, Lagos State Sports Commission, Sola Aiyepeku, stated that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was interested in the sport and as much as in others sports. “There is no doubt that Mr. Governor loves sports and he understands the power of sports; the influence and impact it can make to our environment. I was excited when I heard about the partnership between Usman and the 54 Limited, which is to provide the platform for other Nigerians, who feel they can take on the sport,” he stated.
