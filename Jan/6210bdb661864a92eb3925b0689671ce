Indications emerged yesterday that the National Assembly might reconsider President Muhammadu Buhari’s position on the mode of selection of candidates vying for various elective seats in the country. The Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Michael Opeyemi, maintained that the National Assembly would liaise with the executive arm to bequeath to Nigerians an electoral act that would guarantee a free and fair election in the country. Speaking to reporters after submitting his expression of interest and nomination forms for the Ekiti governorship poll at the All Progressives Congress (APC) national secretariat, Abuja, he assured that an amicable resolution would be reached on the Electoral Act. Expressed preference for the direct primary, Opeyemi argued that it remained the most viable means of selecting candidates acceptable to party supporters. He, however, remarked that he would be left with no option than to abide by the decision of the party during the primaries. “You may not have a particular mode that will be acceptable to all aspirants at the same time and that is the essence of democracy, and that is why the constitution of the party provides for three different modes of conducting primary election. “One is the direct primary mode. The second is indirect primary and the third is consensus. It is up to the leadership of the party. But for me, definitely it cannot be consensus. I don’t see that happening,” he said.
