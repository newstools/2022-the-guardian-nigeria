The Dami Duro singer who called out his cousin yesterday for competing against his uncle Ademola Adeleke in the Osun State gubernatorial election has accused Bamidele of disrespecting his mom. Taking to Twitter, Davido “Because of your ambition you have your people write about me (which I don’t care ) but to include the death of my mother in an article …” “same woman that raised you … @deleadeleke001 ok na .. Dele God will reward you.” Accusing Bamidele of biting the hands that fed him, he tweeted again “The truth hurt you that much you had to go that low to mention YOUR AUNTY VERO that cared for you .. well .. I don open my crase for the year @deleadeleke001 stay tuned. NEW MUSIC 2MORO!” “Worst of all this Nigga really doing all this from the house my father gave you ! Audacity ! Disrespect me ! (I don’t care) But my FATHER my MOTHER Never! DELE I WILL STRESS YOU ! We go meet for field ….” he continued. Yesterday, Davido shared a picture of his cousin posing with a provisional clearance certificate for the Osun State gubernatorial election accusing him of “forming intellectual.” He wrote, “Wonderful! I finished university with a 2:1. But it’s now cousin Dele who struggled to even get a 2:2 that is now forming ‘intellectual’.” “Intellectual that has not succeeded in building one single thing in his own life on his own. This life ehn! Osun beware of FAKES. @deleadeleke001” “Bad belle lopo laiye Kehinde Le je oju taiye,” he continued.
