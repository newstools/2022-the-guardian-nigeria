The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied widely plots to suspend its national convention billed for next month. The caretaker secretary, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, in a statement, insisted that there was no iota of truth in the story. The scribe enjoined the public to completely disregard what it termed as “fake news on the issue by some media outlets.” APC maintained that those behind the news were bent on causing confusion and fomenting crisis in the party through misinformation. The party stated that dates for meetings, primaries, congresses and national conventions would be communicated through well-known official channels and not through ‘sources’ in due course. It added: “As a focus-driven, process-oriented political party, the APC Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Governor Mai Mala Buni, will not be distracted by self-serving antics of these sponsors of fake news. “The APC Caretaker Committee is already embarking on nationwide consultations with stakeholders to prepare the ground for a rancour-free national convention. To this end, the sub-committee on budgeting and other substructures will be set up in due course.” APC added: “The party, thereby, expressed appreciation for the continued support of well-meaning members and leaders as the caretaker committee undertakes the immediate task of addressing contestations within the party, litigations, fallouts of recently-conducted congresses and generally, reposition the party ahead of the national convention.”
