Less than 48 hours after the report of Hanifa Abubakar, who was kidnapped and later killed by her teacher in Kano, went viral across the country, residents of Zaria, in Kaduna State, were also thrown into mourning over the murder of an eight-year-old Asma’u, who was allegedly kidnapped and later killed by her neighbour. Asmau spent 42 days in the kidnappers’ den, having been allegedly kidnapped by one of her neighbours on December 9, 2021. Her father, Alhaji Shuaibu Wa’alamu, narrated to The Guardian, at the weekend, how she was abducted. He said: “My daughter was abducted on December 9. When she failed to return home, I lodged a formal complaint with the police. “After some days, the abductors began to call my number and demanded for N15m as ransom. But, we negotiated and I first gave them N2m. “They collected the money in Rigasa area of Kaduna. Later, they called me again and demanded for another N1.045m, as the only condition to release her. “I did not argue. I gave the money to them.
However, after paying the ransom, as demanded on January 19, they called me to tell me they had killed her and switched off the phone. “ I did their biddings because of fear of losing her. Now, they have killed her…” Meanwhile, efforts by The Guardian to reach the Police spokesman, ASP Mohammed Jalige for comments, were not successful.
