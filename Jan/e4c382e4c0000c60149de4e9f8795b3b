The event was planned to take place at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles with “The Daily Show’s” Trevor Noah as host once again. “Given the uncertainty surrounding the Omicron variant, holding the show on January 31 simply contains too many risks. We look forward to celebrating Music’s Biggest Night® on a future date, which will be announced soon,” the companies added. Last year’s Grammy Awards was also postponed from January to March, also due to a surge in Covid-19 cases. The event finally took place, largely outside, at the Los Angeles Convention Center with a smaller in-person audience.
