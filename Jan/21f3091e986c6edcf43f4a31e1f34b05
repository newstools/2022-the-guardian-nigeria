The Political Adviser to the President, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, yesterday, urged Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to conduct free, fair and credible primary that can produce popular candidate that would defeat candidate of other parties in the June 18 Ekiti State governorship election. Ojudu noted that the only way the APC can be proud of itself as a ruling party in the state and win the June 18 election with ease is to conduct credible primary that is devoid of violence and bloodshed. The presidential aide said this in Ado-Ekiti during an interaction with newsmen on the January 27 APC primary to elect the party’s governorship flag bearer. “I want to appeal to party men to be civil and peaceful. The only glory we can record in our party is to be peaceful and for our leaders from Abuja to conduct a primary we can all be proud of. Don’t let us be violent just because of internal election. “Primary of any party should be a day of celebration of democracy and not a day of bloodshed. We should be able to do this election without rancour. I am of that belief that politicians who want to use money to hire thugs to win election should rather use such money for development of our unemployed youth. Our party officials should be fair and transparent. They should also be efficient with the process
