 Kim Kardashian | Complex Reality TV star Kim Kardashian has unfollowed Miley Cyrus on Instagram just after the singer’s live New Year’s Eve special with Pete Davidson.   Page Six reports that a Miley Cyrus fan account, @MileyEdition noted that the Kardashian was following Cyrus’ IG account on Dec. 10. This was the same day Page Six had reported that Cyrus went to Davidson’s condo following their “Tonight Show” appearance, and now the Skims founder was no longer listed as one of her followers. Many suppose this to signal a three-way drama among the trio after SNL comedian Davidson and Wrecking Ball singer Cyris co-hosted a New Year’s Eve special in Miami on Friday. Davidson joined Cyrus on stage during the special to perform a version of Will Smith’s Miami in a smooth show without any blips, excluding Cyrus’ minor wardrobe malfunction. Before their special, Cyrus had serenaded Davidson on The Tonight Show, singing, “It should have been me.” For some fans, the lyrics could have referred to 41-year-old Kardashian, whom Davidson has been dating since October 2021. While Davidson spent his New Year’s Eve celebrations live on television with Cyrus, Kim Kardashian celebrated the new year at her Los Angeles home with her kids. This week, the couple reunited to travel to the Bahamas together on a private jet. In November 2021, Davidson and Kim Kardashian were announced to be officially dating after being spotted on many dates together. Weeks later, the Kardashian filed to be declared legally single amid divorce proceedings with estranged husband, Kanye West.
