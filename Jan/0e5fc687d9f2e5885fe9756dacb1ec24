A few days after a deadly stampede at Olembe Stadium in Yaounde killed about eight fans, some activists/lawyers in Cameroun are set for legal battle with the Confederation of African Football (CAF). Eight people were said to have died instantly during the stampede, which occurred during the round of 16 match between the hosts, Indomitable Lions of Cameroun and debutants, Comoros. The Guardian learnt, yesterday, that the activists/lawyers are holding CAF responsible for the death of the fans, as well as those injured during the stampede. “CAF should be held responsible for the death of our dear country men and women during the stampede,” one of the activists said. ‘We will pursue this matter till the end because the Africa Cup of Nations is CAF’s property, and they should take responsibility for everything.” CAF President, Patrice Mosepe, had accused the host country, Cameroun, of failing to do the needful a day after the deadly stampede, claiming that the duty of CAF is to advise on certain issues, including security.
