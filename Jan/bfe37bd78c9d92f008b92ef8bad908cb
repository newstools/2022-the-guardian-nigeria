Olumide and Stephanie Aderinokun Foundation has extended its interest-free loans to people in Abeokuta South and Abeokuta North local councils of Ogun State. The philanthropic gesture is part of the efforts of the foundation to assist businesses and reduce the effects of the harsh economic conditions on residents of Ogun Central Senatorial District. Two hundred people were given cheques of various amounts at the Foundation’s office last Wednesday, which they are expected to refund within six months with no interest added. The foundation also distributed free motorcycles to youths to help them have a source of livelihood amid the increasing rate of unemployment. Akinruyiwa of Owu Kingdom and co-founder of the foundation, Chief Olumide Aderinokun, was present at the ceremony. Also in attendance were Asiwaju Leragun of Egbaland, Chief Toyin Amuzu and Semiu Sodipo, among other state and local council leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
