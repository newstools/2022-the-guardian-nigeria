National Senior Citizens Centre (NSCC) has called on state governments to domesticate the National Policy on Ageing. Director-General of the centre, Dr. Emem Omokaro, who made the call in a statement made available to newsmen in Calabar, yesterday, also called for the adoption of the National Senior Citizens Act 2017 towards giving senior citizens adequate attention. The statement, signed by the Head, Public Affairs, Media and Communication, Mr. Omini Oden, described the state of senior citizens as not encouraging. Omokaro said there was the urgent need for the state government to domesticate the National Policy on Ageing as well as adopt the National Senior Citizens Act 2017 to give senior citizens in the state good attention. She said the National Senior Citizens Centre would collaborate with the Ekiti Council of Elders and the state government in developing intergenerational synergies that would leave legacies. The DG informed the body of senior citizens that President Muhammadu Buhari, during the first presidential summit on ageing in Nigeria, declared October 5 as National Day of Older Persons in Nigeria and mandated NSCC to commence the registration of senior citizens in Nigeria. The statement said the DG of the centre was in Ado Ekiti, capital of Ekiti State during a town hall meeting organised by the Ekiti Council of Elders in collaboration with the Nigerian Union of Pensioners, Ekiti State chapter.
