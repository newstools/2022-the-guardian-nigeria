Download logo The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TÄ°KA) carried out the project “Developing the Fishing Industry through providing of Outboard Boat Engines for Fishing Boats” in Lamu County of Kenya, which consists of many islands along the Indian Ocean, and where fishing is one of the main sources of income for the people of the region.  Within the scope of the project carried out together with the Kikozi Non-Governmental Organization, which carries out development, environment, health and income generating projects, the fishermen in the region were supported with equipment which would increase their product efficiency and product diversity. With the project, offshore fishery was supported by supplying 10 boat engines to 10 wooden boats belonging to fishing groups located on various islands of Lamu County. The project aims to support fishermen in the region who were initially renting a motor from other people or using dhows for deep-sea fishing, to increase their product variety through easier and less riskier access to the deep sea. In addition to around 70 fishermen who will directly benefit from the project, the local people will also benefit from the abundance of seafood provided by the project. The project also supports the objectives of developing fisheries-related infrastructure, strengthening monitoring, control and exploration systems envisioned in the Kenya 2030 vision, and also provides a modern solution to increase the capacity of the fishing sector in Lamu.
