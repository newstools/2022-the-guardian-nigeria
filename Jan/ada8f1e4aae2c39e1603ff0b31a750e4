The joint EU-UN Spotlight Initiative has trained and economically empowered 150 Gender-Based Violence survivors in vocational training on culinary arts, fashion design, make-up, event planning, decoration, and baking.
 
While 80 of the women were trained in Abuja, 70 were trained in Lagos. The beneficiaries drawn from Lagos had a graduation ceremony last week, where they showed part of the skills they were taught. 
  
At the ceremony, all the beneficiaries got working tools to aid their operations. The graduation ceremony is an output of the livelihood pathway programme in marking the 16 Days of Activism, which places strong emphasis on human rights, and the need to empower women and girls to be independent economically.  Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, Mrs Lydia Olabisi Oshioke, thanked FRED and their sponsors for helping to train and equip her with all that she needed to be a baker. She said they were not just trained for free, for the three months she was trained, the daily transport from her house to the training school was provided.
 
She pledged on behalf of others that they will make good use of the opportunity provided to them.
