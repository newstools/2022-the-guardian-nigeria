The Yoruba World Centre in collaboration with the Institute of African Studies and the Yoruba Language Centre of the University of Ibadan has organised an evening of Yoruba Poems and Drums in honour of Emeritus Professor Ayo Bamgbose, who turns 90 on January 27, 2022. The event is aimed at appreciating his contributions to the development of Yoruba Language and African Linguistics. Coordinator of the Centre, Alao Adedayo, said: “Part of the programmes of the Yoruba World Centre is to occasionally celebrate a very important personalities of Yoruba extraction by representing our arts: music, poems, talking drums and others to members of the public, especially the young ones and the elite.” “We hope that through this effort, the younger generation will learn and understand our recent past and be motivated to achieve the greatest heights in life. “It is also for the elite to develop an interest in promoting and supporting such arts to create jobs and empower the younger ones and a source of primary data for further research and education on Yoruba history, arts and culture,” he said.
