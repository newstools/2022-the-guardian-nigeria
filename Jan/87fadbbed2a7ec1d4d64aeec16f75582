President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the Super Eagles of Nigeria for an impressive start at the ongoing 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon, where they defeated a formidable opponent, Egypt 1-0, in their group stage encounter. The President noted, like millions of football-loving Nigerians, that the spectacular outing in Garoua, Cameroon, is a foretaste of what to expect from a dedicated team as they square up against other opponents in the tournament. He urged the Augustine Eguavoen-led team and the coaching staff to keep their eyes on the ball, remain good ambassadors of Nigeria on and off the field, and give loyal fans and all Nigerians more exciting moments to celebrate. Buhari assured the team of his unflinching support as they soar to write another chapter in the annals of Nigeria’s rich football history.
