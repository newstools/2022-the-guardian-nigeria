• Lauds Abiodun’s leadership, projects President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, inaugurated five projects in Ogun State, assuring that two major federal highways under construction– Sagamu-Benin and Lagos-Ibadan–will be commissioned this year. Buhari praised Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun for delivering visionary leadership and trail-blazing projects to the people, even in the midst of challenging circumstances occasioned by the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). Describing Abiodun as the ‘Performing Governor of Nigeria’s Gateway State’, the President tagged him a worthy example of “promises made, promises kept.” Buhari noted that the Gateway City Gate, the 42km Sagamu Interchange/Abeokuta Road, the 14km Ijebu-Ode/Epe Expressway and two housing estates for low, medium and high-income earners at Kobape and Oke-Mosan respectively, could not have materialised without the government’s commitment to security of lives and property. “This has made Ogun one of the safest and most peaceful states in the country and investors’ destination of choice. “You (Abiodun) have justified the mandate of the people of Ogun. You have represented our party very well,” the President said. He expressed delight that the 14km Ijebu-Ode-Mojoda-Epe road he commissioned was reconstructed into a modern expressway by the state government. The impressive road will complement the Sagamu/Benin Expressway that the Federal Government is currently reconstructing, also due for commissioning this year, he added. His words: “It is significant to note that the two road projects commissioned today are federal roads. This is an example of constructive engagement, cooperation and collaboration between the states and Federal Government. “These roads also fit well into our rail transportation master plan that connects Lagos, Nigeria’s economic capital, to Kano, with Ogun having more rail stations, along the Lagos-Ibadan rail corridor.” On the housing programme, the President commended its inclusiveness, saying it is equally heart-warming that captured the low, medium and high-income earners. Further on the Gateway City Gate Project, Buhari said: “It is not just a park beautification project. It depicts that something new is happening in Ogun, a welcoming entrance into the state capital at the centre point of the state.” He described the project as an icon depicting the joining of hands for building the future of Ogun in togetherness. Responding to requests by the state governor to give priority to the Lagos-Ota-Abeokuta and the Sango Ota-Idiroko roads, the President assured the people of Ogun that the roads would receive Federal Government’s attention. He announced that the Federal Government would consider extending tax credit as funding option for the reconstruction of the roads, as done for the 100km Sagamu Interchange-Papalanto-Ilaro road.
