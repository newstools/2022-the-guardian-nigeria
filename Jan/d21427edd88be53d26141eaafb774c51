The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Rivers State Command, has paraded 17 suspected oil thieves.
The Guardian gathered that the NSCDC General Special Intelligence Squad (CGIS) in collaboration with the personnel of the state command arrested the suspects. Six trucks and a bus conveying the illegally refined products like kerosene and diesel were seized. The command’s spokesman, Mr. Akins Mike Oguntuase, told newsmen, yesterday, shortly after the parade at the command’s zonal head quarters along Olu Obasanjo Road, Port Harcourt, that the effort was geared towards checking vandalism of critical national assets, soot menace and infrastructure. Recalling that the command recently paraded some suspected oil thieves; Oguntuase said the fight against the menace is an ongoing task. He said the Chairman of Emohua Local Council, Dr. Chidi Lyold, handed two out of the six trucks over to the command for investigation and possible prosecutions. The Public Relations Officer, however, encouraged residents to collaborate with NSDC in the ongoing fight to bring the nefarious act to a stand still in the state.
