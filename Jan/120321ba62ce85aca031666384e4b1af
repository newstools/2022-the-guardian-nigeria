President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, expressed condolences to the family of the five-year-old school girl, Hanifa Abubakar, whose body was discovered in a shallow grave in Kano after near two months of fruitless search. The President also commended the police and the secret service in unraveling the mystery behind the disappearance of Hanifa, and particularly for the arrest of her teacher and his other accomplices suspected of the child’s kidnap and murder. President Buhari said the family and the whole nation, which followed up on Hanifa’s travail since her disappearance last December, were hoping for the girl to have been rescued alive and well, adding however that the very thorough and painstaking detective operation by the law enforcement bodies, leading to the discovery of the corpse and the arrest of the suspects, who have already made confessions, was commendable. He commended the authorities, adding that the achievement should instill more public confidence in them. “When breakthroughs like this happen, people will talk differently of law enforcement,” the President said. President Buhari prayed for the repose of the soul of the little school girl, urging her parents to bear the sad loss with courage and fortitude in God. The President urged the police and Ministry of Justice to uphold the integrity of the detective work that busted the case by preparing well and presenting a good case that would earn the respect of the court.
