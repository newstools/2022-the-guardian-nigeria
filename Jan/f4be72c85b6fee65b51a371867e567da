The Mavin Record boss made this known via his social media page on Instagram after reiterating singer and songwriter, Simi’s stance on enhancing visibility and how new artistes do not make use of the tools provided by social media. The popular songstress advised that people should use their social media pages to grow their craft rather than send mysterious images. She wrote, “You’re a serious growing artist and you only have three posts on your page? A picture of the sunset, one of aeroplane and one with your shoe. Caption: Lost but don’t find me. Nothing with your music in it. That’s not a great look. If you want it bad bad, always sell yourself. Leave the mysterious shit for when you’ve won. Even then, leave it alone.” Posting Simi’s quote on his page, he wrote,  “I tell y’all this all the time. Hear it from your fellow artist too. All that fake deep mysterious aesthetic is tampering with your ops. Besides if you show the algorithm that you want to be dark, mysterious and left alone, it will make sure you are in the darkest part of the gram where no one will see you. How then will you get discovered?”
