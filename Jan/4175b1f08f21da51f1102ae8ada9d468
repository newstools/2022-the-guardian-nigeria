Lifts ban on motorcycles in Yobe North, South 
Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, has debunked media reports that the party plans to review congresses in Gombe State. A statement by his Director-General, Press and Media Affairs, Mamman Mohammed, in Gombe, yesterday, disclosed that the APC helmsman had, at no time, said or directed anyone to state on his behalf or that of the party, anything pertaining the said review. “The report is a baseless speculation and a figment of the author’s imagination that does not reflect, in any way, the position of the party. “It is pertinent to note that we have gone a long way in reconciling the two prominent members of the party in the person of Governor Muhammad Yahaya and Sen. Danjuma Goje,” the statement reads. Buni called on supporters of the governor and the senator to support the peace, reconciliation and brotherhood among the stakeholders. ALSO, Buni has lifted the ban on motorcycles in two senatorial districts of the state. According to him, the 10 councils in Yobe South and North senatorial districts where the ban was lifted comprise Fika, Fune, Nangere, Potiskum, Bade, Machina, Nguru, Jakusko, Karasuwa and Yusufari. Special Adviser on Security Affairs to the Governor, Brig-Gen. Dahiru Abdulsalam (rtd), disclosed, yesterday, in Damaturu that Buni approved the lifting of ban on motorcycles in the 10 local councils. He said that motorcycle operators in the state were to ply their respective routes between 6am and 6pm daily but not for commercial purposes. “There will be no carrying of passengers on motorbikes. There should be proper registration, licensing and documentation of all motorcycles and their owners by the Yobe State Road Traffic Management Agency (YOROTA),” Abdulsalam stated. He urged security operatives to monitor movement of motorcyclists and ensure strict compliance to traffic rules and regulations.
