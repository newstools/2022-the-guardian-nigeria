The Lagos State government has charged the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) to have a cordial relationship with leaders at all levels so as to facilitate the smooth discharge of its duties and responsibilities on Lagos roads.
   
The Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr. Wale Ahmed, who gave the charge when the Lagos State Sector Command paid him a courtesy visit, encouraged members of the Corps to take advantage of relating with the leaders at the grassroots, who would in turn pass the safety message to their followers community members This, he explained, will help to change the peoples’ perception of their operations, and engender peaceful operations within the communities.  He, however, sought for greater cooperation from the grassroots to establish more station offices across the 20 local councils, saying, “this is necessary for database collation, public enlightenment, collaboration with sister agencies of the state during rescue operations to prevent road accidents, and other related emergencies.” 
 
Ogungbemide stated that a great synergy with the communities was needed to curb crashes and other road emergencies, noted that most crimes “start and end on the road, The FRSC owes it to give accounts of people and what comes into Lagos State.”
