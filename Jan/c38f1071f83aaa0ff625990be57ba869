Super Eagles Interim Coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has disclosed that he and the incoming national team manager, Jose Peseiro, are yet to meet at the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations. Speaking on a radio programme monitored at the weekend, Eguavoen disclosed that he is fully in control of the Super Eagles, adding that he is delighted that every player in the team is playing according to his instructions. Eguavoen revealed that every player in the Eagles camp is fit and ready to give his best in the team’s remaining matches. “If the Portuguese is present in the city, I don’t know yet because nobody has told me. But that notwithstanding, the Eagles are fully focused on the AFCON. I have talked to the players to take every game as the final of the AFCON. “I am excited that the players are intelligent and smart to understand what I want them to do on the pitch… this makes my work easy. My target is to win the AFCON, but every game must be approached seriously by the team to achieve the feat,” he said.
