Barring any unforeseen circumstance, the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will hold before the end February as scheduled. According to a top member of the party, who preferred anonymity, the convention may hold on February 25, 2022. The source, who spoke with The Guardian in Abuja, said: “I can tell you now that our national convention will hold by February 25th here in Abuja; that has been confirmed by the National Caretaker Committee. “The Buni-led leadership is not against those that were calling for the convention in February but the leadership wanted a situation where the house will not be too divided against itself during the national convention. “If some of the life-threatening crises rocking the party are not amicably resolved, it will further polarise the party even after the convention and we have to bear it in mind that after this exercise (convention) we will face with the general elections.” The final decision on the February date is coming against the backdrop of calls for the sack of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee over allegations that it was hell bent on holding on to the seats to score political goals. The decision is in tandem with the position of President Muhammadu Buhari and other key stakeholders of the party.
