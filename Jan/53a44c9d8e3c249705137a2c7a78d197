Fassianos, whose works have been showcased around the world, including paintings, lithographs, ceramics, and tapestries, was forced to put down his painting brush in 2019 due to his deteriorating health, which had him bedridden at his home in the suburbs of Athens for several months. He died in his sleep, Viktoria Fassianou, his daughter said. His admiration of the legendary Matisse and Pablo Picasso has led experts and admires to refer to him as the modern-day version of these artists, a comparison he resisted, insisting he had drawn on different influences.
Fassiano moved between Greece and France, where he studied lithography at the National School of Fine Arts in Paris. The website devoted to his work says his style was forged in the 1960s and that his main themes have always been man, nature, and the environment. In tribute to Fassiano, an Athens museum devoted to his work will open in autumn 2022 and display some of the works that are currently decorated in his home. His friend and architect Kyriakos Krokos, redesigned the central Athens museum where his work will be exhibited.
France has awarded him some of its top awards, including the Legion of Honour (Arts and Letters) and he is also an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Arts.
