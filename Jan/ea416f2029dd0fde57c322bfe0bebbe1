The argument that state governors are not in charge of security in their various states was reinforced, yesterday, as a police officer refused to disengage from the Magodo estate operations or call his superiors at the order of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State.
   
In the hot exchange captured in a short video that has gone viral, the governor was seen directing the unidentified police officer, who said he is a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) to disengage from the assignment, which he (the governor) said was illegal, since he was not aware of the operations as the Chief Security Officer of the state.
   
The officer refused to disembark, explaining that he was there with his men at the orders of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) through the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF).
   
He also refused to give the governor the exact figure of officers in the operations, arguing that he cannot give out such information for security reasons.
