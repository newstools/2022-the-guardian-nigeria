As part of the health project implemented in cooperation with Jazeera University Hospital in Mogadishu, physicians treated patients who could not be treated with existing facilities, and shared their experience with local healthcare providers. A total of 353 examinations and 74 operations, most of which could not be performed under the existing conditions in Somalia, were performed within the scope of the health assistance activities carried out at Jazeera University Hospital through the university, which is a partner organization. At the university hospital, which serves local people mostly in the fields of orthopedics, gynecology, and pediatrics, simple operations can be performed by the hospital staff. Operations other than simple ones such as tonsil removal operations in the field of ENT and lipoma and hemorrhoid removal operations in the field of general surgery cannot be performed due to the lack of anesthetics and surgical equipment. As part of the project, which included the theoretical and applied training of specialists, assistants, nurses, and anesthetic technicians in the fields of general surgery and ENT, the necessary anesthesia machines, other equipment, and consumables were brought from Turkey and delivered to the hospital.
