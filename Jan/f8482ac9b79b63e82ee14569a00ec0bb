Senator Olubunmi Adetumbi of All Progressives Congress (APC), representing Ekiti North, has declared that he deployed his network and hard work to attract N2 .4 billion worth of projects to the zone in the last two years. [FILES] Ekiti state  The Chairman, Senate Committee on National Planning, disclosed that the feat was achieved through personal sacrifice and intense networking with relevant Federal Government agencies to bring dividends of democracy to his constituents. Last month, the senator’s constituents had chided him, through the Justice Development and Peace Commission (JDPC), for alleged non-performance. Adetumbi, who lauded Governor Kayode Fayemi, traditional rulers and his constituents for their support, catalogued the projects he attracted to different parts of Ekiti North to include 20 solar-powered boreholes, seven road projects, three, six and 12-block classrooms in six select schools, among others.
