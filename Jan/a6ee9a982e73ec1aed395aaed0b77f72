• Global bodies partner local green techs, advocate shared infrastructure Over 70 per cent of Nigeria’s rural population are estimated to be farmers, about 70 per cent of its agricultural workforce is constituted by women and 88 per cent of Nigeria’s farmers are smallholders with fewer than two hectares of land, while about 40 per cent of Nigeria’s produce is lost and wasted due to poor storage facilities, transportation challenges and absence of an effective cold chain.
 
Following the yearly loss, about 25 per cent of smallholder farmers’ yearly income is lost to food deterioration. Worth of produce in monetary value estimated at $39.34 billion is lost and 76.9 million metric tonnes of produce are wasted yearly.  However, public storage infrastructures in Nigeria have been concessioned, and the remnants are mostly dysfunctional and without the capacity for cooling vegetables and fruits. Some of the reserves have been leased to private operators. The Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) approved the concession of 20 out of the 33 strategic grain reserves in 2018 and claimed to expect N6 billion in the 10-year lease period. The storage capacity of the silo complexes ranges from 11,000 to 100,000 metric tonnes with a combined total storage capacity of 1.3 million metric tonnes. The holding capacity breakdown of the 33-grain reserve silos are Jahun, Jigawa 25,000 metric tonnes (MTs); Kaduna, Kaduna 25,000 MTs; Gombe, Gombe 25,000 MTs; Jos, Plateau 25,000MTs; Minna; Niger 25,000 MTs; Ilorin, Kwara 25,000 MTs; Lafiaji, Kwara 11,000 MTs; Makurdi; Benue 25,000 MTs; Ibadan; Oyo 25,000 MTs; Akure; Ondo 25,000 MTs; and Irrua, Edo 25,000 MTs. Others are Ogoja, Cross-River 25,000 MTs; Ezillo, Ebonyi 25,000 MTs; Dutsin-man, Katsins 25,000MTs; Sokoto, Sokoto 25,000MTs; Bulasa, Kebbi 100,000MTs; Gwagwalada, FCT Abuja 100,000MTs; Ilesha, Osun 25,000; Gusau, Zamfara 100,000MTs; Gaya, Kano 25,000MTs; Yola, Adamawa 25,000MTs; Bauchi, Bauchi 25,000MTs; Jalingo, Taraba 25,000; Maidiguri, Borno 100,000; Lafia, Nasarawa 25,000; Ikenne, Ogun 25,000; Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti 100,000; Lokoja, Kogi 25,000; Igbariam, Anambra 25,000; Uyo, Akwa-Ibom, 25,000; Damaturu, Yobe 25,000; Yenagoa, Bayelsa 100,000; and Okigwe, Imo 100,000. Meanwhile, as part of solutions to the multifaceted challenges, the Basel Agency for Sustainable Agency (BASE) and the Swiss Federal Laboratory for Material Science and Technology (Empa), both in Switzerland, is currently developing an open-access data science-based mobile application, called, ‘Your Virtual Cold-chain Assistant (YVCCA),’ to enable smallholder farmers, aggregators and food traders to optimise their decisions on produce and farm management, and to gain access to sustainable private-sector operated cooling infrastructures. The project was launched in September for Nigeria. The expansion of the project is commissioned by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and is being carried out by BASE in partnership with Empa on behalf of the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) (GmbH). The project is the expansion of BASE and Empa’s efforts in India, which started in January, as part of the DataDotOrg Inclusive Growth and Recovery Challenge, piloted in partnership with The Rockefeller Foundation and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth. “With the use of business model innovation, digitalisation and data science, our interdisciplinary team is working in close collaboration with local entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in Nigeria to strengthen the agricultural cold chain and generate measurable environmental and social impact,” Thomas Motmans, Project Lead at BASE, said. Project lead at Empa, Dr. Daniel Onwude, said: “We are now gathering data and building the relevant models. The innovation aims to use a proactive and sustainable data science approach by upcycling the many data sources available in the food supply chain into ready-made information to save food and improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers in Nigeria.”  The app also predicts the current quality of the stored food. A computer-vision powered application would assess the quality of the produce at harvest that is being stored in the cooling facility. In addition, the BASE and Empa teams are planning to map relevant open-source data into an openly-accessible multi-layered map of Nigeria, accessible by anyone in the world without having to download the data. The map would be able to tell which location or states in Nigeria has the lowest shelf life gain with a very high cooling demand. This information will help different stakeholders in the fresh produce value chain, especially the government, take proactive measures to reduce food waste. The groups are closely collaborating with local cold service providers starting with Coldhubs, and exploring partnerships with other key local stakeholders such as Data Science Nigeria and InfraCredit.
 
The Guardian gathered that the project would be piloted in three states (two northern states and one in the south) based on the requirement of key local partners.
 
When fully developed, the app would be open source, meaning anyone, including the government, could key in and upscale to other states and other agricultural value chains.  The project team that traveled on the ground, composed of Dr. Roberta Evangelista and Thomas Motmans from BASE and Kanaha Shoji and Dr. Daniel Onwude from Empa, described the trip as being exceptionally insightful and dense, filled with learnings that were already being integrated into the design of the solution.  A more extensive description of the mission trip by the project team to Nigeria is available and more information about the project are available on the official project website www.yourvcca.org, which also includes a fact sheet of the project.
