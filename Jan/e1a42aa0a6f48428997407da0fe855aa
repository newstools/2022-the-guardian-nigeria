Former Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, has described cricket as a game capable of helping to instill discipline and critical life skills in the youth. He also sees the sport as a way of life that can help the country curb youth restiveness and other vices associated with idleness. Speaking when he joined Professor Osato Giwa-Osagie to commission the turf wicket of the Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval in Lagos on Sunday, Ambode added: “I think critical to success in any endeavor in life are the soft skills that the game of cricket teaches and we are very happy at the recent uptick in the development of the cricket. “This turf wicket compliments all the effort of the administration in growing the game and I believe we would in no time feel its impact.” The TBS Oval, the nation’s traditional home of cricket was shut for 18 months for upgrade from concrete bowling strips to grass, which has been one of the challenges facing the development of the sport in the country. Professor Giwa-Osagie, while commissioning the turf wicket, challenged cricketers and stakeholders to pull resources together to further the growth of the game. “I am glad at the level of development that this ground has undergone. This ground hold a lot of memories and mean much to the history of Nigeria and cricket.” Earlier, NCF President, Uyi Akpata, revealed that the facility upgrade has increased the number of top flight cricket grounds in the country to seven in just one year that the Federation commenced the project. “Facility upgrade scores very high on our agenda and the TBS is very critical in that sphere as it is Nigeria’s frontline facility,” he said.
