A lineup of Nigeria’s finest comedians is shutting down Benin city with the I Go Save Unsusal on January 2, 2022. As one of the biggest first shows in the year 2022, I Go Save said it is always refreshing to start the year with lots of laughter. According to the comedian born Otaghware Otas Onodjayeke, the reason for hosting the Igosave Unsusal in January is for people to start their year with laughter and much happiness. Now, the comedy show is referred to as one of the biggest events in the South. “People look up to it to kick start their year. I Go Save Unsusal has grown from just a show to a lifestyle as it plays host to Nigeria’s comedy champions and best musical acts,” he said. Comedians like Igodie, Gordons, Klint Da Drunk, Buchi, Kenny Blaq and many others are to take centre stage of the show; while musical performances are expected from Buju, AV, Erigga and a surprise guest artiste is expected to make the event a memorable one. Speaking further about taking the show to other started like Lagos, Port Harcourt, Abuja, Igosave stated that the year 2022 will be a busy year for the Igosave Unsusal comedy brand as they plan to take it to other cities and outside Nigeria. “Truth is I started organising I Go Save unusual in Benin City in 2009 and over the years I have gained a wealth of experience doing it. We will be having anI Go Save Unusual tour this year 2022 and this is to have granted the wishes of I Go Save Unusual fans. We have so far confirmed plans to host the show soon in Abuja, Lagos, Warri, Port Harcourt, Asaba for now. We are also making great plans for an Igosave Unusual campus tour before taking it global to USA and UK.

So, I can tell you that 2022 will be a very busy year for the I Go Save Unusual brand already.”
