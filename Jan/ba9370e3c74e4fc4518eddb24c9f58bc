The Women’s Technology Empowerment Centre (W.TEC), Lagos trained no fewer than 1,820 women and girls on technology programmes in 2021.
 
The centre’s Communication Officer, Yemi Odutola, made this known in an interview in Lagos. W.TEC is a Nigerian non-profit organisation focused on encouraging girls and women to pursue technology careers.
  
Odutola said that the training of women and girls was done through the centre’s technology after school clubs, camps and other programmes. He noted that the centre was able to train those numbers of girls through the various training programmes held last year.
 
 “Last year, we successfully launched our in-person ‘MakeHerspace’ training for participants in Nasarawa, Bauchi and Abuja after the passing of the second wave of the pandemic in Nigeria.
