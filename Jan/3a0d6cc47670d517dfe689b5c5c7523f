Delta State Chief Judge, Justice Theresa Diai, has asked magistrates in the state to conclude cases involving accused persons in prison custody within three months or be reprimanded. Diai dropped the hint at the conclusion of her three-day visit to Warri Custodial Centre, where nine inmates were released, expressing concern over the undue delay of dispensation of justice at magistrate courts. He, therefore, urged magistrates to assert themselves so that prosecutors and witnesses would sit up to do the needful to avoid unnecessarily delay in court proceedings. Diai, however, commended the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Ministry of Justice, the Police, Chief Registrar and his team for their diligence, efficiency and commitment during the visitation. She also applauded the prison authority for providing adequate medical care for inmates, noting that of the 471 awaiting trial cases reviewed, none was bedridden. Diai ordered for the treatment of one Alfred Omojade, who complained of a bullet in his leg. The Chief Judge, on the legal advice of the Director of Public Prosecution released two brothers, Wilson Ofigho and Bishop Basikoro, charged with offences of conspiracy, murder and arson.
