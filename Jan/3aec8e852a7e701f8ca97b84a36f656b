More displaced men and officers of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF), at Mini Okoro Police barracks in Obio-Akpor Local  Council of Rivers State have lamented their woes following the demolition of “illegal” houses on the orders of the Inspector General of Police (IGP).
   
The officer had staged a protest on Wednesday, demanding the State Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, to review the  eviction order, noting that the initial order was to dislodge occupants of shanty houses in the barracks and not well planned concrete structures. 
 
The Guardian gathered that the Paramount Ruler of Rumuobiakani community (the host community to the barracks),  Eze Temple Ejeku, while addressing the protesting officers advised them to allow the directive of the Inspector General of Police to go on.
  
Ejeku, who disclosed that he had had a meeting with the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the station and Area Commander, urged the policemen to, first of all, move out their properties from the houses, evict all civilians from the barracks while the community interface with the IGP to halt its decision.
 
Meanwhile, the Rivers State Police Command has said the action was based on the decision of the Police management team.
 
Acting Spokesperson of the command, Grace Iringe-Koko, who confirmed the development, said the police were on the move to retrieve their property from illegal occupants.
