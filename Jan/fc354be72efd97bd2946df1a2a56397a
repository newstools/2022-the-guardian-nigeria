As Nigerians navigate into the New Year, a major wish is to see improvement in telecommunications services across the board.
   
To a greater extent, in 2021, the poor state of telephony services in the country pitted subscribers against the operators, the quartet of MTN, Airtel, Globacom and 9mobile.  Pointing at the three leading players, MTN, Globacom and Airtel, subscribers said both voice and data services since the beginning of the year have been below par.
    
A customer of two of the operators, Israel Alebiosu, said the telecommunications industry in Nigeria has developed to be very competitive, as different telecoms companies jostle for the attention of subscribers.
    
He, however, said one of the key challenges confronting these companies is how they manage their service, which holds a great deal for customer satisfaction. He stressed that service quality and customer satisfaction are very essential in maintaining customer loyalty.
  
Narrating his ordeal, Alebiosu, who is Lagos-based, said: “I use both Glo and Airtel, but I prefer the latter because they give more bonuses and their service is good but when they want to be bad they will be. Glo network is bad these days! The network earlier in the year, removed my airtime when I had not finished using it and their data bundles do not last for long unlike before when they expire on stipulated date.”
  
According to him, all the operators must invest and expand their services this year, “we don’t want to be making calls and suddenly, the service is frozen or calls drop.”
