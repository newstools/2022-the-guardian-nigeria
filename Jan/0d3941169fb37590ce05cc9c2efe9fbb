Ekong, whose long-standing partnership with an absentee teammate, Leon Balogun, earned them the sobriquet ‘The Oyinbo Wall,’ assured that they would continue with the same level of optimism this evening.

Even under the previous coach, we were able to qualify for AFCON and got to the last stage of the World Cup playoff. “In football, you can’t guarantee a smooth sail all the time. We have a new coach, everybody is enjoying himself because there is a new air of freedom and we are allowed to express ourselves.” The Eagles defensive supremo said the team has enjoyed playing in Garoua and would not want to disappoint their fans. “We really are enjoying Garoua and its lush pitch. We are at home here.”
