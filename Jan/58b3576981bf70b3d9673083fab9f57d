Former Governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, has berated his successor, Hope Uzodimma, over his failure to name the alleged sponsors of insecurity in the state. Following rising insecurity in the state, Uzodimma had vowed to expose those behind banditry, but failed to do so at the stakeholders meeting at the Government House Owerri, citing security concerns and the fact that it would jeopardise the investigation of the menace in the state. Speaking to newsmen in Owerri, yesterday, Okorocha, who currently represents Imo West Senatorial District, described Uzodimma’s action as the highest level of inconsistency. He said since Uzodimma assumed office, Imo has been under bondage due to his inability to curb insecurity and provide good governance in the state. Okorocha, who also accused Uzodimma of being the architect of insecurity in the state, said he was ready to help in exposing perpetrators of killings, kidnappings and other atrocities in the state. “At this point, the world has to help Imo. The state is in bondage under Uzodimma’s government, as his government lies and deceives a lot. “Under this government, what is happening in Imo State is simply intimidation. It is simply killings and people are not speaking up, because they are scared. But, Uzodimma has bought his failure by desecrating the house of God,” he said.
