• Charges Citizens To Prepare To Vote ‘Evil’ Out National chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, has warned Nigerians against expecting anything good from the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led administration this year. In a New Year message he personally signed, Ayu charged Nigerians to mobilise “and get this evil out of their lives”. He stated that nothing good could come out of the administration, adding that, “they will still make your life nasty, brutish and short.” Ayu noted that it is hope that has kept Nigerians surviving in the last years, saying that: “It is very important that you continue to live by hope. Honestly, only hope has kept us going in the last six years. Otherwise, our lives have been a living hell under the so-called regime of ‘change’.” “Do not expect anything better from the APC in 2022. They will still make your life nasty, brutish and short,” he said. The PDP chairman, however, said that the good news is that all bad things come to an end. “The hell that is APC will surely come to an end. Go out and register. Get your voter’s card; mobilise and get this evil out of your lives. This is why 2022 is such an important year of hope for all Nigerians,” Ayu stressed.
