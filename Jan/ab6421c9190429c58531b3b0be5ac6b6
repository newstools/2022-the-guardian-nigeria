Lagos State Government has charged the State Council on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) to create and drive programmes that would enhance the capacities of MSMEs to deliver on their mandate. 
 
Addressing members of the MSMEs in Ikeja at quarterly council meeting, the Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Dr. Lola Akande, pledged that the ministry would continue to partner with the Council to promote commerce and sustainable business development in the State.
 
Akande, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Mrs. Olatokunbo Emokpae, explained that the Council’s meeting on MSMEs is a platform through which technical, financial and other business support linkages are promoted between MSMEs operators and support agencies in the State and at the Federal level.
   
The commissioner further noted that the meetings also provide an opportunity for credible feedback on the challenges faced by MSMEs in the state, imploring members of the council to proffer lasting solutions to the challenges facing MSMEs in Lagos. 
 
She said: “I must commend all council members for your commitment in ensuring pragmatic solutions to difficulties hindering the growth and development of MSMEs in the State.” 
 
She averred that the state government would continue to initiate and administer policies and interventions that would enhance, promote, attract and harness the potentials of MSMEs for the development and growth of the economy.
