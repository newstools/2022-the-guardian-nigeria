Cali’s security undersecretary Jimmy Dranguet told AFP it was an attack “with explosives.” With 2.2 million inhabitants, Cali is the third-largest city in Colombia and one of the most violent in Latin America. It is in one of the biggest coca cultivation areas in Colombia, the world’s largest cocaine producer. Colombia is officially at peace after signing a pact with the FARC guerrilla group in 2016 to end more than a half-century of armed conflict. But it has seen a flare-up of violence in recent months due to fighting over territory and resources by dissident guerrillas, the ELN rebel group, paramilitary forces and drug cartels.
