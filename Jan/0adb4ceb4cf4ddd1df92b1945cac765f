Operatives of Imo State Police Command have arrested a man suspected to be a ritualist.
  
The suspect is said to hail from Anambra State, but resides in Nworieubi, Mbaitoli Local Council of the state.
 
Spokesperson for the command, Michael Abattam, who confirmed the incident yesterday, said the suspect had invited a 14-year-old boy, and inflicted a machete cut on the lad, who is also the son of his friend in the vicinity.
 
The Guardian learnt that the suspect, in a ploy to send the boy a message, allegedly planned to kill him and bury him in a grave he dug at the centre of his room.
