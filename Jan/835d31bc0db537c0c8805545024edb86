The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has said that the N10 million reward given to Super Falcons during an award ceremony in Lagos, last year by Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, is for all members of the 1999 class, not for a few individuals. Former Super Falcons winger, U.S.-based Patience Avre, had alleged on Tuesday that the N10 million has been diverted into private pockets by some of her teammates. Avre, who could not make it to the award ceremony in Lagos, as she just put to bed, vowed to get to the root of what she described as ‘major scandal’ in the Super Falcons class of ’99. About five key members of the Super Falcons team to USA ’99 FIFA World Cup, where Nigeria got to the quarterfinal, were said to be left out of the largesse by their ‘greedy’ teammates. However, a top official of the NFF told The Guardian yesterday that the N10 million was meant for all the players. “The N10m was given to the Super Falcons class of ’99, and I don’t know why some players are laying claims to it. The same way the award ceremony was organised for all the players. Not all the players were able to attend the ceremony in Lagos, but whatever that was given is for all of them. That includes the N10 million given by Onyema. We are not happy with what we are hearing. The NFF has directed that all those involved in sharing of the money should refund it, and make sure all the players get their share,” the official said. Another source hinted, yesterday, that the NFF might blacklist the ‘greedy’ 14 from its good books, just as he said the federation is planning to deduct the money from their share of $1,000 promised each member of the 1999 team during the ceremony.
