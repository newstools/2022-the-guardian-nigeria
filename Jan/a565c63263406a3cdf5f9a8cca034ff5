Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the Grassroots Mobilisers Association of Northern Nigeria (GMANN) has backed the South-East geopolitical zone to produce the next president of the country. It tipped former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, to succeed President Mhammadu Buhari come 2023. In a statement issued, yesterday, Convener and National Chairman of the group, Alhaji Muritala Mohammed, noted: “Igbo presidency is ideal for 2023 because it will bring about the political stability needed to entrench peaceful coexistence among all citizens of the country.” He also explained that GMANN backed Kalu for the top position because he has the credentials and pedigree to successfully pilot the affairs of the country. He added that the former governor has the capacity to manage the country’s resources in a 21st-century economy considering his profile as an international businessman, former governor and now senator. Mohammed further described Kalu as “a democrat, fighter for the people and detribalised Nigerian, who would be acceptable to all parts of the country and the international community.” “We have made our checks and picked Kalu as the one who is much better to take over from President Buhari in 2023 because he has the exposure, experience and capacity to unite the people, reposition our future with adequate management of our resources and transform our nation into a safe, secure entity and a prosperous 21st-century economy,” he added.
