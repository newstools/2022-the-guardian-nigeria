In Roman mythology, January is named after the Roman god, Janus. That is because Janus is a two-faced god that looks to the past and the present, hence his duality and identity as the patron of January. As we end the roller coaster ride of 2021, we, therefore, become like the ancient Roman god who looks to the past and the present all at once, awaiting another new year in hope; being receptive to the new year with gratitude and aspirations. And so the #Newyear2022 resolutions emerge. Why do we even have to make New Year resolutions? There is an ample list, beginning with the most obvious: because we are alive. Another is that it is a way to project our attention and focus of the year.
As you reflect on the New Year and what it brings, it behoves us to take those steps necessary to achieve those goals which will turn into reality. Here is how the New Year is ushered in; A Year To Start Over NEW YEAR TRADITION. Latin American and Spanish New Year traditional. Funny ritual to eat twelve 12 grapes for good luck at midnigth. Flat lay, top view. Christmas New Year composition According to science, go with steps that mean something to you, understanding why you would want to work towards attaining your goal throughout the year. Hey, remember that you are human, so when you experience setbacks, rather than criticise yourself for stalling and falling short of expectations, nurse your wound as you would do for another. Such an approach will inspire you to build self-control towards your goals. When you feel like throwing in the towel, look back at your visions; the process is hard but the gains are wonderful. These visions should be specific and attainable.

Different cultures and countries perform rituals while some feast. Celebrating the new year with a feast is fairly a universal affair, but there are special meals that significantly make an appearance. For some, long noodles represent long life, and there are some who use peas to represent coins, still others, pigs to represent good luck. In the American South, “Hoppin John” is a meal full of flavour that is done at this time. The pork flavoured field peas or black-eyed peas mean more than munching. The field peas or black-eyed peas represent coins, while the greens served with rice is the money hoped for in the year. There again, the cornbread is the colour of gold. This dish finds its footing in African and West Indian traditions that were arguably brought by slaves to North America. In Spain, the cultural practices of “twelve grapes’’ are used to usher in the new year. In performing this observance, the people gather in front of the square’s clock tower. While at the square, at the strike of midnight, taking part are those from their coaches watching this significant event unravel. This ritual came to be in the 20th century and was possibly made up by grape producers in the southern part of the country. The tradition has since become larger than life, spreading to many Spanish-speaking nations.

In Chinese culture, the New Year is celebrated on the first new moon of the Lunar calendar, which dates to 1st February. The fireworks used at this celebration are believed to ward off evil and are not just used for a grand display or gusto of the new year. In all of that, the “tray of togetherness” which contains sweets is made available for visitors as it serves as a symbol of wealth, health, and happiness. Although the Gregorian calendar dictates a large percentage of the world celebrates January 1st as the first day of the year, the New Year is celebrated based on conventions, cultures and religions put in place. As such, other cultures are guided by other types of cultural and religious calendars like the Lunar calendar. All in all, in this #NewYear, remember to make fresh memories on the blank page this new year offers.
