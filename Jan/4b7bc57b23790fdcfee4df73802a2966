I am following with keen interest Governor Nyesom Wike’s directive to local council chairmen to produce within 48 hours Nigerians in oil areas who are involved in illegal refinery of crude petroleum oil in their backyards. There are 23 local governments in the state. The Rivers State governor has a handsome sum of N2 million reward for each local council chief who surrenders any local man involved in what scientists familiar with the business call fractional distillation of petroleum. Any chairman who fails to produce such “criminals” in his domain would be removed from office, the governor threatened them. I hope I heard the irrepressible governor correctly; a governor who does not suffer fools gladly! An action governor with a place in my heart. What with his VAT battle.  His drive deserving of support is that everyone must live on earned income. It is what the Law of Nature requires of every human being. It is in effort and struggle, talents and abilities unfold. But an elected local government chairman being removed peremptorily by a governor? I wonder if he has heard about Seyi Makinde and Local Government Chairmen settled case in Oyo State. I am all ears, following with untrammeled interest. I would like to be kept posted of developments.
