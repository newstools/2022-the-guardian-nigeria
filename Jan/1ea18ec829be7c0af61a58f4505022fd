Lagos State Government has announced that the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines are now available at designated public and private vaccination centres across the state. Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, made this known through his official Instagram account, including the receipt of a new batch of vaccines from the National Primary Healthcare Board. The commissioner urged all eligible residents to proceed to the centres to get vaccinated. He also announced the availability of booster doses at all the centres. “Administration of vaccines in public vaccination centres is free of charge. However, vaccination at private centres with the administration of two doses of COVID-19 vaccine will attract a service charge of N6,000, while one dose will attract N4,500,” he said, adding: “Lagos State Ministry of Health wishes to again reassure Lagos residents and the general public that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective.” Many residents had earlier lamented their inability to get the second dose of the vaccine after it went out of stock. The Moderna vaccine requires that people receive a second dose to get the maximum protection it provides, six weeks or 42 days after the first dose.
