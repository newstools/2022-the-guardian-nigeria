Akwa Ibom Governor Udom Emmanuel has ended months of speculations and permutations with the presentation of one of his cabinet members to succeed him as governor in 2023. At a well attended PDP Stakeholders’ Meeting which took place this evening at the Governor’s Lodge, in Uyo, Emmanuel announced his Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Umo Eno, as his preferred choice to succeed him. Former Governor, Obong Victor Attah, thereafter formally presented Eno to the Stakeholders which comprises major and leading political chieftains from the three Senatorial Districts, who all applauded the choice and pledged to work towards his emergence as the governor of the state come 2023. Responding to the governor’s endorsement, Eno spoke about how he grew up in the Police barracks and how dreary and challenging those days were, but he summoned hope to overcome those difficulties. He said he was grateful to God and to Governor Emmanuel for finding him worthy of the onerous task to lead the people of the State and continue the people-focused and developmental strides of the present administration. Bishop Uma Ukpai and the Prelate Emeritus of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr. Sunday Mbang prayed for his success. This was re-echoed by the Oku Ibom Ibibio and Chairman of State Council of Chiefs, Ntenyin Solomon Etuk.
