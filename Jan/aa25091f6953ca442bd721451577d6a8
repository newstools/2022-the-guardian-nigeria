   Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) has applauded actions by Rivers State government to address oil theft and refining of stolen crude oil. The group also called on Federal and state governments in the Niger Delta region to convene a national dialogue to discuss and agree on steps to deal with the menace. Dr. Godwin Uyi Ojo, Executive Director of ERA/FoEN, in a statement, said: Although the current action of the Rivers State government is a welcome respite for the people of the state, more still needs to be done.  The group noted that a 2016 World Health Organisation (WHO) factsheet on air pollution stated that air pollution around the world is responsible for 4.2 million premature deaths globally, every year. 
   
Ojo said: “Although, the current action of the Rivers State government is a welcomed respite for the people of the state, more still needs to be done. The governments of other Niger Delta states need to take similar actions by identifying and properly decommissioning all illegal crude oil refining sites in their states to halt this self-inflicted destruction of our environment and unnecessary loss of lives.”
