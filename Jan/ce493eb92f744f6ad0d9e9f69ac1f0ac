Operatives of the Ogun State Police Command have arrested a 14-year-old housemaid, Favour Iwuozor for allegedly kidnaping the two-year-old son of her mistress. The Command’s Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said the suspect was arrested on Monday in the Sagamu following a complaint lodged at Sagamu divisional headquarters by one Victoria Nwafor. Oyeyemi disclosed that Nwafor told the police that she saw a 14-year-old girl on the 22nd of December 2021, with a very sick two-year-old boy in Yaba Lagos. “She stated further that the little girl was begging for alms under the pretence that the small boy is her younger brother and that their parents died in a ghastly accident in December 2020,” Oyeyemi said. “Out of compassion, the woman took both of them to her house in Sagamu in order to take care of the little boy deteriorating health condition. “But immediately the boy fully recovered, the suspect wanted to single-handedly take the boy to Imo state and this aroused the woman’s suspicion prompting her to report to the police. “Upon the report, the DPO Sagamu division, CSP Okiki Agunbiade detailed his detectives to bring the girl for interrogation. Oyeyemi said the girl confessed that she was a maid to the mother of the little boy and that she left with the boy since on the 19th of December 2021, with the intention of taking him to Amraku Umorsu in Isiala/Mberna local government area of Imo State. “She stated further that, she took the baby from the church during the Sunday school period, and since the Sunday school teacher knows her with the baby’s mother, she has no problem releasing the baby to her. “She explained further that she decided to beg for alms in order to raise transport fare to Imo State”, the PPRO said.
