The Head of Service, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, has tasked union leaders to make sacrifices in some areas when engaging the government on workers’ behalf. He stressed that this was important, as both parties must have a cordial working relationship, as well as be partners in progress. Speaking at the opening of a retreat for union leaders in state-themed, “Employer/Employee Relations in the New World of Work,” organised by the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions, Muri-Okunola who was represented by the Permanent Secretary, Public Service Office, Mr. Samson Ajibade, congratulated the ministry as well as the labour unions for creating room for interaction, acknowledging the role of labour unions in the development of the state. Muri-Okunola advised union leaders against fighting for their members alone but to also advise the government on key areas for development. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Labour and Industrial Relations, Mr. Babatunde Oladeinde Williams, urged labour leaders to network, socialise and engage in productive interaction with government officials with the aim of creating a symbiotic bond, and promoting industrial harmony in the state. He described the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration as a labour-friendly one that is committed to ensuring excellent service delivery to the people of the state, through a well-motivated and competent work force. In his remark, the Chairman, Joint Pubic Service Negotiating Council, Comrade Olusegun Rahmon Balogun, commended the state government for the initiative, which has become a yearly event in the government’s calendar. Lectures on leadership, emotional intelligence and industrial harmony and sustainable productivity were delivered.
