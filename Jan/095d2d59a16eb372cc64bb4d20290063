Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, will add to his huge sports resume on February 12, 2022 when he joins Lagos State Governor and host of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to participate in the 2022 edition. Speaking while signing the entry form over the weekend, Shaibu said he has been a distant admirer of the event. “I congratulate the good people of Lagos State, especially Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for putting together the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, the biggest one-day sports event in Africa and one of the top 10 marathons in the world in terms of prize money and participants. “Having participated in the highly competitive Okpekpe 10km Road Race on a tough terrain because it is hilly, it will be a great joy to experience the race alongside my brother, Governor Sanwo-Olu. It will be fun to run in Lagos because the course is flat.” An avid golfer, Shaibu is also a passionate footballer. He etched his name in sports history when he led Team Edo football team to win the male football gold medal at the 20th National Sports Festival (NSF) in Benin. Speaking on the event, General Manager, Access Bank Lagos City Marathon, Yussuf Alli, urged politicians and celebrities to emulate Shaibu, saying, “being active in sports cures many illness and diseases. “Our leaders and celebrities, who the masses emulate, should join Shaibu by embracing sports culture. This will translate to mass participation in sports leading to a healthier workforce and less expenditure on healthcare by the government.”
