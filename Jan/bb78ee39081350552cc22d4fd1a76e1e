Beautiful moments from your holiday travels can’t possibly be re-lived because we can’t go back in time but they can be preserved in various ways. Here are some tips on how you can preserve moments from your travels and make them last a lifetime. Take pictures and print them <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1631221 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts-676x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1133" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts-676x598.jpg 676w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts-271x240.jpg 271w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts-542x480.jpg 542w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts-600x531.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Polaroids.-Photo-Designbolts.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Photographing interesting scenes of places one has been to, is one of the best ways of keeping memories. Pictures serve as a visual tool for capturing the physical. The pictures can either be digital or paper. Digital pictures are easy to preserve but can be hard to access. This is why it is preferable to print out pictures. Printed pictures are quicker to access especially when kept in a photo album. Captured moments make it hard for the memories behind them to be forgotten. Through pictures, you get to savour the moments of laughter, the big smile you had on your face when something silly happened and the beautiful sights you saw when you visited different places on your vacation. Taking pictures can be a great way to help you travel back in time and remember the wonderful time you had during your vacation. Make videos One of the great ways to save moments in motion from your vacation is by making videos. With videos, you get to see past moments played in their actual form. Videos make it possible to revisit memories and watch them play in motion exactly how they happened. You can capture every activity that happens on your trip, from going on fun rides to relaxing in a spa, swimming in a pool or at the beach, going mountain climbing or tasting foreign dishes, videos can help keep those memories forever. You can either save them on your digital space or burn them into a CD. Whichever way one decides, it will still effectively serve its retention purpose. Have a backup storage Digital videos and pictures can be easily erased, taking away all of the memories it holds, with it. However, storing copies of your videos and pictures in a place other than your phone, computer or memory card will help avoid the risk of losing all of the saved moments from your holiday vacation. Some of the tools that can serve as backup storage include an external hard drive, Google photos, Icloud and social media apps. All these can help restore your videos and pictures if they get wiped. Keep a journal <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1631223 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-895x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="856" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-895x598.jpg 895w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-1723x1152.jpg 1723w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-1536x1027.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-2048x1369.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-320x214.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-640x428.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Writing out moments of how your holidays are going is a smart way to preserve memories. A Journal allows you to completely capture the feeling you experience while enjoying time spent on your holiday vacation or celebration. More so, you can be creative with your journals by pasting pictures or postcards on each page as you write down your experience. Writing it all in a book lets you relive those memories if you ever decide to read it again. It also allows others to visualise those memories when passed down to them. With a journal, you can share memories with friends, your children and your grandchildren.

When you get to see the item it reminds you of where you got it and how you felt about the environment. One of the great values of a souvenir is that it helps you remember the delightful things about your trip. Memories are precious and they should be preserved. The preserved moments helps you to never forget the risks you took, the fun things you did and the thrilling experience you had while doing them.
