Sixteen teams will participate in the Mark D’Ball Basketball Championship billed to begin on January 15 at Package B of the M.K.O Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. The championship, put together by Igoche Mark, proprietor of Mark Mentors Basketball Club to promote the sport in the country and also discover grassroots talents, according to the organisers, attracted more entries this week to increase the participating teams from the initial 12 to 16. Secretary of the Local Organising Committee (LOC), Umaru Abdullahi, said the 16 teams participating in the Mark D’Ball tourney were chosen based on the continuous clamour of Nigerian clubs to participate in the championship after a long lay off. “Upon consideration of requests from clubs to participate in Mark D’Ball Championship, we (LOC) decided to increase the number of participating teams from 12 to 16. It is glaring that the appeal from clubs is due to a drought of basketball games for a long time, and we decided to increase the number to accommodate these requests,” he said. The team listed for the competition are Air Warriors, Firstbank, Delta Force, Sunshine Angels, Customs, Novena Queens, Kada Angels, Benue Princess and Plateau Rocks. Others are Mountain of Fire, FCT Rocks, IGP Queens, Taraba Hurricanes, Nasarawa Amazons, Hot Coal Sizzlers and Bayelsa Basketball clubs. Abdullahi advised all participating teams to adhere strictly to COVID-19 protocols, while disclosing that the women will play from January 15 to 22, while the men’s competition will hold from January 22 to April 23.
