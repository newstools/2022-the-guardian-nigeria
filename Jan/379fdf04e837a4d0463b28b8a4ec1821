Pioneering Bahamian-American actor, Sidney Poitier, who died this month at the age of 94, was Hollywood’s first black global megastar, appearing in over 40 films. His 2000 autobiography, The Measure of A Man, recalled how his success had been achieved against seemingly insurmountable odds. Poitier’s parents – Evelyn and Reginald – were tomato farmers on the poverty-ridden Cat Island in the Bahamas. Sidney was born in Miami two months prematurely where his parents had travelled to sell tomatoes. His father did not expect the tiny child to survive, and had bought a small coffin. His mother, however, consulted a local soothsayer who predicted that her seventh and youngest child “will walk with kings (and) be rich and famous.”
 
The Pioneer
The charismatic Poitier became the first black actor in history to win a lead actor Oscar in 1964 at the age of 37, a record matched only 38 years later when Denzel Washington and Halle Berry triumphed in the same category at the 2002 Oscars at which Poitier also won a lifetime award. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama in 2009, having been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. Poitier radically changed perceptions of black people from the 1950s, as the American civil rights struggle raged, forcing the gilded gates of Hollywood open to other black actors.
