Oyofo professionally known as SR Greene is an Afrosoulfusion maestro who hails from Edo state, Southern Region of Nigeria, West Africa. SR Greene is proving to be a highly sought-after artist right now following his performance alongside Grammy Award Winner, Wizkid at the Pinaza Music Festival at the Warri township stadium on the 18th of December 2021. He also performed alongside Teni and Buju at the “Play the play musical concert” at the Akure Township Stadium on the 29th of December 2021. The raving act wasted no time to clinch the top spot of Nigeria’s iTunes chart upon its release, amidst other popular releases like; Mayorkun & Victony – Holy Father, Goya Menor – Ameno Remix, Ruger – Dior, Kizz Daniel – Barnabas, Fave – Baby Riddim and many other. “My Pain” has remained on the chart for one week showing that the singer is here to stay and is available across all digital platforms worldwide! SR Greene’s “My Pain” is a heartfelt spirited song that was inspired by his mother’s transition to glory at precisely 2 AM, on the 26th day of June 2020. The pains and void of losing someone so dear and eternally irreplaceable coupled with the turmoils faced in the journey of life in general including the effects from parasitic friends were the reasons this song was orchestrated.
