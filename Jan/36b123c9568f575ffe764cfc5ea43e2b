Filled with symbolic meanings, the monochrome video was directed by Sam Brown. This warrants a new beginning for the songstress as she discovers her life as a divorcee. To capture, perhaps, the visualisation that displays the breakdown of her marriage and her rebirth, a chair is set alight near the end of the song- with eagle-eyed fans noticing how she had sung from a chair in Hometown Glory, “Rolling In The Deep” and “Easy On Me”. Adele, 30, and Sam, who had previously worked with her in “Rolling In The Deep” music video, sourced inspiration from religious undertones to link with the title of the single. The setting of the video is in a giant warehouse with the “Chasing Pavements” songstress is seen to scuffle between heaven and hell. A mirrored reflection showcases an inner confusion within herself as apples lay all over the floor to reflect temptation. The music video display Adele in high fashion. The singer is dressed by an array of top designers including Louis Vuitton and Vivienne Westwood and wearing Harris Reed X Missoma jewellery for the video. Adele wears a pellegrin clerical cape above a ballgown singing in front of a halo for one look, before wowing in a off-the-shoulder red dress holding an apple- the forbidden fruit. A huge python also features in one scene, entangled itself around her chair enhanced with acrobats performing stunts and dancing around the singer. Adele also sits in the chair next to the horse, while a dancer tentatively picks a daisy petal by petal on the floor- something which mystified viewers.
