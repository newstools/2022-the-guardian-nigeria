Despite COVID-19 Challenges, We’re Ready For Nigeria, Says Tunisia’s Coach Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has admitted that interim coach, Augustine Eguavoen, has changed the mentality of the players and given them more freedom to express themselves. Speaking at the pre-match conference yesterday ahead of today’s Round of 16 game against Tunisia, Ndidi said he has so far enjoyed his game and hopes to help the team achieve its aim of a fourth AFCON title. “I just love to enjoy my football and see how I can contribute in my own little way to the success of the Super Eagles,” he stated. On why the Super Eagles have changed from being lukewarm in their approach to games since it was the same set of players that went to Egypt 2019, Ndidi said: “Yes, it is the same set of players, but a new manager has come in with a different mentality. He has told us to believe in ourselves and given us more freedom. That is the only difference between now and the 2019 team.” Commenting on today’s match, Ndidi said he and his teammates are ready for the Tunisians. “We are ready and hope we get our tactics right because we have put in a lot in terms of training. Our target is the trophy, but first thing, we have to take each match as it comes.” On his part, the Assistant Coach of Tunisia, Jalal Kadri, revealed to journalists that his team is still ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, but added that they will go all out to wrestle the quarterfinal ticket from Nigeria. “We are still having a lot of problems as far as COVID-19 pandemic is concerned. So many of our players and technical crew members are down. We don’t have the details yet, but hopefully, we will get over it and get a good result against Nigeria,” he said.
