• Kalu berates aspirants declaring to ambition Buhari
• APC refutes report on suspension of convention The United States Mission in Nigeria has taken bold steps to bolster democracy in the country by defending free and fair elections. Spokesperson of the mission, Jeanne Clark, at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) in Kano State, yesterday, said fighting corruption and defending credible elections are central to U.S. government’s action plan. The U.S. is taking bold action in supporting free and independent media, fighting corruption, bolstering democratic reforms, as well as advancing technology for democracy and political process, she said. According to Clark, getting things done in a democratic setting is not always easy, as democracy is messy and hard that no one would get all they want. CHIEF Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has described, as unserious, presidential aspirants in All Progressives Congress (APC) running to President Muhammadu Buhari to inform him of their political ambition. The former governor of Abia State spoke to newsmen at the foyer of the National Assembly, just before yesterday’s plenary. He explained that they failed to wait for the party to decide on where to zone the Presidency. APC has refuted reports of its decision to suspend the national convention of the party scheduled for February 27. The Caretaker Secretary, Sen. John Akpanudoedehe, stated, yesterday, that there is no iota of truth in the story.
He enjoined the general public to disregard what it termed as “fake news” on the issue by some media outlets. The party maintained that those behind the story were bent on causing confusion and fomenting crisis in the party through such misinformation.
