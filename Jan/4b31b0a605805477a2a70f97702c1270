The solution to Nigeria’s myriad problems lies in the election of good leaders, says Jigawa Renaissance Group (JRG). Led by Mohammed Mash, the new political group, in a statement, yesterday, tagged ‘The Unending Growth of Poverty, Hunger, Insecurity – Who to Blame?’ urged the electorate to vote for competent and purposeful leadership in all elections in 2023. According to the group, these walloping variables could only be wiped out through taking leadership from the hands of inexperienced and corrupt politicians, who only care about their personal interests, to the detriment of the common man. The statement added that men of integrity, despite political affiliation, should be supported and voted into power in the 2023 general elections, for the country to move forward. Also, the group canvassed cutting down on the huge cost of governance at all levels, to avoid unnecessary borrowing, adding: “Likewise, let political appointees be trimmed down to avoid duplication.” JRG advised the incoming 10th National Assembly to either operate as unicameral parliament or place some members on part-time to minmise cost.	On the security challenges in the country, the group advocated overhauling of the security apparatus. It also advised the incoming leadership of the country to place premium on industrialisation to boost Internally Generated Revenue (IGR), exchange rate and to allow for gainful employment.
