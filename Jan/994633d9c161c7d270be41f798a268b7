Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirmed that the rapper is being investigated for the incident reported in the early hours of Thursday morning in LA. The LAPD revealed that its officers had responded to a call at 3 am in their statement. “A battery report was completed with Kanye West as a named suspect.” “No arrests have been made, and the incident is being investigated by our Newton Division,” they added. Dramatic footage of the incident shows West screaming, ‘Get away from me’ at a woman trying to calm him down while the unidentified fan lies on the floor, clutching his head in pain. The incident took place in Downtown LA at around 3 a.m. outside the Soho Warehouse. In the video, the woman identified as his cousin is heard telling the rapper, ‘I am your family,’ as she tries to get him to relax. ‘No, get away from me! Ain’t no hands, ain’t no hands,’ West yells. ‘You were supposed to talk with her,’ he adds as he walks away. Witnesses speaking to TMZ said West punched the fan twice in the head and once in the neck, striking him down as the fan hit his head on the sidewalk. The rapper had been pictured giving the alleged victim an autograph outside Craig’s restaurant on January 10. Hours before the alleged incident, the 44-year-old Donda rapper was seen socialising with Madonna, boxer Floyd Mayweather and actress Julia Fox in pictures Madonna posted on her Instagram. This news comes on the same day Ye was announced as a headliner for the 2022 Coachella music festival alongside Harry Styles and Billie Eilish. The singer is scheduled to perform in the Sunday slots at the festival, which takes place in the Southern Californian desert in April. Kanye West and their estranged wife are currently separated after she filed for divorce from the rapper citing irreconcilable differences that “continued to exist” between the pair. Ye and his representatives are yet to comment on this incident.
