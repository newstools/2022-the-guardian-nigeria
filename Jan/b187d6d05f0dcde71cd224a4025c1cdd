A Lagos Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court, Ikeja, yesterday, convicted and sentenced a middle age man, Sunday Oyedele to life imprisonment for defiling three-year-old neighbour (name withheld). The trial Justice Abiola Soladoye while delivering judgment described the convict Oyedele after he was found guilty of one count charge of defilement brought against him by the State Government. The judge held that that the prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. She described the convict as a “sexual monster,”paedophile who should be locked away. She said: “The defendant having been found guilty is sentenced to life imprisonment with no option of fine. He is also to have his name registered in the Sex Offenders Register as maintained by the Lagos State Government.” The prosecution team led by Mr. Olusola Soneye had told the court that the defendant committed the offence in November 2017. He had unlawful sexual intercourse with the toddler at Itamaga area of Ikorodu, Lagos. Oyedele was therefore arraigned on April 29, 2019. During the trial, the prosecution called four witnesses including a medical doctor from the Mirabel Centre (a Sexual Assault Referral Center) Dr. Oyedeji Alagbe, who testified. Alagbe in his evidence told the court that medical examinations revealed that the minor was defiled both anally and vaginally. The defendant, Oyedele testified solely in his defence led by his counsel, Mr Kelechi Obi.
