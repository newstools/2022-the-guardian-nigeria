Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) Nnamdi Kanu on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to 15 count charge of alleged terrorism and treasonable felony. Kanu made his plea at the hearing of the amended charges filed by the Nigerian government against the IPOB leader at the Federal High Court in Abuja. A lawyer to the Nigerian government requested permission from the court to open the case on the amended charges and called for the first witness. His request was, however, opposed by Kanu’s lead counsel Mike Ozekhome, who urged the court to hear the defendant’s application for preliminary objection and motion for bail. Ozekhome noted that the applications have been served on the prosecution and it is important to be heard first before any trial can commence. Judge Justice Binta Nyako held that the application filed by the defendant must be determined first, and the only application that will be taken is challenging the competency of the charge. Nyako adjourned the hearing till 16th February for a hearing of pending applications. The judge on Monday stated that she does not want to see Nnamdi Kanu wearing the same outfit to court at the next adjourned date. But counsel to the Nigerian government said the order of the court has been obeyed but the IPOB leader chose to wear the same outfit.
