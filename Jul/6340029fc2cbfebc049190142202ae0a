The Federal Character Commissioner representing Enugu State, Ginika Tor, yesterday, said that the South East would benefit more should her people cast their votes for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 general elections. Tor, who spoke to journalists in Enugu during a birthday celebration at the behest of her friends and political associates, cautioned that neither the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nor any other political party deserves southeasterners’ votes. According to Tor, Tinubu possesses the right qualities that could enable him to turn things around for the better, stressing that he understands Ndigbo’s agitations better than any other candidate in the election. 
  
“Our incoming President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, I’m supporting him 100 per cent. That is because everywhere I have gone, and from statistics that I have got, all you hear is that he is old. Nobody has said that he has not achieved anything meaningful for society. “But there is something you cannot take away from Bola Ahmed Tinubu, that is impacting people; building people, and I’m taking after him by empowering people because God has made me a voice for the voiceless,” said Tor who was recently appointed as the National Deputy Coordinator, BAT Global Ambassadors.
