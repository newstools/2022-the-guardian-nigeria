The Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) has called on industry stakeholders to work together to enable the sector to maximise the untapped potential in the economy and raise the confidence level. To this end, the newly-inaugurated President, CIIN, Edwin Igbiti, who spoke on strategies to redeem the industry’s battered image, after being sworn in as the new leader of the institute in Lagos, assured that his administration would unite the stakeholders and uphold professional ethics. Igbiti pledged while delivering his acceptance speech at his investiture as the 51st President. He said there was a need for continuity to sustain and build on the works of past presidents of the institute.
