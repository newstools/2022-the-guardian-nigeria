Nollywood actress Iyabo Ojo had tweeted, “Thank God I did that podcast with Chioma, just finish watching d reunion part2 & I can see a lot a said was edited & removed @ShowmaxNG I walked in on Chioma & Caro’s initial argument in d room in Dubai, none needed to tell me anything & Caro’s fake gift was returned #RHOLagos,” “Never have I seen an old crocodile believe in her own lies……. and old woman calling her mate old bcos she believe in her head that she’s 10 years younger…. @HrmCarolyna you are delusional mate #RHOLagos.” Responding, Carolyn Hutchings countered ““When you are desperate for a mean girls clique, you will cook up anything to recruit them ( old crocodile) .. if I have anything mean to say to you trust me it will be straight from my mouth … as a one-man squad zero Fffs given from here #theRoyals#RHOLagos,” This is not the first time stars of the show have taken to Twitter to air their grievances. Back in May, Hutchings and fellow housewife Toyin Lawani took to Twitter to accuse each other of their wrongdoings. Carolyna had called Toyin out for allegedly spreading rumours about her marriage to Musa Danjuma, which ended in 2019. She also asked Toyin to provide proof that she had publicly accused her before now of destroying her home. Carolyna tweeted, “Toyin, make it make sense to me. How do you know what ended my marriage when my marriage ended in 2016 and I stopped speaking with you in 2009?” “How can you be part of the break up when you never existed in it? Girl, stop with the lies. You ain’t that relevant.” Responding, Toyin wrote, “Stop normalizing my relationship I was engaged m*** &you ruined it , I was chased out with my Daughter , my stores where taken from me , I had no clothes on my back.” Twitter continues to buzz as fans share their views over the twists and turns the show brought in its first season.
