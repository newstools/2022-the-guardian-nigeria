A Federal High Court in Abuja, yesterday, adjourned till August 12, a suit instituted by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the propriety of the substitution of All Progressives Congress (APC) and Labour Party (LP) vice presidential candidates. The affected are Kabiru Masari and Doyin Okupe. In the suit filed by Goddy Uche (SAN), on behalf of PDP, the party is claiming that the Electoral Act 2022 did not make provision for a “place holder” or temporary running mate. The plaintiff is also contending that the APC and LP presidential candidates, Bola Tinubu, and Peter Obi, could only qualify to contest the 2023 polls election with Masari and Okupe as running mates. It claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) lacks the powers to accept the substitutions in the absence of both parties conducting fresh primaries to substitute Tinubu and Peter Obi. PDP averred that Masari and Okupe were not products of any primary, and as such, were not validly nominated. The claimant also stated that the electoral umpire could not validly make any other election timetable for the substitutions any day later than June 17, 2022. At yesterday’s proceeding, PDP, represented by Pius Damba Pius, informed Justice Donatus Okoronwo that it had filed a motion on notice seeking to join more parties in the suit. The counsel, who held brief for the SAN, further told the court that the motion on notice for joinder had been served on the parties on record. The claim of service was, however, disputed by the parties on record.
