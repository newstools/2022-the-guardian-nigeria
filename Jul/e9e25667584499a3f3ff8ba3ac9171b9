However, they are also excellent especially when you consider whatever filling you choose. The idea of pillowy, silky dough encasing a rich, intensely flavorful filling will make you feel warm and cozy from the inside out. In any case, we’re bringing that cozy, homey feeling to your own kitchen table with our handmade dumpling recipe.
Ingredient
4 cups all-purpose flour(500 g)
2 teaspoons salt, divided
1 ¼ cups warm water(300 mL)
2 cups red cabbage(200 g)
2 cups green onion(300 g), sliced
6 cloves garlic, minced
4 tablespoons ginger, minced
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons sesame oil
½ lb ground pork(225 g)
½ teaspoon pepper
¾ cup mushroom(55 g), diced
¾ cup carrot(90 g), diced
½ lb shrimp(225 g), peeled and deveined Method
Mix the flour, warm water, and one teaspoon of salt together in a large bowl. On a surface dusted with flour, roll out the dough and smooth it out. Cut the dough into four equal pieces. Depending on the size of the dumplings you desire, divide one piece of dough into 6 or 8 equal pieces after rolling it out into a thin log. Continue by using the remaining dough pieces. Roll out one piece of dough into a thin circle that is about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter after lightly flouring the dough pieces. Repeat with the remaining dough, keeping the dumpling wrappers separated with a tiny piece of parchment paper. In a medium bowl, mix the cabbage, green onions, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and sesame oil until evenly combined. To make the pork filling, stir together 1 cup (125g) of the cabbage mixture, the remaining teaspoon of salt, the pepper, and the ground pork. Combine the mushrooms and carrot for the vegetarian filling, and microwave for three minutes, or until soft. One cup (125g) of the cabbage mixture should be added and thoroughly mixed in. To make the shrimp filling, whisk the shrimp into the remaining 1 cup (125g) of the cabbage mixture. Place around 1 heaping tablespoon of filling in the middle of each dumpling wrapper before assembling the dumplings. Apply a thin layer of water to the wrapper’s exterior with your finger. Utilizing your fingers, fold the wet half of the wrapper over the filling and pleat the edges to close it. Do the same for the remaining. Add a few dumplings to a big skillet that has been heated to medium-high heat. They are cooked in batches as they are added. The dumplings’ bottoms should be browned before adding a splash of water and a lid. The dumplings should steam for around 5 minutes, or until they are cooked and the water has disappeared. To get rid of any extra moisture or grease, place the cooked dumplings to a platter covered with paper towels. Soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and pepper flakes should all be combined in a small bowl. With the dipping sauce on the side, serve the dumplings right away.
Enjoy!
