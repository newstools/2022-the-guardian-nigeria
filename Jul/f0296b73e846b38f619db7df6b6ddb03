Emerging factors seem to be moderating earlier narratives on how the Osun governorship race is turning out, especially the outcome of the June 18, 2022 governorship election in Ekiti State, which was won by the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Abiodun Oyebanji.  Again, the new strategy of vote-buying adopted by the parties in Ekiti, of which the ruling APC had upper hand due to its superior financial power, may also reduce the impact of Labour Party and Accord Party to mere underdogs in the coming Osun poll. 
 
Observers are now saying that instead of the initially projected four-horse race, the contest is actually going to be between the incumbent governor and Senator Ademola Adeleke. The two parties have proven organised political structures and financial resources to prosecute the election.
 
If the electoral umpire and other transparency watchdogs go to sleep regarding vote-buying, Ekiti might just be child’s play, with APC going all out to use resources to secure second term for the incumbent. The APC also has the advantage of the federal support. The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had said it was ready to match naira for naira and dollar for dollar, if the need be to win the race.  Possible realignment and fresh alliances
There has been a gale of defections from and to APC and PDP and Accord Party.
Loyalists of Aregbesola are moving to Osun PDP. Their defection followed the spate of protests that trailed the controversial State and National Assembly primaries of APC, where the Senator Abdulahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) is yet to release the results of winners and losers, despite public outcry and protests by aspirants and other party members.  Against this backdrop of defections, there are chances this may increase the chances of parties and candidates while others may not have much electoral impact.
