Nigeria and Ghana have stepped up plans to raise the standard of squash in West African. Both countries will do so by organising world-class championships to assist in improving squash players’ skills. Speaking at the international friendly between Nigeria and Ghana held at the Squash Court of Ikoyi Club, the Technical Director of the Nigeria Squash Federation (NSF), Yusuf Durusinlorun, reiterated the need for West African countries to have exchange programmes to help improve, promote squash and other sports in the region. He noted that NSF would continue to give more Nigerian youths the opportunity to take part in the game by organising more events at the grassroots. While commending the NSF for giving Team Ghana the needed platform to prepare for the forthcoming Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, by organising the tune up games, the President of Ghana’s Squash Federation, Richard Quarion, said his desire lies in a sustainable relationship between the two countries in the game of squash. He stressed that the friendly game against Nigeria exposed Team Ghana on more technical aspects of the sport. The two-day international friendly, which is the first time the two neighbouring countries are competing against each other, saw the players take part in team, singles and doubles events. He commended the squash players for the growth of the game in the region, adding that a lot still needed to be done to meet up with the world standard. In the final results of the international friendlies played, Femi Shedara (Nigeria) beat Dimpson Dodoo of Ghana 11/4,11/9,11/3 3-0.
