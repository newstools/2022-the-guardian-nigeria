Over 300 players from across the country are expected to feature in a tournament billed to usher in Tiger Club’s new executive committee at the Army Barracks, Odogbo, Ibadan. According to the new captain of the club, Tunde Salami, the new committee will hit the ground running by building on recently achieved landmark projects of the club, such as the construction of green putting surfaces and revamping of its 18-room guest house that now runs like the Ritz. “I must confess that my predecessors have done creditably well, but there is still a lot of work to be done,” Salami said. “I will move into upgrading the club’s reception area and create a central cashing point. There will be a total clean-up of the fairways and general revamping of our bunkers. “I need not say much now. I can only assure you that this new committee will meet up with the expectations of our numerous members,” he added. A notable member of the club’s board of trustees, Colonel Ade Sunmonu, affirmed the readiness of the new executive to deliver on its mandate.
