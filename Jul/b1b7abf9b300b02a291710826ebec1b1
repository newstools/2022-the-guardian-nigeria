The Ogun State governor, Dapo Abiodun, has declared Tuesday, July 26 a work-free day for all workers in the state to go and register for their Permanent Voters Registration (PVC) ahead of the 2023 general elections. This was announced in a statement by the governor’s spokesman, Kunle Somorin, on Sunday. Abiodun said, the “one-day public holiday is to provide a window for all workers in the state, who have either lost their cards, not registered or who might need to travel to their wards, local government areas and constituencies to perfect their Permanent Voters Registration or transfer their cards, where necessary, to enable them to participate in the next general elections”. He added that as an inclusive and accountable government the role of PVCs to the citizens cannot be “overemphasised”. The governor also urged all eligible citizens to seize this chance to get their voter cards ready in order to avoid any excuses that may hinder them from voting.
