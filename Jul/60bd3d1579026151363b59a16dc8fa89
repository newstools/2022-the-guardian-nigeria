Over 700 youngsters from 22 teams have converged on venues across Anambra State to battle for honours in the 2022 Youth Sports Federation of Nigeria (YSFON) U-17 Cup, also known as Ramat Cup, which kicked off at the weekend.                              
  
At the opening match in Neros Stadium, Nanka, World Football Academy of Nanka defeated Aguata Grassroots Football Academy 2-0, while Austica Sports Academy beat Menon Football Club of Umunze 3-0. On Monday at Awka Temporary Stadium, Peace FC of Awka defeated Solar Spiders FC of Nibo 3-0. Anambra State YSFON Secretary, Ralph Nweke, told The Guardian that the tournament would end on August 21 at Neros Stadium, Nanka.  Noting that the winner of the 2022 event will represent the state in next year’s Ramat Cup, Nweke appreciated the sponsors, including Nanka Patriots, Neros and Visa Oil, while calling for more support. He urged the state government to partner with the Maduakonam Obiefuna-led state YSFON to promote and develop youth football in the state.
 
He noted that the past editions helped to discover talented professional players like Nonso Nzediegwu of Heartland FC of Owerri and Mary Anjor of Bayelsa Queens, Rivers State.                                           
  
He stated that the winner of the competition would earn a trophy and cash prize of N200, 000, while first and second runners up will win N150, 000 and N100, 000 respectively.
