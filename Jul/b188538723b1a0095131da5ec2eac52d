Minister of Environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, has said reducing greenhouse emission by 20 per cent and 43 per cent conditionally by 2030 remains sacrosanct. Abdullahi, who disclosed this in Abuja during a programme held in collaboration with International Energy Charter and Economic Community of West African States, stressed the need for huge investments in low or no carbon-based energy systems. He urged government to look into projects with clear environmental benefits and promote the transition of low-carbon and climate resilient growth. He called for climate mitigation and adaptation, which further opens additional investment initiatives under Nigeria’s energy transition plan, where issuers, suppliers, manufacturers and a host of other value chain activities generate enormous opportunities. He disclosed that the energy summit is a flagship event of the Energy Commission of Nigeria, and is organised yearly with the objectives of identifying challenges and proffering solutions in the energy sector. On his part, Secretary General of International Energy Charter, Guy Lentz, said an energy master plan will analyse efficiency, be a win-win situation for Africa and the world, and bring lots of benefits.
