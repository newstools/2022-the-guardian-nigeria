The World Health Organisation (WHO), yesterday, declared the monkeypox outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Even though there was no consensus among members of the WHO’s emergency committee on the monkeypox outbreak, regarding their advice on the determination of a PHEIC for the disease, the global body’s boss, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghrebeyesus, insisted that the multi-country outbreak of Monkeypox constitutes a PHEIC. Ghrebeyesus said that the measure was in recognition of the complexities and uncertainties associated with this public health event, and having considered the views of committee members and advisors, as well as other factors in line with international health regulations. He said, “We have an outbreak that has spread around the world rapidly, through new modes of transmission, about which we understand too little,” Tedros said, adding, “for all of these reasons, I have decided that the global Monkeypox outbreak represents a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.” The global health body issued temporary recommendations to different groups of states parties, based on their epidemiological situation, patterns of transmission and capacities stressing that the temporary recommendations are expected to be implemented in full in respect of established principles of human rights, inclusion and the dignity of all individuals and communities.
