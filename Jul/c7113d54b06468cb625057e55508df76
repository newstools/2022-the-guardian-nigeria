The Oluwo of Iwoland, Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, yesterday, said he would deliver over 90,000 votes for Governor Gboyega Oyetola in the Osun State governorship election held yesterday. The monarch stated this after casting his vote at Unit 1 Ward 2, in Iwo town local council. Although he said traditional rulers were not supposed to be partisan, he noted that his love for Oyetola grew because of his prompt payment of workers’ salaries. He said, “It is not easy for the governor to move from the status quo and do what is right. He has been paying his full salary. Osun is a civil servant state and the people depend on salaries. “He has been paying debts inherited and didn’t use the money for frivolities. I have told my people to vote for the APC and they will vote for APC. The governor is doing a great job. I believe the person doing a great job should continue. I want all persons to vote peacefully.”
 
He however bemoaned the fact that vote buying cannot stop in the country with the way politicians run the system. He noted that the menace could not stop until the government did the needful and allowed people to enjoy the dividends of democracy. “Vote buying is a challenge to democracy. The populace doesn’t have hope. It is a bad situation. We do not know when to get out of it. People are hungry. They need food. Vote buying cannot stop now until we see real dividends of democracy,” Oluwo said.
