Amid the raging controversy surrounding its authentic governorship candidate, the Delta State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, continued its mobilisation exercise with a mega rally in Ozoro, Isoko North Local Council.  The Presiding Judge, Justice Taiwo Taiwo, July 7, ruled that Oborevwori was not qualified to participate in the exercise, let alone be declared the winner, having supplied false information and submitted forged credentials/certificates.  He enthused: “I heard some people saying that PDP is dying in Delta State and I wonder why they are deceiving themselves. We are not boasting, our people will come out and vote in the next election. We are going to win all available seats from the assembly to the presidential election. 
   
“In 2019, they got two local government areas, but in 2023, we will win the entire 25 local government areas. 
  
On his part, the state Chairman of the party, Chief Kingsley Esiso, urged the party faithful to remain calm, adding that INEC had asked stakeholders to maintain calm until the entire court process was exhausted.
