The National Examinations Council (NECO) said there will be a free examination week starting from July 8 to July 13. “The National Examinations Council (NECO) wishes to state that it has not scheduled any examination for Saturday 9th July, 2022,” NECO spokesperson Azeez Sani, said in a statement “This is contrary to insinuations in some quarters that the Council has scheduled examination for 9th July 2022, which is Sallah Day (Eid- Adha). “Conscious of the importance of religious festivals, the Council has always made adequate provision for such in fixing examination dates. “The Council has given a whole examination free week, beginning from Friday, 8th July to Wednesday, 13th July, 2022 in the On-going Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) for School based candidates to enable Muslim faithful have enough time to celebrate the festival. “It would be recalled that the 2022 Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) for School based Candidates commenced on 27th June, and will end on 12th August, 2022.” The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) had urged NECO to shift its examination date because it coincides with the first day of the eid-el-Adha (Sallah) celebration. Sani said NECO is conscious of the importance of religious festivals and has made adequate provision for such in fixing examination dates.
