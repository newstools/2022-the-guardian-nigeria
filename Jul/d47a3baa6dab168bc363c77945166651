Senate Panel on Public Accounts has uncovered an alleged $5 million legal fee paid by officials of Nigerian Maritime and Safety Agency (NIMASA) to a law firm for service not rendered. Chairman of the committee, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, who expressed dissatisfaction over failure on the part of NIMASA to appear before the panel, said lawmakers have no other option but issue a warrant of arrest on the Director General of NIMASA. He said: “The committee has invited NIMASA for the third time to render explanation on payment of $5 million as professional fee and details of $9.3 billion loss by the Federal government. But the agency declined the invitation.” A report of the Auditor General indicated that efforts to see details of the $9.3 billion loss were not granted by NIMASA.
