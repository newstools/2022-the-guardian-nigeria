A middle-aged man, Emeka Mba, yesterday, escaped death by whiskers when a two-storey building collapsed at 15, Oke Arin Street, Ilupeju Palmgroove area of Lagos. Debris of the collapsed building.  A friend of a resident, Biola Safari said: “I was on chat with my friend yesterday and he suddenly went offline, minutes later, he chatted with me to inform me of the incident.  So, I called all the emergency numbers of Lagos State, including 716, 112 and all LASEMA numbers , but none of them picked, I called for almost 30 minutes before I gave up.
 
“I thank God that residents of the street came to the rescue of the people living there.”  MEANWHILE, a resident has drawn the attention of Lagos State Building Control Agency (LABSCA) to the Mushin, Ilupeju and Onipanu areas of the state as there are other buildings that are old like the collapsed one that might cave in anytime soon.
