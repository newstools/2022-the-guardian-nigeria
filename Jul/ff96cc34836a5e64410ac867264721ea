Wrestling legend, The Undertaker, has expressed delight in Israel Adesanya’s choice of ‘The Deadman’ as the theme of his entrance in last weekend’s UFC 276 main event against Jared Canonier, reports comicbook.com. Adesanya defeated Canonier via a split decision to retain his UFC Middleweight title. And the WWE Hall of Famer loved the tribute, saying, “I thought it was great. He’s not only a great fighter, he’s an awesome entertainer as well. Tyson Fury gets knocked down and sits up like the UT and Adesanya uses my walkout. Pretty damn cool.” The Undertaker, also known as ‘The Phenom,’ was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame back in April and appeared on both nights of WrestleMania 38. He officially retired from in-ring competition back in 2020 at the end of his The Last Ride documentary. He is currently working on a one-man show that will hold during SummerSlam weekend and has signed on to start a podcast.
