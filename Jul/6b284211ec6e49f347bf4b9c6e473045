Justice Mojisola Dada of a Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, has sentenced a United Kingdom (UK) ex-convict, Ahmed Soetan to a year imprisonment for defrauding Radisson Blu Hotel of N4.4 million. The trial judge sentenced Soetan after he pleaded guilty to a one-count amended charge of obtaining by false pretence brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The EFCC had alleged that the Commission received a report from the hotel sometime in December 2020 that the defendant, who had lodged in their facility, off and on, made payments through credit cards and American Express in favour of the hotel and the payments were recalled by the unified payment system. However, Justice Dada in a judgement yesterday, found him guilty as charged and sentenced the defendant to a one-year jail term The judge also gave him an option fine of N2 million and ordered the convict to restitute the sum of N4 million, which must be paid within four months. The court further ordered that all items recovered from him be fortified by the Federal Government.
