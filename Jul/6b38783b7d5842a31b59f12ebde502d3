Understanding that women in technology would need to position themselves properly to maximize global shift, Wentors is preparing women in technology for the multicultural and multiracial future of work.
   
A global community of women in technology led by EduAbasi Chukwunweike and Unoma Adeyemi, Wentors said it is committed to increasing the rate of women’s participation and retention in technology through mentorship. With organisations emphasising a multicultural work environment that cuts across borders and the development of talent pipelines across several regions in Africa and the Middle East (MEA), women in tech find themselves on the doorstep of a world of numerous possibilities.
   
Creating a ripple effect in women’s development and empowerment through their mentorship programme, Wentors recently innovated a new mentorship model for women of colour across MEA.  The mentorship program specifically designed for women across both regions will see a group of five mentees paired up with mentors from other regions of the world.
  
According to the founders, it is also an opportunity for women in senior positions with more than four years of experience to give back to other women and also help build the next generation of women in technology.
