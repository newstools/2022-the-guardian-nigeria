This was remarked by the 63-year-old at Olu Jacobs’ 80th birthday celebration on Sunday at Lagos’ Glover Memorial Hall. While praising the actor for his acting abilities, Patience Ozokwo said she missed him on set and his ability to play any part. “I’m missing him on set, he can play an Igbo king, he can play a Yoruba king, in fact, I don’t think anybody can replace him,” she said. At Jacob’s birthday party over the weekend, Hilda Dokubo, Ali Baba, Taiwo Ajayi Lycett, Victor Osuagwu, Ego Boyo, Ireti Doyle, Ini Edo, Kunle Afolayan, and Ngozi Nwosu all made appearances. Remember that Joke Silva disclosed that her husband has dementia and that it has been difficult for her and the rest of the family in an interview with Chude Jideonwo sometime in November 2021.
