• Petrol subsidy nears N6.7tr
• Fiscal deficit exceeds N3tr in four months
• 78 per cent of FG’s spending goes into debt payment, personnel cost
• Fresh modalities for NNPC’s remittance to FAAC underway
• Labour, governors agree on subsidy removal behind ‘closed-doors’, says Agba
• NMDPRA blames rising global energy costs for price instability Hard times are already here for the Federal Government, hard, as its debt servicing exceeded retained revenue by as much as N310 billion in the first four months of 2022. This is the first time the country’s debt service to revenue ratio would hit or exceed 100 per cent.  While giving updates on the budget performance, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, said urgent action is required to address revenue underperformance and expenditure efficiency at national and sub-national levels.  The government spent N4.72 trillion, which was about four-fifth of the N5.77 trillion spending estimate for the period. The expenditure was about 190 per cent higher than the earned revenue.
   
The data also showed that debt servicing alone took as much as 41 per cent of the total spending, while personnel cost (including pensions) was approximately 27 per cent or N1.26 trillion, leaving a meagre N773.6 billion for capital expenditure (CAPEX) or 16 per cent.  MEANWHILE, the continuous rise in energy costs in the global market may have pushed subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) for 2023 to an estimated N6.72 trillion, Ahmed said during the MTEF and FSP presentation. 
  
She disclosed that petrol subsidy payments grew by 349.42 per cent from N350 billion in 2019 to N1.573 trillion in 2021, propelled by the rising price of crude oil in the international market and the falling value of the naira.
   
The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) blamed the current price instability of petroleum products on the global energy crisis.  He added: “This goes for vessels used for shipping of PMS, which has moved from $18,000 per day to $38,000 for Lagos area and $50,000 to Calabar. The rising energy prices have led to higher costs of operations globally. Nigeria is not an island. Whatever happens in the global arena also affects Nigeria.”
   
Recall that the cost of subsidising PMS in 2020 was N450 billion, which grew to N4.19 trillion in the 2022 budget.  The Minister clarified that NNPC that formally transited to a private limited company on Tuesday has not been privatised. Asked how the Federal Government would get the new NNPC Limited to make its due remittances to the Federation Account, Ahmed said the government was in talks with the oil company on the modalities for a convenient model for it to appropriately remit government revenues. She added that NNPC has not remitted revenue into the Federation Account for eight months, because it has been paying subsidies on behalf of the Federal Government.  The Minister’s position goes completely against President Buhari’s stance on petrol subsidy removal. Last month, the President while defending the government’s decision to keep paying fuel subsidies in a response to Bloomberg, said the effects of removing fuel subsidies would be too harsh on the Nigerian people. He said the government is working on boosting local capacity to stem the inflationary pressures that are likely going to be triggered by the removal of subsidies. “Most western countries are today implementing fuel subsidies. Why would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!” he said. THE MTEF and FSP 2023 to 2025 project FG’s revenue at N6.34 trillion, out of which only N373.17 billion or 5.9 per cent comes from oil-related sources. The balance of N5.97 trillion is to be earned from non-oil sources.
   
In addition to subsidy reform, scenario two assumes an aggressive implementation of cost-to-income limits of GOEs, with these, the 2023 FG’s revenue is projected at N8.46 trillion (15.1 per cent or N1.51 trillion less than the 2022 Budget) but N2.12 trillion more than scenario one. Of this, N1.99 trillion or 23.6 per cent, is projected to come from oil-related sources, while the balance is to be earned from non-oil sources.
   
The FG’s 2023 aggregate expenditure is estimated at N16.98 trillion, which is N337.05 billion (1.9 per cent) lower than the 2022 budget. The sums of N20.29 trillion and N22.73 trillion are projected to be spent by the FGN in 2024 and 2025, respectively.  “Upward pressure on prices is expected to be driven by the current and lag effect of the global price surge due to the Russian-Ukraine war, domestic insecurity, rising costs of imports, exchange rate depreciation, as well as other supply-side constraints. The medium-term nominal consumption is projected at N121.93 trillion, N123.69 trillion and N125.45 trillion for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively,” it said.
