 Paul and Anita Okoye Another storm is brewing in Paul Okoye’s marriage to Anita, the other half of the pop duo P-Square. Anita started divorce procedures in an Abuja High Court, according to court documents that are making the rounds online. Some exchanges between Paul and other women he reportedly had affairs with are among the documents that Anita is said to have submitted. Paul was supposedly seeing their cleaner Florence, according to allegations made by Anita. She continued by saying that on June 11, 2020, Paul evicted her and her sister when she found out about the extramarital relationship. Anita further asserted that the famous musician had not shown a keen interest in the discipline or raising of their kids. This was said even as she mentioned that she founded a business named TannkCo in 2019 and that she provided Paul N10 million to build a mall that would also function as TannkCo’s office. She asserted that Paul broke their agreement by failing to give her any space in the mall. Remember that the marriage has had difficulties before Anita filed for divorce in August 2021. Then she claimed that her acts were motivated by irreconcilable disputes. After purportedly dating for ten years, the couple married in 2014, and they are now parents to three children .
