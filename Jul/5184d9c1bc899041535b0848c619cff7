In response to that, Lucy said “The price of fame! The most annoying of it being that dating someone is harder! You don’t know who is just coming to get famous or drag you down. Crazy Sh!t.” The 32-year-old also emphasised the downside of fame when she said that the “most annoying” aspect of being famous is being in relationships. Lucy Edet is the CEO of Lucianas Grill, the cooking side of her she revealed when Big Brother Naija season 5 aired. Lucy Edet has been open about her fears about dating, and marriage and also mentioned the possibility of settling into being a single mother, given the challenges of dating as a celebrity.
