What came off as smooth delivery of the zoning arrangement in Enugu State has suddenly dovetailed into a zigzag. Dr. Peter Mbah had emerged as the winner of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary by defeating the other seven aspirants. The losers, including the first runner-up, Hon. Chijioke Edeoga, congratulated Mbah and pledged to work with him to usher in the greater development of the state.
   
But, barely three weeks after the gesture of sportsmanship and pledge towards unity, things have fallen apart as entrenched political interests in the state move to challenge what was seen as a possible coronation of Mbah as the next governor.
      
For the past 22 years, PDP has been holding sway as the sole determinant of the political dynamics of the state. Facilitating that dominance of Enugu State politics through continuous electoral triumphs is the religious observance of the power rotation scheme, otherwise called zoning, among the three senatorial districts of Enugu East, Enugu West and Enugu North.  IT could be recalled that weeks before the governorship primary, Ekweremadu and his supporters queried the conduct of the delegates’ election, even as they alleged violent attacks on them. To drive home their angst, supporters of the former DSP approached the Federal High Court Abuja seeking to overturn the April 30 delegates election.
   
Having failed to get the court’s favourable order, the DSP group organised a parallel congress that threw up its own lineup of aspirants. But, the Senator had to announce a sudden change of mind after opening discussions with the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), ostensibly to absorb his group.
  
Yet, in a curious twist, the state chairman of APC, who was a Commissioner of Works in the administration of Governor Chimaroke Nnamani, Chief Ugochukwu Agballah, called a world press conference, where he not only upbraided Ekweremadu but also described his aspiration for governorship as malevolent.
