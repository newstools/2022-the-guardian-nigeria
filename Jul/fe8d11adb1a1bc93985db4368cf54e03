An Abuja-based lawyer, Osigwe Momoh has sued the All Progressive Congress (APC) at a Federal High Court Abuja for fielding the president and vice-president candidates of the party from the same religion for the 2023 election. Osigwe has requested a perpetual injunction from the court to restrain the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) from publishing the candidate of the APC as a presidential candidate for the forthcoming 2023 general elections.

The plaintiff argued that the decision to pick the party’s presidential flagbearer and the running mate from the same religion (section) violates the principle of the Nigeria Constitution. “By virtue of Sections 14 -1,3, and 15 and 224(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), the defendants are bound by the principles of Chapter II of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), and having the presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the same religion is unconstitutional, null and void,” Momoh said. “That all Political Parties must, by virtue of chapter two of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), have their presidential and vice presidential candidates from different sectional (tribal and religious) groups of the nation. “An order nullifying the candidacy of the APC, Tinubu (1st And 2nd), same being unconstitutional and against the spirit and letters of Sections 14 (1) & (3), 15 and 224 (a) of the amended 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” This suit came after APC’s presidential candidate, Tinubu unveiled Senator Kashim Shettima as his vice-presidential candidate last week Wednesday. Meanwhile, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.
