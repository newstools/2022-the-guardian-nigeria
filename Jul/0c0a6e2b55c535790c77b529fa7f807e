Cautions them against competing with chairmen Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has inaugurated the newly-appointed Governor’s Local Government Liaison Officers, with a warning not to compete with their local council chairmen, but rather to complement them to serve the people at the grassroots better. Abiodun, while speaking at the inauguration ceremony at the Oba’s Complex in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, said as the closest to the grassroots, the liaison officers have a duty to work closely with their council bosses by championing the course of development at the local communities and ensure that the people get the dividends of democracy. He further warned them not to see their appointments as a means of corruptly enriching themselves from the public treasury, noting that as an administration that prides itself in upholding transparency and probity, it would not hesitate to relieve those found wanting of their appointments. The governor, while calling on the appointees to brace themselves for the tasks ahead, urged them to contribute their quota towards the realisation of the ISEYA mantra. He solicited the support of the people, saying: “The new appointees were chosen from the pool of highly-qualified indigenes of the state taking into consideration variables like fairness, justice, equity and truthfulness.” Abiodun, who reiterated that the appointees were to serve as a feedback mechanism through a two-way communication process between the government and the people, enjoined them to justify the confidence reposed in them by demonstrating the ability to ride above situations and challenges while also remaining loyal to the cause of serving humanity. He said that their performance would be reviewed regularly to ensure that the government, not only maintain but also improve its level of performance generally. Besides, he said that his administration would continue to provide an enhancing and conducive environment for a participatory government where mutual love, trust and cooperation exist.
