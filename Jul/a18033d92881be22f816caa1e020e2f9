According to Page Six, a source informed them that Alwyn popped the question months ago, but only their closest friends and family were informed. The source said “Basically immediate family, and trusted, very old friends. Everyone has been sworn to secrecy, too.” “Again, only a handful of people know details about the wedding and Taylor hasn’t even told some of her team about the engagement.” “They want their love to stay away from the cameras as much as possible. This is just for them. And if and when they do exchange vows, there most definitely won’t be any Vogue, Rolling Stone, or Hello! magazines there. It will be simple and elegant – like them.” Swift and Alwyn have been dating since 2017 and while they maintain privacy, she has constantly acknowledged his contributions towards her career.
