Produced by Eardrumz and DTAC, ‘Say You Bad (Remix)’ is the first taste of what to expect from Skales’ upcoming Sweet Distractions deluxe album, and the single also comes with a captivating music video directed by Gorilla Boy, who has also worked with the likes of Rema, Naira Marley, and Reekado Banks, among others. Arriving just in time for summer and for the festival season, ‘Say You Bad (Remix)’ is an instant dance floor filler and will surely be a crowd-favourite on his upcoming European tour, with its infectious upbeat drum patterns, synth chords, and machine-altered alto melodies, over which Skales waxes lyrical about how beautiful African women are, while showing off his catchy flow, sing-along lyrics, and captivating vocal delivery. Rising star and ‘No Wahala’ crooner 1da Banton brings the glorious dance track home, with a melodic and lyrical masterclass of his own. With over 150 million plays online, five critically acclaimed projects that have given us hits such as ‘Shake Body’ and ‘Temper’, as well as international collaborations with the likes of Major Lazer, Nicki Minaj and Burna Boy under his belt, Skales is one of Africa’s most treasured music heavyweights, with his own unique sound that has found the perfect medium between afrobeats and electronic dance music. The award-winning star is also one of the continent’s most travelled pop stars, having performed in over 20 countries across the world in the last two years.
