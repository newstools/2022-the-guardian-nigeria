The cast of the period romance drama is hard at work for season three, and this time, there are new additions. Recall that earlier, Netflix had revealed that the new season follows the love story between Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton). Cast members confirmed working hard on the new season in a production BTS video shared on the series’ official Instagram account. The caption read, “Spy the makings of a new social season. By the looks of things, it would seem the third installment of Bridgerton is officially underway.”   A post shared by Bridgerton (@bridgertonnetflix) News outlets report the addition of new actors-Daniel Francis, Sam Phillips and James Phoon. Francis will play Marcus Debling, a charismatic gentleman and member of the ton. Phillips will play Lord Debling, while Phoon will play a character known as Dankworth. Season three also has a new showrunner Jess Brownwell who had worked as a writer and producer on the last two seasons of the series. Brownell replaced Chris Van Dusen, who announced his exit in March after two seasons. In Season 3, Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) gives up her crush on Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) after hearing him speak about her to his friends in season 2. Instead, she turns to find a husband who will respect her independence, allowing her to continue her double life as Lady Whistledown, away from her mother and sisters. The new plot for season three takes a different turn from the book series. The book’s third novel focuses on Benedict Bridgerton and the surprising love he finds. Back in May, the film’s new plot was confirmed by Penelope actress Nicola Coughlan who shared a photo of her posing with Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton) on her Instagram account.   A post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan) The caption read, “Like Lady Whistledown I’ve been keeping quite a big secret for quite a long time… but I can finally tell you that @bridgertonnetflix Season Three is Colin and Penelope’s Story.” Season 2 of the series released in March 2022 followed the love story between Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Shame.
