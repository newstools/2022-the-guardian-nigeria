Amidst cries by farmers that they are unable to go to the farm due to frequent attacks by herdsmen, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr Mohammad Abubakar yesterday, assured that the Federal Government will not allow the insecurity situation in the country to affect food production. He also assured that the government will deploy agro rangers across the country to protect the farmers while on the field. Farmers had complained that the agro rangers who are mostly members of the Nigerian Security Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) do not have the capacity to protect them while on the farm. The Minister, while speaking at the 4th Women Enterprise Alliance Conference yesterday, in Abuja, said “Government is doing all it can to address the situation and I can assure you that we will not allow insecurity to affect food production. “As you can see, food is still being produced in the country and we will make sure it does not stop because of what is currently happening.” Speaking on the theme of the 2-day conference “Rethinking Paradigm Shift in Agriculture and initiative to enhance food security, the Minister regretted that Nigeria moved away from agriculture to crude oil. He said if the country had not moved away, it could have been a giant of giants given her numerous potentials. The Convener of the conference, Aisha Babangida pointed out that the conference was organised to point out the importance of agriculture and spread awareness among Nigerians to support the agricultural activities, advancement of technology and devise a realistic roadmap for the sector.
