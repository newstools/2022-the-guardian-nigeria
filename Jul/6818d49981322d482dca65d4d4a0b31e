Bali experiences a rainy season and a dry season, but the heat and humidity never go away, which makes it a perfect place to travel for your summer holiday. Bahasa Indonesia (also called Indonesian) is commonly spoken in Bali, but Balinese is a separate language. People in Bali generally learn Balinese as their first language, but many now use Bahasa. Here are some of the beautiful places to visit in Bali:
1. The sea of marigolds: Marigolds fields are one of the most beautiful places in Bali. They are important in Balinese culture these golden blooms are used during all important ceremonies. Although they are grown in areas across Bali’s highlands with plenty or small golden fields lining the roadsides, head towards Besakih, between Kintamani and Bedugul for jaw-dropping marigold fields. The fields here stretch for miles, creating a golden horizon that glitters in the Bali sunshine. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1816491 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-901x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="850" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-901x598.jpg 901w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-1536x1020.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-320x212.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-640x425.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali.-600x398.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-infinity-pool-at-the-hanging-gardens-of-Bali..jpg 1654w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />

3. The sunrise view atop Mount Batur: Mount Batur is one of Bali’s spectacular active volcanoes and is easily the most popular trip for a sunrise high.

By the time you reach the highest peak, the sun would just be rising, which is when the beauty of this island adventure unfolds. You will realize you are right above the cloud, with Bali’s volcanic earthquakes glimmering a golden hue below. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1816492 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Bambu-Indah-Ubud-Bali.-Photo-Alina-Vlasova-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
