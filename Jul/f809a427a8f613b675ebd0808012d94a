Seplat Energy Plc has recorded a half-year revenue of $527 million from $308.8 million year-on-year, with a dividend of $2.5 cents per share declared.  “We remain confident that our transformational acquisition of Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU) will be approved, adding significant reserves and production capacity that will strongly reinforce Seplat Energy’s position as Nigeria’s leading indigenous oil and gas producer.    
   
“We have recently launched a roadmap for decarbonisation, with a clear path to ending routine flaring by 2024. In addition, our ‘Tree for Life’ initiative will plant five million saplings to sequester carbon across five states. All of these initiatives demonstrate our strategic commitment to build a sustainable company that delivers energy transition for the benefit of all Nigerians,” he stated. 
   
He said the company expects would drill four additional oil wells in the coming quarter to arrest decline and support production growth across the asset base, complete ongoing projects, invest in maintenance capex to secure the existing assets and continue investments in gas.
