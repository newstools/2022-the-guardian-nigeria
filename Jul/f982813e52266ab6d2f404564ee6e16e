Borno Youths International Congress (BOYIC) has pledged support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential running mate, Kashim Shettima. Presidential candidate of APC, Bola Tinubu, chose Shettima as running mate, a development that is threatening to tear the party into shreds, with notable party chieftains leaving the party with their supporters. According to BOYIC, the Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket is a “win master stroke” against the opposition political parties in the country. Announcing their support, yesterday, at a news conference in Maiduguri, the Chairman, Muktar Gubio, disclosed that the emergence of Shettima as Tinubu’s running mate was a strategy to sweep the forthcoming general elections in the North. While congratulating Shettima, he said: “We wish to join millions of Nigerians in congratulating our resourceful Shettima on his nomination to be the vice presidential candidate of APC.” He described the nomination of the former governor and serving senator as the best choice made by the party since 2014. Shettima has exhibited the capacity and commitment to transform the country and the living condition of the people, he added. Gubio expressed confidence that the vice presidential candidate would employ his wealth of experience at the national level if elected in 2023. He thanked Tinubu for choosing Shettima to be his running mate.
