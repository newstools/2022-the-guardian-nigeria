Terrorists who abducted the Abuja-Kaduna train passengers have threatened to abduct and kill both President Muhammadu Buhari and Kaduna state governor, Nasir El-Rufai. The terrorists in a video also vowed to continue torturing the victims in their captivity. In a two-minute and sixty seconds video, the terrorists were seen mercilessly weeping the victims with sticks and boasted that they would destroy the country, kill the remaining passengers in their custody and sell out the others.

If you don’t adhere to our demands, we will kill the ones we need to kill and sell the remaining. By God’s grace, El-Rufai, Buhari, we will bring you here.” One of the victims, who did not mention his name, called on the international communities to come to their rescue and accused the Federal Government of negligence. “These people (Terrorists) were ready to release us even a week after the incident, but Government refused to meet their demands. we are calling on France, England, and other international communities like UN, and AU to come to our rescue,” the captive said.
