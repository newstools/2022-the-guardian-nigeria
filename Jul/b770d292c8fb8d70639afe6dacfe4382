An erstwhile presidential aspirant on the African Democratic Congress (ADC) platform, Dr. Favour Ayodele, yesterday, tendered his resignation letter from the party, alleging that the primary that produced founder of Roots Television, Dumebi Kachikwu, as winner of the contest, was faulty. The party’s National Chairman, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, confirmed receiving the correspondence, but quickly added that the resignation letters of all aggrieved aspirants had been accepted. “The reconciliation committee is still approaching them to rescind their decisions,” he stated. Moghalu has since resigned his membership, faulting the same process that produced Dumebi as the party’s flag-bearer for the 2023 presidential election at the primary that held in Abeokuta, Ogun State. In the correspondence addressed to the ADC chairman, Ayodele, who is Chief Executive Director, The Carpenter Consult, alleged discrepancies in the entire exercise.
