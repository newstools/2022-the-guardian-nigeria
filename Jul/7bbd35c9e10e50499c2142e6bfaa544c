• Hundreds of dealers, and agents to be thrown out of business
• Used cars from China, and Europe not captured on the VIN system
• Dealers fear only Nigerian-used vehicles will be on market soon 
• Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz are not included in the new valuation system
• Importers abandon older cars due to unreasonable duties Hiccups in the vehicle valuation system of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) may hamper the importation of used cars just as thousands of dealers and agents are on the verge of losing their livelihoods, investigations by The Guardian have revealed.  “The value of Mercedes and Corolla are very outrageous, if you are on 846, they use the new template, from 2003 – 2013 the cost is about N2.8 million, as against the N390,000 – N400,000 and most owners now abandon these vehicles, even though consultations and meetings are ongoing to find a solution to this anomaly.
   
“A situation where the duty of common automobiles such as Golf, Toyota Corolla and Matrix has gone up from N500,000, to between N1 million to N1.3 million now, is unacceptable as it has made vehicles unaffordable for ordinary Nigerians,” he said.
  
The Public Relations Officer of Registered Freight Forwarders of Nigeria, Chinedun Ogoke, said the practice where vehicles of the same model, but manufactured in different countries are charged separately frightens importers. He said due to the e-valuation, a vehicle imported at N1 million attracts as much as N2 million to N2.5 million clearing fee.
   
“We have a situation where two different types of evaluations are used on the same type of vehicle and you find a situation where, for example, you import a vehicle of N1 million and you are supposed to clear it with N500,000. But because of valuation, you are now clearing the vehicle with N2.5 million.  He said to clear a Toyota, depending on the model and age, one spends up N1.3 million to N1.4 million, saying: “If you clear these vehicles at such high cost, the selling prices will increase. “The Corolla we used to sell N1.6 million is now N2.7 million. Same with other vehicles. Everything has escalated. And since vehicles depreciate, dealers decide to sell and get their money and stop car business to go look for other businesses to invest in.”  “VIN Valuation doesn’t have values for vehicle models older than 12 years and most 2008 and 2009 vehicles are largely used by Nigerian youths for Uber and other e-hailing services. The implication is that older vehicles will be more expensive in Nigeria. We want the government to review the 12-year policy on used vehicles to 15 years.
 
“There is also a need to review the levies on used vehicles. While we understand the government’s zeal to realise all possible earnings, it will be appropriate to reduce the levy on used vehicles from 15 per cent to five per cent in a bid to ameliorate the sufferings of  Nigerians,” he stated.
