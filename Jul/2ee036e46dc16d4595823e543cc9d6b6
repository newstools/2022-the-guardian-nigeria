An environmentalist and winner of the 2022 Goldman Environmental Prize for Africa, Chima Williams, yesterday, hailed the Federal Government’s commitment to addressing the issues of environmental degradation, pollution and climate change in the country. Williams, who made the commendation during a press conference organised by the Environmental Right Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) in Benin City, Edo State, expressed appreciation to the government, noting that those working in the environment sector are not ignorant of the Federal Government’s positive steps towards addressing issues of environmental challenges. He said: “Some of the positive steps showing assurances on your commitment to addressing the issues of environmental degradation, pollution and climate change are obvious to those working in these sectors. “The clean up of Ogoni land, though very slow at least is a departure from the past where nothing was done at all some years, even after the release of the UNEP Report on the environment situation of Ogoni land with recommendations spanning both short, middle and long term remedial and restoration actions. “Policies, laws governing the issues of petroleum extraction, climate change and others, such as the revised National Determined Contributions pursuant to the Paris Agreement, which includes waste, related issues, the Petroleum Industry Act 2021, the Climate Change Act 2021 etc., are among the positive signs. “Despite the issues arising from these laws, to have mustered the courage to have them passed in the first place for me is a plus for your concern for the Nigerian environment. “ Williams however, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to urgently bring together all the parties including all extractive companies – Shell, ExxonMobil, Nigerian Agip Oil Company, Total Energy and the victims of their operations, relevant government agencies and authorities to discuss workable solutions to the environmental despoliations arising from their operational methodologies in the country.
