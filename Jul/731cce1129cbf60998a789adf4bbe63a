 Portable The Inspector General of Police, Baba Alkali has ordered the Lagos State Police Command to commence an investigation of Nigeria artiste, Habeeb Okikiola aka Portable. This is a sequel to the trending video of the artiste where he claimed to have formed the One-Million Boys cult group terrorising some parts of Lagos State. According to the Force Public Relations Officer (FPRO), CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the IGP ordered the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, to investigate the indicting statement and take necessary legal action. “This directive is premised on the continuous effort of the Nigeria Police Force to fish out pillars and sponsors of cult groups in order to decimate their activities and restore sanity to our society.”
