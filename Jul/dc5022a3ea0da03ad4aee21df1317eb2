The Debt Management Office (DMO) has listed the N250 billion, 10-year 13 per cent Ijarah Sovereign Sukuk due 2031, on Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX). The Ijarah Sovereign Sukuk was successfully listed on NGX, having fulfilled the conditions set by the Financial Regulatory Advisory Council of Experts (FRACE) of the Central Bank of Nigeria, which stipulated that trading in the instrument would only be permissible after the commencement of works on the road projects scheduled for construction through the Sukuk assets. According to the exchange, the listing will facilitate its trading and provide liquidity to investors which would further deepen the Nigerian capital market. The Ijarah Sovereign Sukuk, which was issued on December 29, 2021, would finance the rehabilitation and construction of key economic road projects across the six geopolitical zones in the country. The proceeds of the sukuk will be dedicated to road projects and will enable the government to achieve significant progress in bridging the infrastructure gap in Nigeria. Recall that the DMO listed the N162.6 billion seven-year sukuk with a rental rate of 11.20 per cent on the exchange to be used for financing the rehabilitation and construction of key road projects across the 36 states and the FCT in 2021. NGX added that the issuance and subsequent listing of the sovereign sukuk on the NGX platform underscores the Federal Government’s drive to develop the critical infrastructure needed to unlock economic growth, by leveraging innovative and cost-effective financing structures.
