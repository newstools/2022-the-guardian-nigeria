The presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso, on Saturday, described Igbo nation as politically immature to win the presidency. Kwankwaso, the former governor of Kano State, calculated the ongoing political permutations in the country and declared that the highest Igbo can hope for is vice president. Kwankwaso was in Gombe to inaugurate the NNPP state Secretariat on Bauchi road. Fielding questions from newsmen, the former senator and minister rated Igbo as politically naive, struggling at the nation’s political ladder. Responding to progress on the reported likely merger of his NNPP and the Labour Party (LP) fielding former governor of Anambra State as its candidate, Kwankwaso advised Igbo to learn the rope from Yoruba and the Hausa/Fulani. He said: “I like the Igbo people, they are good and enterprising, but in the game of politics, they’re at the bottom of the ladder and uncertain of their calculations. “Look at it carefully, they had lost out with the PDP and APC completely. The only choice they have now is merger with NNPP, which I took to them. “Believe me, this is an opportunity they have; it is going to be a disaster if they bungle it. Once that happens, they will, again, start to cry of marginalisation and shifting blames to the Yoruba and Hausa/Fulani. “South East must learn how to play politics. Look at South West; it is very strategic. Imagine Bola Tinubu at over 80 years. He is strategic to have agreed to wait for Buhari to go first. “Really, we had talks with the LP for possible merger, but problems started with who is to be the flag bearer. “The Igbo has not realised that their problem is politics that must be tackled politically.”
