On Thursday, during a Q&A session hosted by Ruger on Twitter, a possible Bnxn fan told the “Dior” singer that Bnxn was much better than him. The fan @BNXN001 tweeted, “Lol bnxn is better than you and there’s nothing you can do about it you this low budget Samuel L Jackson” Responding, Ruger noted that while he loves Buju he isn’t better than hm, pointing out that most of his (Buju’s) record hits are features. Ruger wrote, “I love buju he’s good but he’s not better than me. Everything I’ve done since the beginning was only RUGER. All my hits are JUST RUGER. I’m always proud going on stage around the world with my own hits and everyone is singing along. You see the difference?” I love buju he’s good but he’s not better than me. Everything I’ve done since the beginning was only RUGER. All my hits are JUST RUGER. I’m always proud going on stage around the world with my own hits and everyone is singing along. You see the difference? https://t.co/y555GeKqCC — da Ruger gon screw u (@rugerofficial) July 14, 2022 Hopping on the ‘beef’ train, Omah Lay took to Twitter to weigh on the issue. Taking sides with Bnxn, Omah Lay also recalled a former issue with Victony. He wrote, “Ruger get mind dey talk about bnxn like that for this app smh!! mofos do anything for clout out here, same way Victony lol my tweet the other time, y’all are really kids.” Ruger get mind dey talk about bnxn like that for this app smh!! mofos do anything for clout out here, same way Victony lol my tweet the other time, y’all are really kids — Omah Lay (@Omah_Lay) July 15, 2022 While Bnxn is yet to formally address Ruger, he took to Snapchat to share what many fans believe to be his response. He wrote, “Lol I’d have it no other way, i make and keep 100% , you make and keep 50% or less than that, I’ve never begged for a feature , legends that even you respect rate me and my talent over yours r don’t hate the player, hate the game.” “And even tho this numbers game is crazy cause that’s how you think you better ?? JONZER@1 STILL got more numbers than you generally
