While it’s not healthy to drink to the point of a hangover, it wouldn’t hurt to have remedies for curing your hangover on days you drink past your limit. Hangovers are caused by excessive alcohol consumption, more than your body can safely process. The liver considers alcohol a toxin and works hard to remove it from your system; however, excessive alcohol consumption can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, nutrient depletion and low blood sugar. Hangover symptoms include Natural Remedies For Hangovers The best natural hangover remedies cater to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and low blood sugar, the three major hangover symptoms. These remedies provide fast relief from the unpleasantness of hangovers and get you back on your feet in no time. Eating a nutritious, hearty breakfast is one of the first and easiest remedies to try for curing a hangover. Low blood sugar aggravates the symptoms of hangover in individuals. Hence, to cure a hangover, you’ll need to eat a hearty, protein-rich breakfast to restore your blood sugar levels and other nutrients that may have been depleted from consuming too much alcohol. So, your hangover remedy diet should include eggs, avocado, whole-grain toast with butter, bananas and sweet potatoes. Rehydrating your body is an essential part of curing a hangover. Drinking some coconut water rehydrates you even faster as it’s rich in electrolytes, and electrolyte imbalance is one of the primary causes of hangover symptoms. It doesn’t have to be coconut water; an ordinary glass of water would also suffice. Sweating detoxifies the body naturally and helps greatly to rid the body of alcohol-related toxins. Going outside for a quick walk or jog would stimulate your heart, increasing blood and oxygen circulation while alleviating your hangover symptoms. Green juice is a well-known detoxifier, and drinking a glass after a night out gives your liver a much-needed boost. Be sure to include veggies like spinach, kale, parsley, lemon, and ginger—all great natural detoxifiers. You should also drink some grapefruit juice or beet juice to cleanse your liver. The only way to drink is to drink safely, not until you black out. Pace yourself, making sure to drink water in between drinks.
