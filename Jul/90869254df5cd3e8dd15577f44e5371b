However, she needs Gerard Piqué’s permission in order for Milan and Sasha to leave Spain, and the football player will most likely say no. The primary news surrounding Shakira and Piqué’s impending divorce is the Barcelona football player’s alleged infidelity. However, the only fact that can be confirmed is that a difficult custody dispute over their children is anticipated. The Colombian celebrity will reportedly do everything it takes to achieve her goal of living in Miami with her two children, even creating a report that would not put the athlete in a favourable position, according to information made public by the portal Informalia. But Piqué won’t let them leave the nation, not even for a short trip. A source informed the press stating that “Shakira is not going to stop until she manages to move to Miami and take the children with her. That is her main goal. But she can’t without Piqué’s consent, and he won’t give it. Not even for a few days of vacation.” The footballer does not intend to live where his compatriot Nicolas Vallejo-Nagera Colate, who married Paulina Rubio and fathered a son, did not want to be an absentee father after the divorce with the singer and moved to live in Miami, the footballer continues, according to this person close to the footballer’s environment.
