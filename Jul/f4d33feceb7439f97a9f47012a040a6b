Former MFM striker, Stephen Odey, who currently plays for Denmark’s Randers, has confirmed he would be ‘open’ to a Glasgow Celtic or Rangers move this summer as speculation surrounds his future. According to Glasgowlive.co.uk, Odey has been linked with a move away from the Danish club with many teams said to be pursuing his services. He netted 13 times in 32 appearances for Randers, while he has also had spells at Zurich, Amiens and Genk. There were reports earlier last month that Rangers and Celtic were among suitors for the two-cap star. Then Randers chiefs refused to deny interest overall in recent statements after claims Ibrox sporting director Ross Wilson had held ‘preliminary discussions.’ Capped twice by his country, the forward himself has now spoken about his own future in a media appearance over in Denmark. He told Randers Amtsavis about Celtic and Rangers interest: “These are big clubs, and it is clear that this is something that I want to be open to. “But I’m in Randers FC, and right now that’s the only thing that matters. As long as I have not been presented with anything concrete, as I said, I will not let myself be disturbed by it. “If the right club comes, Randers FC has no choice but to let me go. But I am happy to be in Randers FC, and that does not change the fact that there are some rumours about other clubs. “For me, it’s about the preparations for the new season with the team I’m part of.” Celtic boss, Ange Postecoglou, has made five permanent signings so far this summer, while Rangers counterpart, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, has only captured Scotland’s defender, John Souttar, so far.
