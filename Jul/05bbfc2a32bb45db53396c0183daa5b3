The 25-year-old rapper had been pulled over due to illegal window tinting, and after cops smelled marijuana in the vehicle, they conducted a stop and search. Breaking the news, TMZ reports that officers claimed to have discovered 31 oxycodone pills in the rapper’s vehicle. Asides from the large amounts of the drug found in the car, officers also found $74,960 in cash. Oxycodone is a narcotic drug prescribed to treat severe pain and can be highly addictive. It could also lead to respiratory issues and death if taken in high doses. Kodak received two charges, including possession of a controlled substance with no prescription and also drug trafficking of oxycodone. Following the search, he was reportedly taken to Broward County Jail in Ft. Lauderdale. TMZ also reports that asides from claims of illegal window tinting, the “Super Gremlin” singer’s license and tags were expired. Kodak Black has had regular run-ins with the law; back in January, he was arrested for trespassing in Pompano Beach, Florida. He has faced several on and off charges, including possession of a firearm, robbery, falsifying information on legal documents, false imprisonment, violation of probation, and one sexual assault charge, to mention a few.
