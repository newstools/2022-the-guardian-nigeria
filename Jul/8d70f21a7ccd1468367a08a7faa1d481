To ensure a conducive and secured environment for learning, the Lagos State Government has through its Special Committee on Rehabilitation of Public School (SCRPS) unveiled digitised container classrooms at Vetland Junior Grammar School, Agege.
 
Chairman of SCRPS, Mr. Hakeem Smith, said the committee, established in 2004 by the Senator Bola Tinubu-led administration, as an intervention body has made giant strides in addressing infrastructural challenges in Lagos public schools.
  
Each of the classroom compartment is adequately-insulated to give comfort and create a conducive ambience for hybrid learning for children in public secondary school.  He said: “You have a duty to take good care of  everything that has been made available to you, so that future  generations can enjoy them as well.	   
 
Congratulating  all 620 pupils who are the  pioneer beneficiaries of this state-of-the-art school., the governor said they deserved  to  receive the best quality of education available, to prepare them for life  and work in the 21st century.
 
He said: “ Seven months ago, I commissioned an ultra-modern 18-classroom block, with state-of-the-art sporting facilities, at Elemoro  Comprehensive Junior Secondary School, Ibeju-Lekki.
