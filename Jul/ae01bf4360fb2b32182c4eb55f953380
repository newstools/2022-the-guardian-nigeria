Scores of imported vehicles are currently trapped at the Five-Star Logistics Terminal in TinCan Island port following the Nigeria Customs Service blockade of the exit access over unpaid debt amounting to about N97.3 million.  “We wish to inform our members that ANLCA is on top of this issue and we are saddened about the development. However, we shall give the terminal operator between now and next Tuesday to resolve their issue with Nigeria Customs Service, if not, we will be taking them to court for breach of agreement and failure to deliver these cargoes to the importers representative.
   
“Also, Five Star should know that it will be responsible for all demurrages and storage charges that may accrue within this period (July 6 to date).
   
“Finally, we urge our members to be calm and law-abiding and I will advise we keep the receipts of all payments during this period,” he stated.
