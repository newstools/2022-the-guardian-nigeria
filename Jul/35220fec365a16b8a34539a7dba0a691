• Announces 2022 UTME high flyers, minister stresses quality education Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), yesterday, said it will no longer consider National Business and Technical Education Board (NABTEB) A’ level results for direct entry into tertiary institutions. The Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, said: “ The honourable Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, has approved that the NABTEB A’Level GCE will no longer be recognised as a qualification for DE (Direct Entry) from 2022. However, all those who have already obtained it prior to this date will be able to use it.” This is even as he released names of the best students in the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). Oloyede, said an Ekiti indigene, Adebayo Eyimofe, came tops with 362 marks, adding that he was closely followed by Ugwu Chikelu, from Enugu State, with a 359 score. The duo wrote the test in one of the computer-based centres in Abuja. Other high scorers include Igbalaye Ebunoluwa, 357; Emmanuel Oluwanifemi, 357; Ozumba Samuel, 357; Olumide-Attah Ayomide, 355; Lawal Olaoluwa, 355; Dokun Jubril, 354; Amaku Anthony, 354 and Aghulor Divine, 353. BESIDES, the board announced 140 and 100 cut-off marks for universities, polytechnics and colleges of education for the 2022/2023 academic session. Oloyede, after a stakeholders’ meeting, said the implication “is that every institution has the right to fix its own cut-off mark even up to 220, but no one would be allowed to go less than the agreed minimum marks of 100 for colleges of education, 100 for polytechnics and 140 for universities.” The JAMB boss observed that only 378,639 of the 1,761,338, who wrote the 2022 UTME, scored 200 and above. While giving further statistics, OloyedE said 378,639 scored over 200 marks; 520,596 recordings 190 and above; 704,991 attained 180 and beyond; 934,103 scored 170 and above and 1,192, 057 achieved 160 and beyond. He said the organisation allowed candidates awaiting results to register for the examinations. The minister, Adamu, urged tertiary institutions to adhere strictly to extant regulations by the National Universities Commission (NUC), National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and National Commission for Colleges of Education (NCCE). SIMILARLY, Minister of State for Education, Goodluck Opiah, has stressed that the Nigerian child must be prepared for future challenges by equipping him/her with quality education. Speaking when he received Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) Executive Secretary, Dr. Hamid Bobboyi and his management team in Abuja, the newly appointed minister lauded the commission for contributing toward functional and quality education in Nigeria.
