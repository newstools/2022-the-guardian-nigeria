The Albino Foundation has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to speed up the arrangement of procurement and usage of magnifying glasses for persons with Albinism in the 2023 general elections. Founder of Albino Foundation Jake Epelle stated this in a statement in Abuja, saying such gadgets were effectively deployed, and many of its members used them during the voting procedure in the just concluded Osun Governorship Election. Epelle added, “This is the most inclusive election with priority voting for Persons with Disabilities and the provision of Braille ballot papers for the blind. INEC should engage us to ensure a quality product that meets global standards. “We’re glad the electoral body took particular interest in the usage of the glasses and tweeted its use by a gentleman with albinism. This development assures us that the 2023 polls will be conducted in the same way.” Epelle therefore called for continuous training by the INEC Adhoc staff to ensure compliance in the future, adding, we observed that some polling units were placed on the high ground, making them inaccessible to persons with disabilities. He commended Prof. Mahmud Yakubu, INEC Chairman and staff, and the people of Osun State for “effectively carrying out the most inclusive poll in Nigeria’s history” while congratulating the governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke.
