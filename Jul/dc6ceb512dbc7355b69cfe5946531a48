The Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), yesterday, expressed worries over incessant theft and vandalisation of telecommunication infrastructures across the country. The commission said the persistent challenges consumers were experiencing while making calls were mostly caused by the destruction and/or vandalisation of telecommunication infrastructure. Speaking in Ibadan during a Village Square Dialogue, a telecoms consumer outreach programme organised by the commission to sensitise the grassroots, the NCC Chairman, Prof. Adeolu Akande, emphasised the need to protect telecommunication infrastructure.
 
He said without proper and functioning telecom infrastructure, “to communicate with families in long distances as well banking, finance, education and entertainment would be hard.”  “We are here in Ibadan to discuss one of the most important issues affecting the protection of telecom infrastructure; telecom infrastructure is important and we must ensure we take it as critical national infrastructure. “We need the cooperation of members of the public and consumers to protect the infrastructures. We are doing this across the country to seek the support of Nigerians and telecommunication service providers.”
