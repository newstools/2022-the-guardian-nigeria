Anthony Joshua has warned that he could throw away the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight world titles if he regains them from Oleksandr Usyk in their rematch, reports talksport.com. The Ukrainian dethroned the Briton last year and the pair are now set to meet again on August 20 in Saudi Arabia. Many felt AJ was too passive in the first fight and failed to use his natural advantages, such as size and strength to overcome Usyk. In conversation with JD Sports, Joshua was told his fans will be hoping to see more of the AJ people feared in the past, to which he replied: “But I feel like I never got that respect. Let’s keep it 100, let me be real with you.” When asked whether he thought people used to assume he would always KO his opponents, Joshua answered: “Nah, that’s wrong. When I came into this division, it was whack. I thought, ‘Alright, you know what? I’m gonna come in this game and take on everyone and anyone.’ “It doesn’t matter who, I can only beat what’s in front of me, but I’ve gotta make sure that they’re top. “Maybe it’s because I’m British that none of these lots is respecting my thing. I said, ‘Alright, you know what? I’m gonna bring the heavyweight division to Great Britain, I’ll show people we are solid.’ “Because I think people think we drink tea and eat biscuits and sit with the Queen. “I feel like I’m not getting looked at as someone who is a dominant heavyweight in the division. “This big Anthony Joshua goes and wins, becomes three-time, I’ll dash these belts. Because you’ve gotta learn to respect me as a person. Quote that. “I’m tired, I don’t want to be respected because of the belts I hold. I wanna be respected because of the man you see.”
