KuCoin saw growing demand for its exchange ahead of the recent market dump and that trend will likely continue. The Sandbox is looking to become the ‘Manhattan of the metaverse’ and investors could get in early for the next metaverse pump. A better investment for investors could be in Chronoly.io (CRNO). A decentralized platform that is bringing luxury watch investing to the blockchain. That will appeal to traditional investors, and crypto enthusiasts will see appeal in things like staking and the fact you can trade NFTs that are 100% backed by the physical watch. KuCoin (KCS) Will See a Return to User Uptrend KuCoin saw a strong boost from new users on the exchange in the first quarter of 2022 and then the bear market hit. The project’s CEO Johnny Lyu has said that the bear market is temporary and KuCoin can benefit from a return to growth. KuCoin is about to embark on a buyback of tokens to cut its coin supply by half. That will increase the value of each token and KuCoin is also set to threaten the other platforms with its daily bonus for holders of over 6 KCS tokens. The Sandbox (SAND) Can Benefit from Metaverse Growth The Sandbox (SAND) can benefit from growth in the metaverse, and the project’s CEO has said that he wants the platform to be the ‘Manhattan’ of the metaverse. There will be stiff competition for that title, but the founder also stated that despite seeing many bear trends in crypto, he is focused on building in the metaverse. More building means more potential and a bigger lead in the metaverse virtual space. The first bull run in the Sandbox native token SAND was driven by the Facebook transition to metaverse and will also likely catch the next bullish move. Chronoly.io is Ready to Ride its Own Bull Wave Chronoly.io is a new project set to be launched and it has the opportunity to ride its own bull wave. The project is set to be unique and will operate initially with no competition. A decentralized marketplace for luxury watch investing and authentication will bring a trusted investment to the crypto world with asset-backed NFTs. The luxury pre-owned watch market has gained more than 30% this year as investors chased tangible assets with soaring inflation. Chronoly.io will now bring that to the blockchain and fractional investment will help retail investors to get involved. The watch investment market, like fine art or wine, has usually been reserved for the wealthy due to the high price tags and the need for intermediaries and issues such as delivery and storage to factor in. Chronoly.io will remove those issues with its trading platform and asset-backed NFTs. Pricing will be more transparent and verification will be provided by the blockchain for added security. Chronoly stores the physical version of the watches in a fully-insured depositary and the project has also been audited. All this has made the Chronoly (CRNO) token to rally over 660% in the last couple of weeks. Analysts expect the token to skyrocket once it closes its public presale. Experts are talking of a price target between $0.4 and $0.75.
