A new member of the Pentathlon Federation of Nigeria board, Bartholomew Francis Chima, has challenged corporate bodies to identify with programmes that can fast track sports development in the country. Speaking at the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) secretariat after receiving an award and a certificate of membership from president of the Modern Pentathlon Federation of Nigeria, Dr. Jonathan Nnaji, Chima said, “it is quite an honour to be selected as a board member of this dynamic federation. He promised to contribute his quota in ensuring the young federation “etches its name in global sports,” adding: “I feel excited in that I have always wanted to identify with any sports federation, but the right avenue had not been created. “I equally believe in corporate participation in the development of sports, giving the right attitude and complementing each others ideas and efforts.” He praised MPFN leadership for launching the country into global reckoning within a few years of the federation’s existence when in 2017 it hosted the African Youth Olympics qualifiers and African Senior Championship, where they placed second. He thanked the Federal Government for supporting the body, advising that government should pay more attention to sports, like the modern pentathlon that has the potential of winning more medals for the country.
