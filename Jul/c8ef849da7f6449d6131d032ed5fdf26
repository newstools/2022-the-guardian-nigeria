The Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC) has commenced the training of 600 school sports masters/PE teachers, as a first step in the deployment of the Lagos State School Sports Intervention Programme (LASSIP). Speaking on the commencement of the programme, LSSC chairman, Sola Aiyepeku, said the programme would be deployed as a pilot scheme in partnership with the Lagos State Ministry of Education, as part of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s investments in young Lagosians to provide them with more options and opportunities for the future. The flag-off/opening ceremony of the knowledge-based LASSIP scheme will hold on Friday at the Indoor Sports Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere. ”We conceived LASSIP because of the lacuna in school sports in the state, as we wanted to fully reintegrate sports back into schools. Governor Sanwo-Olu is the biggest supporter of LASSIP. “As you know, he is at the forefront of any platform that develops young Lagosians and he has fully bought into this and has provided all the resources necessary to make this intervention successful,” he said. Speaking on the capacity development programme, Aiyepeku said the statewide training programme is the first of its kind in Nigeria and is fundamental to achieving the full potential of LASSIP. “We have designed a training module, which will be field and classroom-based and games masters are the resources we need to deploy these training in schools.” “Because the modules are based on the latest advances in school sports, it is imperative that we train game masters so that they can effectively deploy this training to students in schools. “This is why our partnership with the Ministry of Education is very important. Our Directorate of School sports will work directly with the ministry and so far, we are extremely excited to have the ministry on board as partners. The ministry completely understands the potential impact of this programme and is doing all it can as a valuable partner,” he said.
