• OPS says production costs up by almost 100%
• Manufacturers cite dwindling capacity utilisation, inventory and profitability
• Telcos, Towercos groan as diesel costs gulp N141.5b in five months
• MNOs already spent six times what was expended on diesel in 2021
• Diesel hike forces companies to review workforce, says food union 
• Lingering fuel shortage undermining listed firms’ growth, will impact half-year financials For consumers optimistic of lower diesel prices or drop in inflation rate anytime soon, they may be disappointed, as oil price outlook remains volatile, alongside challenges of inflation, hiked interest rates, supply constraints and expected cold winter.  MEANWHILE, the NCC has called on mobile network operators (MNOs), Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Towercos, among others to switch to alternative power supply in the meantime.
   
The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, said renewable energy, including solar have been recommended to MNOs, ISPs, among others, to deploy pending when diesel cost comes down.
   
“They need to come up with new business cases. You cannot rely on the same business case and expect a different result. We need to be innovative, collaborative, engage each other and find how we can solve the challenges before us so that the growth of the sector is not stalled. I am for alternative energy supply so that we can ensure that the sector remains vibrant and continues to provide services for Nigerians at affordable cost,” he said.
   
Similarly, the Food, Beverage and Tobacco Senior Staff Association (FOBTOB) said costly diesel is forcing most companies in the sector to review their workforce strength.
 
The union’s National President, Jimoh Oyibo, told The Guardian that due to the increased energy cost, most member companies are struggling to survive. According to him, not all are able to power their plants for the full day.
 
“As some will run theirs for some time and stop and by the time you are not running your plant optimally, the tendency is either you are heading to a closure or it also will amount that you cannot meet with your overhead. Ultimately, you have to review your workforce. That is the challenge the industry is facing,” he said.  IN a related development, Head of Equity Trading, Planet Capital, Paul Uzum, said the impact of fuel crises on stock brokering firms and quoted companies are quite tremendous as many stockbroking firms now conduct part of their businesses remotely while some open their offices three days a week. Uzum underscored the need for government to fully deregulate the downstream sector and let Nigerians get used to paying the fair price for fuel. He said: “For listed firms, we will see the impact by next week when the half year financials are published. However, it is natural that it will have tremendous impact on many firms. “Consumer goods firms reaction would naturally be to increase sales price, which is manifest in the rising inflation levels. But many service firms, especially banks, will struggle with it. Oil and gas firms would benefit significantly from the rising energy cost.” President of Ibadan zone of Shareholders Association, Eric Akinduro, said fuel crisis has impacted negatively the operations of listed companies and dampened their stock prices on the exchange. He argued that one of the major reasons most listed firms turned moribund in the past was due to high cost of production, occasioned by high cost of diesel and fuel, stating that this has continued to deter investment growth and profitability.
