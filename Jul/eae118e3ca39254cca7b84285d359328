Often times one of the signs start off with a lump, however, not all lumps are indicative of breast cancer. The discovery of a significant finding in the human body can be quite startling and unnerving.
This is especially so as quite often, we are quick to equate a lone symptom with a disorder; without proper consultation, investigations and diagnosis. Factors such as fear, anxiety, uncertainty, past traumatic experiences of ours and others, can be contributory to this type of behaviour. The discovery of a lump in a male or female breast should be a matter of concern and not of worry, as the latter makes us anticipate problems and results in a loss of control. If you are ever in doubt of a symptom that you have, please ensure you see a doctor to prevent and manage resultant emotional and physical complications. Remember there is no health without mental health. Slide to view the gallery below:
