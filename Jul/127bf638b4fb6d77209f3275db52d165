Members of the Odinma Nsukka have applauded Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State for the giant development strides of his administration in the state in spite of the harsh economic realities in the country and the state’s lean resources. The group, comprising notable sons and daughters of Nsukka zone, said they are pleased with the peaceful atmosphere in the state entrenched by Ugwuanyi, as well as his infrastructural development in the rural areas of the state. Speaking when Odinma Nsukka paid a thank-you visit to the governor at the Government House, Enugu, the Chairman of the group, Chief Vita Abba, expressed gratitude to the governor for the establishment and licensing of the State University of Medical and Applied Sciences (SUMAS), Igbo-Eno, Enugu, by the National Universities Commission (NUC). Abba, who commended the governor for “the remarkable feat,” said: “We were, indeed, looking forward to the Enugu State University of Technology (ESUT) medical campus, but you were thinking bigger for Ndi-Nsukka.” It was just like the Federal Polytechnic, Ohodo, that came as a surprise to all of us. Our gratitude knows no bound.” The group applauded Ugwuanyi for his commitment towards the provision of “top-notch infrastructure to the people of the state and, indeed, Enugu North Senatorial District.”
