•Broadband penetration hits 44.3% as teledensity climbs to 108% For the first half of the year, telecommunications operators added 8.9 million subscribers to the country’s network. Apparently, the 8.9 million subscribers consisted of new users and those, whose telephone lines were barred in April, who has been unbarred. The new figure was arrived at from the latest subscription figure, the June edition, which was released by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), yesterday. Recall that in April, the Federal Government ordered telecom operators to bar outgoing calls on all unlinked Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) cards in the country. The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isah Pantami gave the directive, following the deadline handed Nigerians to link their National Identification Number (NIN) to their SIMs, which ended on March 31, after about eight times of postponing it. The directive of the FG led to the barring of about 75 million telephone lines. However, recognising the fact that every single line blocked would amount to revenue loss, the telcos deviced means targeted at wooing back the affected subscribers. Airtel, Globacom and MTN wooed affected subscribers by offering them a free N20, 000 airtime bonus if they linked their SIMs to the NIN database. “Once subscribers link their NIN to their SIMS, they will get an N20,000 bonus, which can be used to call, browse and text on the network,” one of the operators stated. In the latest statistics, teledensity moved from 103.4 per cent in January to 108.15 per cent as of June end. Telephone density or teledensity is the number of telephone connections for every hundred individuals living within an area. It varies widely across the nations and also between urban and rural areas within a country. Telephone density has a significant correlation with the per capita GDP of the area. In January, the country had 197.5 million subscribers; 198.1 million in February; 199.6 million in March; 201.7 million in April; 2014.6 million in May and 206.4 million in June.
