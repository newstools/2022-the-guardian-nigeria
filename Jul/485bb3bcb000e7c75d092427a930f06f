Lagos Area Manager, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA),  Sarat Braimoh, yesterday, said investigations on the recent boat mishap that claimed the lives of 17 people, revealed that the boat loaded at containerised jetty that was shut down last year June.  MEANWHILE, the  Ovori of Ibeshe, Oba Alani Gausu, has identified human errors and negligence to regulations as causes of boat accidents on Lagos waters.
  
According to him, most boat operators on Lagos waterways do not have formal training and orientation in handling boats; neither are there rules on standards for boat operations.
   
The traditional ruler noted that the operators do not have knowledge of operating boats, adding that some of them are underage and are addicted to drugs as well as use inferior boats with big engines, thereby leading to accidents on the waterways.  “The boat captain did not check the level of fuel and oil in the boat engine. It was after pushing the boat to the water that he realised he needed to mix the oil and fuel in the engine of the boat,” he narrated.
  
The traditional ruler narrated that a situation where a boat ferried 10 passengers along with several gallons of petroleum products from the Ijegun area to Ibeshe, was a recipe for disaster.
  
He said there is a need for NIWA, LASWA, LAGFERRY, Boat operators association, Lagos State government and other stakeholders to come together and address the issue of boat accidents in riverine areas since human lives are involved.
