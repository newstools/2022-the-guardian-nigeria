The Managing Director of BSTAN homes and property, a real estate company, Becky Olubukola, has expressed concern over the lack of affordable housing in Lagos state, adding that the situation needs to be arrested with immediate effect. Olubukola, who stated this during the opening of their company in the state, said that to resolve this situation, her company would be holding a National House Fair in Lagos, which intends to make 10 families land owners. According to her, “This is the first edition of the National Housing Fair holding in Lagos and it is going to be held on December 1, 2022 at Oriental hotel.” She, however, urged intending participants to log on to their website www.nationalhousefair.com to get a raffle ticket, adding that the ticket can also be used to win other prizes. She said that her company’s intervention in ensuring housing availability and affordability was due to the pathetic situation many Lagosians, who live in the slum, pass through. “We can’t overemphasis the need for housing in Lagos. There are several people who live in the slum and many people who can’t afford to pay for rent and they are everywhere. One of the things BSTAN homes intends to achieve is to make homes affordable for everyone,” she said. Speaking earlier, the MD Kinetic Hospital, Abuja, Adewunmi Ayodele, also added that the upcoming house fair will be bringing a lot of opportunities to the youths, saying, “It specifically targeted youths to own property and become investors in real estate. Apart from investing in real estate, they would have that opportunity to learn other things like soft skills and how to run a business. During that fair, people who have business ideas will be allowed to present it in order to get sponsors for their ideas if they eventually won,” he stressed.
