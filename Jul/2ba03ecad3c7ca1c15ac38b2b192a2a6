Speaking at a forum themed ‘Insurance in Nigeria: The Next Frontier’, Ashade, said, “To achieve our collective goal of economic growth and development in Nigeria, there is an evident need for inter-sectoral collaboration across the private and public financial service sectors. We, at United Capital Plc, look forward to further constructive and productive dialogues across industries in the near future.” On his part, the MD/CEO, United Capital Securities, Bawo Oritsejafor, said “Our goal was for this forum to serve as a catalyst for an organic discourse on how to increase insurance penetration and adoption in Nigeria as well as prospects for collaboration outside the realm of the financial services sector. We are enthusiastic about the future of the insurance sector, thanks to the useful insights provided by our speakers and panelists.” Indeed, the forum was headlined by Sunday Olorundare Thomas, Commissioner for Insurance and CEO of the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), who gave the keynote address and thereafter participated in a fireside chat with Peter Ashade, Group CEO, United Capital Plc to discuss strategic measures adopted by the insurance commission to aid regulatory capacity building.
