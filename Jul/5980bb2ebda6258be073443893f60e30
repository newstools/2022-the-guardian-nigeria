For example, advertising a skincare product on a food influencer page is inadvisable. Be clear with what you want: Most influencers are good at quick patronage, while some are just for visibility. This is where research comes in. Carefully map out the goal of your promotion and relay it to the selected influencer, ensuring to inform him/her what you would require. You could dictate the type of content you want, how long it should be and the amount of creativity used in its execution. Influencer.

If you notice an influencer doesn’t have enough engagements on his/her posts, chances are your product won’t receive the level of awareness you hoped for. Be professional: Never underestimate the power of a legal contract. Ensure to always get your selected influencer to sign a contract, stating the necessary requirements and what would happen if he fails to meet these terms and conditions. Don’t rely on familiarity or word of mouth to get the job done. Make sure your business is registered: Doing this makes you have the legal backing of the federation should the influencer fail the terms and conditions.
