MTN Foundation Executive Secretary, Odunayo Sanya, has said that the foundation is committed to solving problems and creating sustainable value in communities where MTN operates.  He said, “Year on year since 2020, we have had to increase our budgetary allocation for health and education, and it is deliberate. On education, we realise that we need to have a government that ensures that access to quality education is available to all. On health, we have not only increased the number of staff and have recruited over 3000 new health practitioners and increased our infrastructure. We are renovating 15 General hospitals and building capacity in all our facilities.”
