With international tourism continuing to rise, and more options than ever to book high-performing cars quickly, revenue for the car rental market is set to increase by 7.2% over the next 9 years. From Airbnb-style instant rental companies offering instant access to more vehicles than ever before, it’s no surprise more of us than ever are choosing to rent luxury cars instead of purchasing them. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1803091 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-1704x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1704" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-1704x1152.jpg 1704w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-885x598.jpg 885w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-1536x1038.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-2048x1384.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-320x216.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-640x433.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09696-600x406.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1704px) 100vw, 1704px" /> Why Buy When You Can Rent?

With a focus on providing a shorter-term and more sustainable alternative to buying a polluting supercar, renting out your favorite vehicle not only saves on emissions and helps reduce your carbon footprint but it will save you money too. Many of the key global rental companies recognize the responsibility they have to reduce their carbon footprints which is why many have a wide range of reliable, high-performing electric cars on offer too. Rent an electric car for your next road trip and enjoy a guilt-free adventure. And with more technology for electric cars than ever before, going green doesn’t mean missing out. There are now plenty of options available in the supercar market including high-performing models such as Tesla, Mercedes, and Jaguar e-type to name a few. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1803092 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-1858x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1858" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-1858x1152.jpg 1858w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-964x598.jpg 964w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-1536x952.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-2048x1270.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-320x198.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-640x397.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DSC09837-1-600x372.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1858px) 100vw, 1858px" /> Get Into Gear This Summer With Rental Luxury Cars Just like splurging on a luxury holiday, more people are now choosing to spend their money guilt-free on renting supercars, traveling in style to work, weddings, or the office without the longer-term financial commitment that comes with owning one.
