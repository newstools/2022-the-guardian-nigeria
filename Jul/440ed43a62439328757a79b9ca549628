A non-governmental organisation (NGO) has distributed drugs and other medical items to over 11 health facilities in Adamawa State. The programme manager of the NGO, Grassroots Life-Saving Outreach (ESGO), Mr. James Siggi, during the flag-off of the second phase in Yola, yesterday, said the scheme was to ensure that vulnerable people are not excluded from health services. According to him, the health facilities in Madagali and Michika local councils are selected to benefit from the free drugs and other medical items for free administration on select groups in the areas. He disclosed that United Nations (UN), through Nigeria Humanitarian Fund (NHF), funds the programme.
