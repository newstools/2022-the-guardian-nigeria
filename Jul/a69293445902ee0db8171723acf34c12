President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday sympathised with former PDP National Chairman, Alhaji Adamu Muazu, over the killing of his brother and abduction of his sister by bandits. In a statement by his media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, on Sunday in Abuja, Buhari said: “I am shocked and outraged by the story of the killing of your brother and the abduction of your sister by bandits. ”This double tragedy is particularly moving. I know it’s hard to cope with the weight of this tragedy in your family. I feel your pain. “Let me use this opportunity to reassure you and other Nigerians currently facing threats from the atrocities of the bandits that I will leave no stone unturned to ensure these enemies of humanity are finally crushed and decisively defeated. ”Security is my constant concern and I have kept the service chiefs on their toes to ensure that they come up with a decisive solution to end this menace.” He prayed to God to forgive the soul of the deceased and grant the family fortitude to overcome the double tragedy.
