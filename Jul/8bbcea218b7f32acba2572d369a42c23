Ike made these comments in reaction to an interview by Mercy Eke on the “Frankly Speaking” podcast where she revealed that she once dated someone she was taking care of. Mercy also denied dating Ike after one of the podcast’s hosts Nedu assumed she was referring to their relationship.   A post shared by Iké  (@iam_ikeonyema) Taking to Instagram, Ike wrote “I am responding to this, because it’s obvious that the producers of this podcast can’t pay for ads to promote the dead podcast, so as usual, they look for who to attack to indirectly promote their dead podcast, well congratulations you have Triggered perfectly, for over two years my image and reputation have constantly been dragged to the mud.” “So it’s time to swim with pigs, I am making a bold statement that no lady whosoever has taken care of me. If anyone claims otherwise they should bring out receipts of one thing they have done, I have been quiet because I don’t also want to expose so many people including the show.” “So I intentionally allowed myself to be ridiculed, but that era is over, people that can’t take care of their family coming out to chat shit about me, @nedu_wazobiafm and @prettymikeoflagos please be careful how involve yourself in things you have no idea of the background story.” “I respect both of you but I would not hesitate to call you guys out if I’m being disrespected to please your principals and the bosses that hired you. This should be the last time anyone would use me to count cheap scores.” “I would start dropping receipts and exposing everyone if this continues, I have enough receipts to go around and everybody go collect, enough is enough!!!!! A word is enough for the wise!!!!!” Ike and Mercy met during the fourth season of Big Brother Naija and continued their relationship outside the house. However by the end of 2020, the couple announced their split.
