Between July 6 and 8, a total of 18 persons lost their lives in two boat mishaps in Ikorodu and Mile 2 areas of Lagos State.  Also, unapproved sites/jetties are also springing up along the inland waterways without due approval, or are not being built to standard.”
    
While stressing that unapproved landing sites/ jetties without necessary permit or documentation would be shut down, he explained that “the list of approved jetties with LASWA oversight would soon be published, while we continue to promote the use of life jackets and sensitise waterways stakeholders on its use on the inland waterways.”
  
For the state Commissioner for Information, Gbenga Omotoso, safety on waterways was more than wearing a lifejacket, even though every passenger is mandated to wear a lifejacket before boarding any boat.
  
Omotoso, who recalled that the state government recently distributed lifejackets at Ibese jetty for the safety of Lagosians, added that government will continue to sensitise private boat operators on the need for them to obey, and follow all safety rules and regulations.
