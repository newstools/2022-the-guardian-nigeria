Department of State Services (DSS) has denied reports that one of its personnel escaped from Kuje prison during an attack on the facility on Tuesday night. The report had alleged that one of the escaping inmates who claimed to be a DSS personnel was apprehended by NCS operatives near Kwali after a chase It further stated that the DSS operative also claimed to be “carrying out a special mission in the forest”. But spokesperson of the secret police, Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Thursday maintained that none of its personnel was involved in the escape episode. “In fact, at the point of the attack on the prison, no DSS personnel was an inmate at the holding facility just as the claim of carrying out a special assignment was non-existent. The report is not factual and therefore misleading. The public is advised to disregard it,” he added.
