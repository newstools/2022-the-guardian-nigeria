 Nicki Minaj . PHOTO: USAToday Nicki Minaj has teased a six-part documentary series about her life and come-up in the rap game. The “Moment For Life” rapper shared a trailer on her social media accounts on Thursday (July 28). It shows her as a young, unproven rapper hustling for recognition as the only female MC in the mainstream, using self-medication to get through difficult times, and eventually maturing and loving herself. In the trailer, she said, “I never wanted to be mainstream.” Her 2018 single “Chun-Li” played in the background as she continued “, Mainstream came to me.” Her top 20 Billboard Hot 100 single from 2011 with Drake, “Moment 4 Life,” serves as the music for the trailer’s concluding moments as she waves to her audience on stage while they sing along to every word of the song. In the post’s caption, she wrote, “I took some time to perfect this very intimate, delicate, electrifying, inspiring body of work.” Coming SOON!!!! The #NickiDocumentary you didn’t know you needed. Love you so much. 🫶 pic.twitter.com/KbOY5fPU0s — Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) July 28, 2022 “Coming out SOONER THAN YOU THINK.” “As I decide on a home for this project, I can’t help but reflect on what I’m including in this doc,” she added. “Some things are so personal, it’s scary. It’s like NOTHING you’ve seen before & I need it to be handled with care. Love you so much. Thank you for the continued support.” On Twitter, she captioned the trailer, “Coming SOON!!!! The #NickiDocumentary you didn’t know you needed. Love you so much.”
