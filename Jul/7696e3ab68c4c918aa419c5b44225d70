Reacting to market performance last week, analysts at Codros Capital said: “In the interim, we believe the full swing of the H1 ’22 earnings season will dictate market sentiments and possibly drive positive performance as investors hunt for bargains in fundamentally sound stocks with a consistent history of interim dividend payments. “Notwithstanding, we envisage intense selling pressures on stocks of companies that grossly underperform in H1, 22. Overall, we reiterate the need: for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” For analysts, Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage firm  “Market sentiment has been bearish all through the week, following Tuesday’s MPR hike with four consecutive negative closes. “While this may bring about attractive entry points in some counters, we are likely to see tepid trading sessions next week as investors continue to trade cautiously. ” However, better than expected Q2 results next week may give the market the necessary positive boost.” Also, a total of 79,914 units of bonds valued at N83 million were traded last week in 31 deals compared to 747,022 units valued at N775 million transacted in 23 deals last week.
