Centre for Law and Business (CLB) in collaboration with Barbri Global, the world’s premier legal education body, has pledged to help lawyers and the legal profession in the West African region gain international qualifications, to be called to Bar in New York and California and become solicitors in the UK.  That, he said, would allow them to obtain cross or multiple professional qualifications.
   
Oyewumi added that cross or multiple professional qualifications place such lawyers on the global professional stage, affording them advantages of international opportunities and serving the needs of international clients, multinationals, multilateral organisations and more.  Meanwhile, in a webinar organised by CLB with the theme: “The International Lawyer: Cross professional qualifications masterclass,” a director, International Partnership at Barbri Global, Chris Jorgenson, while giving a breakdown of Barbri pedigree, noted that it has more than 55 years expertise that focuses on tech-driven preparation for lawyers with a global mindset and more than 38,000 students yearly, who they prepare for U.S. and England & Wales legal qualification assessment. He also noted that 1,500 foreign lawyers yearly seek dual qualifications with Barbri global and they have about 1.5 million alumni, who are lawyers, judges and law students.  “There is a six-month programme, which allows students to study 20 to 30 hours per week and a 10-month programme for 10 to 15 hours per week,” she explained.
