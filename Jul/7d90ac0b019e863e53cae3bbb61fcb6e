A healthcare firm, Lifepro Medicare, has partnered with a non-profit organisation, 100K Club, to screen 200 men for prostate cancer free of charge in Lagos.
 
The firm noted that the ailment was one of the leading killer diseases among men, as current research shows that about 15 of the gender die daily from sickness, making it the deadliest in the most populous black nation. 
 
Head of Operations at Lifepro Medicare, Dr. Okonkwor Oyor, said many Nigerian men had never been screened, noting that though the ailment is more successful when detected early, most men present their cases late, hence the partnership to screen over 100 men pro-bono.  “It is our belief that with this effort to sensitise and educate men about the dangers of late detection, we are able to save lives of thousands of men across the country,” he said.
 
He stated that the health facility “is open to relevant partnerships to further deepen effort towards a healthier nation.”
   
One of the beneficiaries, Kehinde Saliu, said: “I am excited to have finally checked my prostate. I have always wanted to check it before now, but I was discouraged by the price. So, when I heard about the free screening, I registered and showed up. Many thanks to Lifepro Medicare and 100K Club for making this happen.”
