The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday arraigned suspended accountant general of the federation Ahmed Idris in court. EFCC arrived at a federal capital territory (FCT) high court with Ahmed Idris months after his suspension over an N80 billion fraud. Others to be arraigned with Idris include Godfrey Olusegun Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman, and a firm — Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange Limited listed in the charge. The EFCC said Idris and his co-defendants are indicted on a 14-count charge of stealing and criminal breach of trust to the tune of N109.5 billion. Idris was arrested in May after he failed to respond to invitations by the commission to answer questions over the allegation of N80 billion fraud. Nigeria’s finance, budget and national planning minister, Zainab Ahmed thereafter suspended Idris indefinitely without pay.
