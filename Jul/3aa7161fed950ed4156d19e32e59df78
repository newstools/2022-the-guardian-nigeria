Arguing before the presiding judge, Simeone Akpa Amobeda, yesterday, through his counsel, Pius Damba Pius, Nyameh informed the court that he was ready with his witnesses to prove his case. Lawyer to the defendants, Musa Tende, however, informed the Court that they have a preliminary objection, which was a practice direction made on June 28, 2022, that Pius D.
