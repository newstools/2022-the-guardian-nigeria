Manufacturer of heavy-duty equipment, Caterpillar, has urged operators in the oil and gas sector to explore opportunities in gas power technologies. The firm, which reaffirmed its dedication to assisting Nigerian companies with cost-saving solutions, operational optimisation and data-driven power systems, revealed to the operators the enormous potential and how they can explore and take advantage of it. The solutions were presented at a two-day seminar organised for senior executives from the Nigerian oil and gas industry. General Manager, Parts of Mantrac Nigeria Limited (MNL), Mohamed Abdelsalam, said the purpose of the seminar was to re-affirm the company’s commitment on gas power solutions, showcase its electric power solutions and educate participants how to choose engines and manage them more effectively. The business gathering, which was also hosted by Caterpillar’s sole distributor in Nigeria, Mantrac Nigeria Limited, presented a variety of new items and technologies. Specifically, the firm stated that it had 95 per cent of the products readily available in Nigeria.    Mantrac, earlier in 2007, invested in a state-of-the-art complete knock-down (CKD) factory in Nigeria, enabling its capacity to meet local demands. Divided into various segments, Caterpillar and Mantrac representatives explained how the operators could change to and benefit from gas technologies. They also took the audience through insightful discussions on the operations of the latest technologies and how the products could be supported long after purchase. During the seminar, it was also disclosed that Mantrac was recently awarded gold certification for oil and gas service by Caterpillar. The award was an acknowledgment that is reserved for dealers who have stood out for achieving the highest levels in terms of quality and control over processes.
