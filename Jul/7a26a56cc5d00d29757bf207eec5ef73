South West zone representative at the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF), Mrs. Onwuegbu Bose Ngozi, has attested to the rich golf tradition of Ibadan Golf Club (IGC), describing its golf course and the welfare package as topnotch. Onwuegbu, who was in Ibadan at the recently held Captain’s inaugural tournament to perform her oversight function as NGF’s South/West zonal representative, said she came to support the club and the event.
“I’m very satisfied with all I have seen here because IGC is a friendly golf club… if you come here once, you will always want to come back again. They’re friendly, they’re nice people with a fantastic golf course that you will want to play and play again,” said Onwuegbu. The Lady Captain of Dolphin Golf Club, who also emerged runner-up best net in the guest ladies category at the tournament with scores of 106 gross over 78net, promised to do her best in ensuring and encouraging more ladies’ participation in golf at the South/West zone. “I have been doing my best to create more awareness for the game among ladies since coming into office as a zonal representative on the NGF board and I will not rest on my oars until my set out goals are achieved,” the widely travelled golfer said. She described golf as a great game where she derived much joy and gladness socializing with the elite; people of good culture and intellectuals, and playing walking around the big golf course, burning the calories are enough for her wellness.
