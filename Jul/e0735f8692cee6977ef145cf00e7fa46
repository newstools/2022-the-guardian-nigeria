Adelabu’s name missing The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has published the particulars of candidates for the 2023 governorship and state House of Assembly elections in Oyo State. A statement signed by INEC’s Administrative Secretary, Biodun Onikate-Amosu, stated that the newly-published list was in line with both the commission’s scheduled timetable for the 2023 general elections and the Electoral Act 2022, as amended. Onikate-Amosu appealed to the public to scrutinise the particulars of the candidates as published, adding that they could also seek judicial remedy for any noticed or observed violation of the statutes as provided for in Section 29 of the Electoral Act 2022. The list of the governorship candidates as published included Governor Seyi Makinde, who is running for second term in office on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP); Folarin Teslim of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Popoola Joshua of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Ajekigbe Olaniyi of Action Alliance (AA), Agbomeji Olamide of Young Progressive Party (YPP) and Agboyega Raymond of National Rescue Movement (NRM). Others were Ajadi Ganiyu of the Democratic Congress (DC), Sadiq Adigun of the Labour Party (LP), Okunade Adeyemi of Boot Party (BP), Okedara Mojeed of African Action Congress (AAC), Yakubu Adekunle of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Adeniran Oluwaseye of Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Adeshina Excel of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Yusuf Adebola of Action Democratic Party (ADP), Yinusa Ayandoye of Action Peoples Party (APP). MEANWHILE, the name of former Deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and candidate of APC for the 2019 gubernatorial election, Adebayo Adelabu, who recently defected to Accord Party (AP) was conspicuously missing on the list. Adelabu had decamped with his followers to AP when he lost the governorship ticket of APC to Folarin. Efforts to reach him on phone yesterday failed as his line didn’t go through.
