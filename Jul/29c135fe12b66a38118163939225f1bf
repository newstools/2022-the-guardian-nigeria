Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has warned Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, not to sign peace pact with terrorists attacking the state. The Lalong government had reportedly initiated a peace pact, recently, between the Irigwe and Fulani ethnic groups in Bassa Local Council of Plateau, as part of efforts to end ethno-religious crises and killing in the area. HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, stated, yesterday, that the government should, instead, arrest and prosecute marauders who are killing and maiming aboriginal Plateau residents. The rights group added that any local that killed any Fulani, in the name of reprisal, should be similarly arrested and prosecuted in accordance with the law. According to the group, Lalong should not play the role of a certain Santa Claus, who undermines constitutionalism and the fundamentals of law and order. It said a similar move in Kaduna State backfired, as the rampaging terrorists have no respect for agreements and must be crushed by state powers. Onwubiko stated: “Gathering persons, who have lived together as neighbours to sign a peace pact is not the issue here; the problem is that the Plateau government is abdicating her law enforcement authority and duty and has diverted into the arena of political comedy by staging a peace accord, instead of going after Fulani terrorists killing the natives. “Lalong must not be allowed to get away with his plot to grant soft-landing of any kind to mass killers, but must be persuaded and compelled by law to enforce the law and arrest, prosecute and deal with terrorists and killers, irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation, since the law is not a respect of persons. “The comical scenario, where the government is facilitating peace pact with Fulani terrorists, is unconstitutional and illegal. What peace pact is to be made with the aggressor when the aggressor should be punished?”
