Labour Party presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi, yesterday, at Umuahia, the Abia State capital, said there was too much waste in the country and predicted that tyranny would consume the country if the right things were still left undone. He was addressing members of the Mater Dei Catholic Cathedral and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), who welcomed him to Umuahia, as the Special Guest of Honour during the 2022 Alex Otti Foundation Scholarship’s yearly beneficiaries’ award ceremony. Obi said for Nigeria to move forward, it had to shift away from consumption to production and prayed that God would use him to effect the necessary changes in the country. “We cannot continue to suffer when God has endowed the country with all the resources that would prosper us, promising to do the needful to make the positive change impact if elected president,” he said. The Labour Party governorship candidate in the state, Dr Alex Otti, stressed the need to take back Nigeria and Abia State from the hands of those that have mismanaged their resources, citing the high cost of governance as part of the waste. The Umuahia Diocesan Administrator, Bishop Michael Ukpong, prayed to God to complete the emergence of Obi from presidential candidate to the elected president. Speaking through Rev. Father Henry Maduka, he urged people to obtain their PVCs to enable them to cast their votes.    “Nigerians should take time and scrutinise the candidates and their antecedents before deciding who to vote for in the 2023 elections. It is not God that would cast our votes,” he said.
