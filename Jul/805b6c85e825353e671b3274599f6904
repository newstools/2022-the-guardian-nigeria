This is because you have to care for it as you would a baby. Scientifically, a dog’s brain and mental abilities can be compared to a child aged 2 to 2.5 years.
1. Providing a clean environment for your dog to protect it from the elements and hazards, as well as ensuring good hygiene, is basic to a quality life.
2. Always keep fresh water available: Maintaining optimal hydration is important for the health and energy of your dogs.
3. Providing a quality diet: Overweight dogs can adversely have their health affected in several ways. It is advisable to follow the dietary recommendations that the veterinary doctor will make according to the nutritional needs of one’s dog. Such decisions will be based on the size of the dog, the age, level of activity and breed. Also, remember to provide healthy treats rather than table scraps as rewards.
4. Have your dogs examined by the veterinarian regularly. The veterinarian will provide you with information on vaccination schedules, deworming, and eternal parasite control. It is also necessary to keep vaccination records in your home or note down your last treatment.Contact the veterinarian if you believe your dog may be ill, or injured, or if something just does not seem right. Your veterinarian is the expert on keeping your dog healthy.
5. Provide ample opportunities to exercise. Make sure your dog gets the regular exercise needed to enable it to be fit. By being in shape, your dog will be more capable of participating in the activities that it enjoys.
6. Communicate with your dog and develop a relationship. Dogs are social creatures just like humans are. Dogs need to interact with their owners. Quality time will help you get to know your dog and understand its particular needs. Also, enhance your ability to recognise early signs of an illness that could be developing. In addition, time spent on developing a relationship will prevent many undesirable behavioural patterns. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1816551 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-920x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="832" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-920x598.jpg 920w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-1772x1152.jpg 1772w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-1536x998.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-320x208.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-640x416.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920-600x390.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/pet-g540b3244a_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
7. Train your dog to follow simple commands. Puppy and dog training classes can be very helpful. The better your dog is at following basic necessary commands, the greater the chances are that your dog will be safe and live a long life.
8. Practice reproductive control. If you do not intend to create puppies, spaying or neutering is certain and should be done often.
9. Dental care is important. Dogs have teeth too; try brushing their teeth once a day. Alternatively, provide an enzymatic chew to help prevent tartar accumulation, dental disease, and bad breath.
10. Do not overlook grooming and nail trimming. Long-coated dogs are prone to having bugs and ice balls in their hair. Overgrown nails are common in elderly dogs, and this can make it difficult for them to walk. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1816553 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-903x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="847" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-903x598.jpg 903w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-1740x1152.jpg 1740w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-1536x1017.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-320x212.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-640x424.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920-600x397.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/corgi-g5cebb9227_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
11. Give your dog a safe space. Have a temperate area of your home with your dog’s bed or blanket, some toys, and a water bowl where your dog is safe and can easily take naps during the day.
12. Regularly wash your dog’s bedding, soft toys, and blankets. They should be washed weekly to keep them fresh and clean.
13. Fight boredom by adding variety: Break up your dog’s normal routine by adding in walks or outings. Take them on errands with you and switch up their toys to keep them mentally stimulated.
14. Hang out with your dogs while they eat. Dogs are by nature pack animals, and you are their pack. Stay near them when they eat and make this an ongoing communal act.
In conclusion, knowledge is power. Read up and learn as much as possible about your dog’s breed specifically and about raising, training, and living with dogs.
