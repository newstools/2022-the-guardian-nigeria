A security guard simply identified as ‘Mr Sunday’, attached to Titolu Venture filling station in Igoba, Akure North Local Council  of Ondo State was on Monday,  shot dead by unknown gunmen,  who also razed down the station. The station manager, Oluwatobiloba Ajisafe , said he was notified about the fire incident at about 4:00a.m., but couldn’t suspect or link anyone to the heinous act. He said: “At about 4 :00a.m., I was called by one of the residents, and on getting there, I saw the station burning and  called the fire service. They came to extinguish  the fire not knowing the perpetrators had killed our security guard. “While trying to figure out what could have caused the fire, we saw where the guard was tied and killed. We also saw the keg used by the arsonist filled with petrol which part of it must have been used to wet the station before setting it on fire.” Contacted, the  State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mrs. Funmi Odunlami, who confirmed the incident, said investigation was ongoing to unravel the circumstances that led to the incident. She also said the remains of the guard have been deposited in a mortuary.
