Jon Rahm has leapt to the defence of Sergio Garcia over his ongoing battle with the DP World Tour, claiming they have “turned their backs” on his Spanish compatriot over his involvement in LIV Golf, reports nationalclubgolfer.com. Speaking after Garcia revealed plans to quit the DP World Tour because of a ‘lack of love’, Rahm called for reconciliation between his countryman and the organisation where he’s spent over two decades playing in. “Sergio knows very well that he has dedicated his life to the European Tour in his 25 years as a pro,” Rahm told Spanish media. “That they turn their backs on him this way doesn’t seem right to me. It hurts me that he has to make this decision.” Rahm was also clearly frustrated at the possibility of Garcia being excluded from the Ryder Cup should he follow through with his decision to quit the DP World Tour. The duo were a rare shining light in what ended up being a record defeat for Europe last time out, returning three points from three matches at Whistling Straits. “It bothers me even more that he can’t play the Ryder Cup – the event that gives golf the most publicity around the world,” Rahm continued. “Because of this nonsense, there are players like him who can’t play. That already makes me a little angrier. “It is something that creates this sport. It is the reason that my family and I started playing golf and the reason that many in this world play golf. “Because of what is happening, Sergio is not going to play, the best player Europe has ever had. It seems difficult to understand the process. “In the end, he does what is best for him. And if the others do not cooperate, it is what is. I hope they sit down and talk.” Garcia has already resigned his PGA Tour membership after defecting to LIV Golf, meaning putting an end to his DP World Tour will end any hopes of playing in next year’s Ryder Cup. The Spaniard will next tee up in the breakaway series at Bedminster later this month.
