The Nigerian Breweries Plc has advocated the need for the Federal Government to place sorghum as a focus crop under its ‘Anchor Borrower Programme’ given the growing demand and usage by many manufacturing companies in its production processes.  He explained that the company’s local cultivation of sorghum varieties had assisted a great deal in reducing the amount of foreign exchange spent on the importation of sorghum, which has impacted the cost of production for both non-alcoholic and alcoholic products in the last few years.
 
He stated that the success story of the cultivation of sorghum varieties could be attributed to the level of support and collaboration between the research team and the farmers adding that the investment has gone a long way in supporting livelihoods in the entire agricultural value chain.          
   
Essaad further called for government’s support, especially in critical investments in irrigation, infrastructure and institutional reforms.
