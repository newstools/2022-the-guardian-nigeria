Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, yesterday, rewarded each player of Rivers United Football Club with cash prizes and two weeks visit to Madrid, Spain, following their win in the 2021/2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The players, their coach and management have also been conferred with the state’s prestigious ‘Governor Service Award’. A statement by the governor’s media aide, Kelvin Ebiri, said Wike made the promise in a colourful reception held at the Government House, Port Harcourt, yesterday. According to the statement, Wike, who acknowledged the team’s sacrifice, determination and hard work throughout the 2021/2022 league season, rewarded each player with $20,000. “Each of you will go home with $20,000. For me, you deserve to get more than that, if not for the harsh economy. You have done well, and let me tell you, if you qualify in the group stage of this Confederation of African Football (CAF) competition, we will double it for you.” Wike has, meanwhile, directed the Commissioner of Sports, Chris Green, to arrange for a two weeks training session for the Rivers United team in Madrid, Spain. The governor explained that the government and people of Rivers State are delighted that their team won the coveted NPFL trophy. “I am not surprised because I saw your dedication and commitment and I knew that he who works hard, God will always give the support to emerge victorious,” he said. Governor Wike urged the players to strive to be physically and psychologically prepared in order to excel during the CAF competition next season. “You need to be prepared psychologically to face other competitors. We are talking about Africa, not West Africa. So, you have such a huge task. You must be prepared to achieve. So, on our own as government, we must do everything humanly possible to encourage you,” the governor declared.
