Despite players’ protest over match allowances and bonuses allegedly owed by the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Olumo United FC Chairman, Segun Solanke, has charged the Super Falcons to compensate themselves with the bronze medal at the ongoing Women African Cup of Nations in Morocco. The Falcons, who fought bravely in a difficult semifinal game having been reduced to nine players against tournament host, Morocco, are billed to challenge Zambia in the losers’ final tomorrow. Having missed out on the title, Solanke urged the team to put the semifinal loss behind them and focus on making their 11th podium appearance, despite being there nine times as champions and once as third placed finisher. “Even though news making the waves has it that the girls were owed match allowances and bonuses, I’m still proud of them. “They have shown their worth despite playing two-woman down against the hosts, Morocco at the semi final stage. It’s obvious they remain a team to reckon with in African female football. “All we need do is to inspire them to victory come Friday night. I want them to realise that the losers’ final will serve as compensation should they defeat the Copper Queens of Zambia. “Apart from that, I want to believe the tournament will serve as an eye opener to our girls. I am happy they have realised that WAFCON is no longer their birthright like they obviously think. The loss to Morocco and defeat against South Africa in the group opener will surely serve as a wake up call ahead of next edition.”
