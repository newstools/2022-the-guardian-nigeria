Rivers United’s Chijioke Akuneto, has emerged winner of the prestigious Eunisell Boot award for the just concluded 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League season (NPFL). The award, instituted by independent chemical and oil and gas engineering solutions company, Eunisell, seeks to instill greatness in players in the domestic top flight and celebrate their success story. Eunisell placed a premium value of N200,000 for each goal scored by the winner in the season. For his feat, Akuneto will receive the reputable Eunisell Boot replica and N3,800,000 at a date and venue to be announced by the company. According to a statement from the organisers: “Eunisell is passionate about the Nigerian League and believes Nigerian players deserve to be celebrated.” High-flying Akuneto scored 19 goals during the just concluded season to finish ahead of other combatants as the Eunisell Boot award winner. Akuneto scored a brace on match day 37 on the road at Shooting Stars to take his tally to 18 goals and moved ahead of others, then scored his 19th goal on the last day of the season at home against Gombe United, last Sunday. Junior Lokosa won the inaugural edition of the Eunisell Boot in 2018 after scoring 19 goals for Kano Pillars and it has since remained an annual award for the highest goal scorer in the NPFL.
