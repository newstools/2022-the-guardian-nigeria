Residents of Port Harcourt have decried poor standard of meat processing in Rivers State.
 
Most worrisome, according to former press secretary to Rivers State Government, Blessing Wikina, and a renowned veterinary doctor, Prof. Clement Alawa, is the absence of a central abattoir in the state  and lack of veterinary doctors in the service of the State Government.
 
The Guardian learnt that make-shit abattoirs have sprang up in various corners after the State Governor, Nyesom Wike, demolished the  State’s  major abattoir located in Woji axis of Port Harcourt in September last year.  The camel, which was been herded towards the slaughter by  Eze Gbaka Gbaka market, a make-shit abattoir, raised concerns that it may be slaughtered for consumption.
  
“More worrisome is the insufficient number of Vet Doctors in the state, that could examine meat before they are certified for sale and consumption. With the absence of a central abattoir in the Port Harcourt metropolis, many abattoir had sprung up in various locations, without facility for meat examinations, before slaughtering.”
  
He called on the state Ministry of Agriculture to investigate this scenario to avert future occurrence.
