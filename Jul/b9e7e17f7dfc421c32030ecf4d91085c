Ogun State Government has appealed to royal fathers to assist in stemming the tide of cultism and other criminal acts, causing loss of lives, and property and tarnishing the state’s hard-earned image. The Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, made the call at the Third Quarter 2022 Statutory Meeting of the State Council of Obas, held at the Conference Hall, Oba’s Complex, Oke Mosan, Abeokuta.
 
Represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Tokunbo Talabi, the governor said the menace of cultism, which was no longer limited to tertiary institutions, had spread to both secondary and primary schools, as well as among artisans and street boys. He said if the trend was not checked, it would lead to a breakdown of law and order in the state.
 
He revealed that the necessary security apparatus had been sensitised and mobilised to put a check on the security challenge and other acts of criminalities, adding that the royal fathers’ efforts would also go a long way in tackling the menace in the interest of the state.
