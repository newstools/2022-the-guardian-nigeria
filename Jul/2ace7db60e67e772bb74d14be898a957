Says UN’s directive must be implemented The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has said that the call by the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for the unconditional release of its leader, Nnamdi Kanu, is an indictment on governments of Nigeria and Kenya. The UN group had, in its July, 2022 report, asked the Federal Government to release Kanu unconditionally within the next six months, stressing that the way he was arrested, as well as prolonging of his case, indicate that the government had nothing against him. It also asked that Kanu be compensated for the illegal extraordinary rendition.  Reacting to the development in a statement, yesterday, IPOB’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, expressed gratitude for global body’s courage in reaching the decision. The statement said the opinion of the group conforms to tenets of international laws. According to IPOB: “The opinion of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention specifically indicted the Nigerian and Kenyan governments for the kidnap and extraordinary rendition of our leader, Kanu, while directing the government of Nigeria to remedy the situation by releasing him unconditionally and to compensate him for the abuse and persecution he has been and continue to be put through. “Our commendation also goes to our legal advisers and all those who labored and assisted in achieving this landmark victory. It is, indeed, a great milestone for Kanu, the IPOB and Biafrans worldwide. “It is our hope that Nigeria, as a member of UN, would heed and promptly implement the UN directives already transmitted to it. We caution that this is not a Nigerian court decision or order that is often flagrantly disobeyed without consequences.”
