Even before art historians at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London (V&A) announced an exhibition focused on South Korean popular culture last year, the art, pop, and fashion sectors were extremely thrilled. According to a press release from the V&A, “Hallyu! The Korean Wave” (24 September–25 June 2023) is the first exhibition of its type to highlight the vibrant and dynamic popular culture of South Korea. More information about how and why South Korea rapidly transformed from a country wrecked by war in the 1950s leading to a cultural powerhouse by the early 2000s has been provided by the exhibition’s organisers. The most significant aspect of this is that hallyu will serve as a “portal to understand ancient and contemporary Korean culture by integrating historic artefacts alongside popular media and socio-political events.” In 2012, it seemed like everyone was jigging to Gangnam Style; the singer PSY’s pink suit jacket will welcome guests as a remembrance of this all-encompassing (and aggravating) dance hit. The pink guard uniforms and a green tracksuit from the popular Netflix series Squid Game, as well as a recreation of the toilet set from Bong Joon-Oscar-winning Ho’s film Parasite, are among the highlights of the “Setting the Scene” area, which is geared toward K-drama and film. The “Global Groove” section examines the K-Pop band growth on social media and provides crucial ephemera, such as early album covers by significant K-Pop pioneers like Seo Taiji, Boys, and BoA. The group BTS, who are regulars in working with Serpentine Galleries in London, will also take part. Important pieces by artists like Nam June Paik, Ham Kyungah, and Gwon Osang are also incorporated into the display. The Ministry of Culture, Sports, and Tourism of South Korea as well as Netmarble Healer.B, a division of the gaming developer Netmarble, are supporters of the exhibition.
