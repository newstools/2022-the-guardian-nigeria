The Association for Hajj And Umrah Operators of Nigeria (AHUON) has urged the Federal Government to urgently review the 2022 Hajj operations. The National President of the Association, Alhaji Nasidi Sulaiman, made the call during a news conference on Friday in Kano. Suleiman said that no fewer than  700  intending pilgrims who were supposed to travel to the Holy land for the 2022 pilgrimage were stranded in Kano, Abuja, and Lagos. “We appeal to the Federal Government of Nigeria to as a matter of urgency set up a powerful and genuine panel to review this year’s Hajj activity from scratch. “What happened is really pathetic in the history of Hajj Operation in the country, with the aim of restoring sanity into the future operations. “Out of our 55 companies, 2,750 intending pilgrims deposited N1.2 million each to the NAHCON account. “Therefore, we call on NAHCON to immediately start remitting the entire amount which is over N3 billion for onward disbursement to our clients,” he said. Sulaiman also said that the review would restore sanity in future Hajj operations in the country. The association urged the National Assembly to set up a committee to consider amending the NAHCON Act 2006 “so that all stakeholders, especially Tour Operators, will have an important role to play in the system.” “We hereby appeal to intending pilgrims that suffered avoidable stress and trauma due to the situation to accept our deep regrets and apologies.”
