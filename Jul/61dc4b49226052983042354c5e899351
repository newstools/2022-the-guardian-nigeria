Chairman, Nigeria Beach Volleyball Commission, Musa Nimrod, has said the federation is aiming at qualification for Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Speaking at the end of round one of the ongoing National Beach Volleyball Tour in Yola, Adamawa State, Nimrod assured that the beach volleyball tour would ensure Nigerian players are fit for major African championships and international outings. “The Nigeria Beach Volleyball Commission decided to commence the National Beach Volleyball tour this year because the aim is for Nigeria to qualify for the Paris 2024 Olympics. We narrowly missed participating in the Olympics twice; Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020. “Nigeria placed second in 2016 behind Egypt and second in 2020 behind Kenya. “We are trying to give new players opportunity to make the country proud and coming to Yola for round one of the National Beach Volleyball Tour is not a mistake, it is by divine intervention.” He told Nigerians to expect more explosive performances in the second and third rounds later this year. “I’m assuring Nigerians that the second and third rounds of this beach volleyball tour will be more exciting and tougher. The second round will be held in the South South, while the third round will hold in the South West. The tour has given opportunity to young players to showcase their talents and that is the pride of the Federation. “I am assuring Nigerians that with what I am seeing now, we are going back to our rightful top position in Africa. Our current rankings might not be encouraging, but I believe that we will return to the summit, particularly, our male team. “Nigeria will attend the African Senior Beach Nations Cup in Morocco by the end of this month and I am assuring you that the boys will give their best; we must expose our players,” he said.
