Speaking earlier on behalf of the Ojude-oba Festival Organising Committee, the Coordinator, Dr Fassy Yusuf, disclosed that this year’s festival, tagged, ‘The Return of the Ojude Oba’ was borne out of the inability of the festival to hold for two consecutive years due to the prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is the special guest honour. Relatedly, Globacom Regional Manager, Ogun State, Mr Ikenna Aguwuom, stated that his company’s participation in the Ojude-Oba festival was borne out of its commitment to identify with the culture and tradition of Ijebuland.
