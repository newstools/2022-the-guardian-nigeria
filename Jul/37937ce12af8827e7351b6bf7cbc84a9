The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Delta Command, has urged motorists to drive with utmost caution and care to avoid road traffic crashes, especially in the rainy season. The Sector Commander, Udeme Eshiet, said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Asaba. According to him, drivers should apply common sense while driving so that when they encounter challenges such as brake failure, they will be able to manoeuvre through. “During this season, every motorist should ensure their wipers, lightening systems, their defrosters or air conditioners are working properly so they can be able to see or be seen while driving. “Motorists should make sure that their vehicle tyres are of good quality because when the rain is heavy, the roads are very slippery and visibility is dull. “Motorists need to drive between 20 kilometres to 30 kilometres on the highway while 10 kilometres to 20 kilometres in built-up areas so as to avoid road traffic crash,” he said. Eshiet, who admonished motorists to shun overloading, speeding and the use of mobile phones while driving, urged them to install speed limit devices in their vehicles especially commercial vehicles, to curtail speeding. “I believe that if all commercial vehicles have the speed limit devices installed in their vehicles, it will have a drastic effect on the number of fatalities on our highways. “We need to have a change of mind, and a change of attitude on speeding, overloading and the use of mobile phones while driving; we need to change our attitudes to road safety cautions, “he added. He said that FRSC would continue to go to motor parks to sensitise commercial vehicle drivers on the dangers of excessive speeding and dangerous driving on highways to avert road traffic crashes.
