 Kevin Spacey Kevin Spacey, an Oscar-winning actor, entered a not guilty plea and was informed that he would go on trial next year. The actor is accused of sexually assaulting three men over a decade ago. At a session at London’s Central Criminal Court, also known as the Old Bailey, Spacey, 62, answered “not guilty” to each of the five accusations while standing in the dock and speaking clearly. The judge Mark Wall presiding on the case scheduled the trial to begin on June 6, 2023, and predicted that it would last three to four weeks. The criminal trials are expected to take place at the Old Bailey, which is the site of Britain’s most illustrious criminal trials. The former “House of Cards” star, who was in charge of London’s Old Vic theatre from 2004 to 2015, denied four counts of sexual assault and one count of inciting another person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The incidents allegedly occurred around March 2005 and August 2008 in London, with one apparently occurring in western England in April 2013. Right present, the victims are in their 30s and 40s. The actors lawyers had initially stated that Spacey, “strenuously denies” the allegations against him. Spacey, is known to have homes in London and the U.S., was granted bail and permitted to return to the United States after a preliminary hearing last month. However, the actor’s unconditional bail was continued by the Judge who said another pretrial hearing would be held early in 2023. The actor thanked the judge after the 15-minute hearing ended. He silently left the court and was ushered through a crowd of paparazzi into a chauffeur-driven car.
