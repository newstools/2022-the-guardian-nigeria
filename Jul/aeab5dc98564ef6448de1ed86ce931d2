Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola was sadly confirming what Nigerians always knew when he expressed regret last week that there was a lack of will by government to act on intelligence reports gathered prior to the attack on Kuje Correctional Centre. Terrorists’ invasion of Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre on the day bandits waylaid the advance-party of President Muhammadu Buhari is confounding and highly lamentable. The twin events, perhaps not unconnected, are like chicken coming home to roost. Yet, most unforgivable has been Mr. President’s dismissive reaction to the glaring beach of national security. Toeing the usual cavalier path in the face of existential peril is unbefitting of remarkable leadership and a reason all Nigerians should be worried.
