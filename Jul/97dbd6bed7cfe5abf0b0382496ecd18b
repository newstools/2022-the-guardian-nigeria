The Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, (NLNG) Limited is working on a plant expansion plan, which will lead to establishment of Train 8, Managing Director of the company, Phillip Mshelbila has said.
   
Mshelbila confirmed that the company has commenced plans to float Train 8, which will be different from the previous ones as the new Train 8 will not only address the issue of increased capacity but will lay emphasis on the reduction of carbon emissions.
   
This is coming as the NLNG advanced on the construction of Train 7 project, projected for completion in four years.  These efforts, he said, are to reduce deforestation, reduce emissions by providing cleaner fuel as well as save lives.
   
Manager, Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, NLNG, Mrs. Sophia Horsfall, said the supply of 100 percent of its Liquefied Petroleum Gas production (Propane and Butane) to the Nigerian market had made a positive impact.
 
She said the move, which was approved by the company’s Board of Directors, had led to the reduction in the prices of LPG, also known as cooking gas, across the country.
 
Horsfall said prioritising the domestic market would help to deepen gas utilization in Nigeria in line with the Federal Government’s declaration of years 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Gas.
