Former Lagos State Football Association chairman, Waidi Akanni, has described the relegation of MFM from the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) as a bad omen for the state. He said Lagos football lovers will begin to understand what has happened to the state when the 2022/2023 NPFL season begins without a club representing them. Olukoya Boys confirmed their relegation to the Nigerian National League (NNL) when they lost at home to Niger Tornadoes in their Match day 36 game on Sunday. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Akanni said signs that the team would go down became obvious towards the end of last season when the club didn’t improve on its staff, adding that it was obvious that they needed some quality players to beef up the team for the current season. “The recruitment of players for the current season was very faulty. The club also did not get adequate support from their fans.” I think the Lagos FA should have done more for Lagos teams playing in the various leagues,” he said. The former international said the NPFL has been destroyed by petty politics, adding that the MFM’s policy of not bribing anybody to gain advantage in matches also worked against the club. “The club does not align with the kind of politics that goes on in our league. Our league needs revival because what we have here in Lagos now are tons of grassroots football academies. Because of lack of incentives for clubs playing in our domestic leagues, individuals now prefer to run academies where they can raise players and export them. “What the club now need to do is to start rebuilding through a recruiting process done professionally. Teams get relegated, but the ability to come back is key,” he said.
