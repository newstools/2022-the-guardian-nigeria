The wrong shade of foundation, blush, and even concealers could throw your entire makeup look off. Similar to choosing foundation shades, choosing the right concealer for your skin tone requires almost the same effort and knowledge. Finding the best concealer shade that perfectly matches your skin tone can be tricky if we’re being honest. And it is not enough to just choose a shade to match your skin tone; you need one that is best suited for your skin type. So, you’ll need to decide if you need a colour correcting concealer, brightening shade, or one that covers up blemishes better. We rightly understand how much work goes into finding the right concealer for your skin, which is why we have created this self-help guide for choosing concealers. How to choose your concealer shade In the past, the sole rule for choosing concealers was to go a shade lighter. However, today, choosing a concealer shade largely depends on what you’re trying to conceal. A common mistake often made by makeup enthusiasts, particularly beginners, is covering their pimples, dark circles, and other blemishes with the same concealer shade. Instead of covering under-eye bags, find a concealer with a peach undertone for lighter skins and one with an orange undertone for darker skins. These shades allow a more seamless transition into the general shade of your skin. To conceal blemishes, choose a colour-correcting green-based concealer to contract redness. How to apply concealers Each concealer comes with a separate application process: Liquid Concealer These concealers come in a tube; they are a more popular concealer type due to their water-based formula, which makes them lightweight and easy to blend. Liquid concealers come in various finishes, from matte to dewy and even satin, making them suitable for all skin types. They can be applied under the eyes to brighten up the area and cover dark circles; they can also be used to hide blemishes, redness and other skin imperfections. Liquid concealers contain a sheer appearance and can be built up for fuller coverage without cakiness. While they often come with applicators, you can choose to apply your liquid concealer with your fingers or use the applicator it comes with. Blend with a beauty blender or concealer brush. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1800125 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Concealers.-Photo-TrendRadars.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1280" /> Stick concealers These concealers come in the same tube as lipsticks. They are thick, creamy concealers that provide medium coverage for dark circles and are perfect for anyone with normal, dry or sensitive skin. Since they are solid, they go on thick and contain oil, making it easy for users to spread and blend. Stick concealers often come with satin finishes and are full-coverage, which makes them the ideal concealer for anyone with severely dark under-eye circles or discolouration. Stick concealers can be applied straight from the tube onto the face and blended out with the fingers. Cream concealers They come in small compacts or pallettes and have a thick consistency. Cream concealers are typically made with waxes and pigments. Cream concealers can be oil-free, making them a great choice for oily skin; they also offer medium to full coverage, which makes them ideal for covering blemishes and scars. Its thick consistency also ensures that it works well with the foundation to remove discolouration. To properly apply these concealers, apply small amounts to problem areas and build up as necessary. Dab the product with a concealer brush and blend out with a beauty sponge. The right concealer-foundation consistency equals a perfect base for any makeup look. So to create the perfect makeup look, you need the right concealer shade and type matched with the right foundation shade.
