Ever since fashion blogger and wife to Steve Harvey, Majorie Harvey, stepped into the public’s eyes, she has served us with iconic fashion looks that are bound to live rent free in our minds forever. Majorie has shown us throughout the years what it actually means to be an ageless style icon, from reinventing street style to showing us how to rock fur and boots. In celebration of the impact her style has on the world, here are some of our favorite fashion steals: Boot for days One thing you might realize while looking at the hundreds of pictures on Marjorie’s Instagram page is her love for knee-high or thigh-high boots. Styling boots requires a level of expertise, which Majorie is no stranger to as she ensures proper color and silhouette coordination between her outfit and boots. Shorts need to work
Whenever she is at a beach or taking a casual stroll on the streets, Majorie sure has heads turning in her gorgeous shorts paired with either a simple shirt or sheer flowing top. Gowns have never looked so good
Majorie and Gowns are like 5 and 6. From ball gowns to waist hugging gowns, Majorie is an example of how to look when storming the red carpet or attending a formal event. An important feature of these gowns is the way they often show off the legs and body frame. Who said baseball caps are just for jeans?
Breaking traditional fashion rules is something Majorie loves doing, especially when she wears accessories like a baseball cap on gowns. Her baseball caps tend to have a casual look, making her outfit look relaxed yet elegant. Coats for comfort and style
There is a feeling you get seeing Majorie in coats; it almost seems like you should have superpowers and transport yourself to her wardrobe.
