The New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) governorship candidate in Gombe State, Khamisu Mailantarki, has described the death of Haruna Abdullahi, a kingmaker in Gombe Emirate, as a great loss to the traditional institution. Mailantarki, in his condolence message to the family, said the deceased contributed immensely to the peace and harmonious co-existence among Gombe residents. Abdullahi died while battling a protracted ailment last Monday at the age of 94. The governorship hopeful said the late Abdullahi, who was the Ajiyan Gombe and district head of Kwami, was a great traditional icon. He added: “The passing of the traditional leader is a huge loss to Kwami Local Council and the state because he was a revered leader that rendered selfless service to humanity throughout his reign.”
