The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has welcomed progress by states towards a long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of net-zero aviation carbon emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement’s temperature objectives. This is noted in the summary of discussions for the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) High Level Meeting held in preparation for the 41st ICAO Assembly later this year. IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, said the ICAO High Level Meeting’s support of a long term goal for states that is in line with the aviation sector’s net-zero by 2050 commitment is a step in the right direction. “A formal agreement at the 41st ICAO Assembly would underpin a common approach by states to decarbonise aviation. That’s critical for the aviation industry. Knowing that government policies will support the same goal and timeline globally will enable the sector, especially its suppliers, to make the needed investments to decarbonise,” Walsh said. In October 2021, IATA member airlines committed to net zero emissions by 2050. The path to achieve this will involve a combination of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), new propulsion technology, infrastructure and operational efficiencies, and carbon offsets/carbon capture to fill any gaps. “Net zero by 2050 will require a global transition for aviation to new fuels, technologies and operations. The significant investments to get there will need a solid policy foundation aligned with a global way forward. That is why it is so important for states to carry the momentum of the High Level Meeting through to a formal agreement at the 41st ICAO Assembly in a few weeks,” Walsh said.
