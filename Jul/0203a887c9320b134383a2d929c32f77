An analyst at Codros said: “With the moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make re-entry ahead of the H1-22 earnings season. “However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a choppy pattern. Therefore, we advise investors to take positions in only blue chips.” Investdata Consulting Limited said: “We note the flow of funds into the fixed income segment on the rate hike by the CBN, as sector rotation persists and players digest the macro-economic data and Q4 unaudited earnings released so far.” “Also, the market continues to interpret the rising inflation concerning the crude oil price and other factors, amid profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. This will result in market players targeting sound and dividend-paying stocks in the hope of dividend announcements.”
