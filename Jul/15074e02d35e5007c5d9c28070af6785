• Oshoala Dedicates Award To Super Falcons
Africa Footballer of the Year award winner, Senegal’s Sadio Mane, has told his fans not to stop believing in what they can achieve. The Senegalese and Bayern Munich striker made the declaration shortly after he was voted for a second time as king of Africa football. Mane was crowned the Africa Footballer of the Year in Morocco on Thursday night, wining the coveted crown ahead of his compatriot, Edouard Mendy and Egyptian star, Mohammed Salah. Writing on his Facebook page, Mane said: “I am so proud. Let me tell you just one thing; never stop believing in yourself,” He thanked all who made the award possible, especially the Confederation of Africa Football, CAF for the honour. “Thank you everyone for helping to achieve my dream.” Super Falcons striker, Asisat Oshoala, made history as the first woman to scoop the award for the fifth time after emerging the winner at the award ceremony in Rabat, Morocco on Thursday night. She has dedicated her record fifth CAF Women’s Player of the Year award to her Super Falcons teammates. The Barcelona Femeni beat Cameroon’s Ajara Nchout and Grace Chanda of Zambia to the award. The 26-year-old was previously tied on four with compatriot, Perpetual Nkwocha. “I had to fight hard to get to this point. I would like to thank all my teammates and my friends at my club FC Barcelona. Muchas gracias. “I also have to thank my friends in the national team. You are the best teammate in the world. In football, there are many lessons and I would like to send a message ‘we can fall back, but we can get back up,” Oshoala stated. Oshoala was ruled out of the ongoing 2022 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations after sustaining a knee injury in Super Falcons’ opening game against South Africa. The Super Falcons took on the Copper Queens of Zambia in the third place match last night.
