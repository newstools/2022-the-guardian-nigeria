To redefine Nigeria’s medical landscape, Paelon Memorial Hospital (PMH) is hosting a painting session tagged, Healing Through Art, as part of activities to mark its 12th year anniversary.
  
The two-week long event, which commenced yesterday, would terminate on July 15.  During the time, free registrations and consultations and other activities would be carried out in communities that been impactful to the journey.  She said: “Over the last decade, the organisation has been able to set itself apart by delivering world class, patient-centred healthcare. In 2020, PMH was one of the first private hospitals in Nigeria to receive accreditation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In November 2021, it went a step further in the battle against the pandemic in partnership with IHS Nigeria, one of the largest independent owners and developers of shared telecommunications infrastructure in the world, to commission a new cylinder gas plant, an oxygen generating plant that would enable the supply of medical oxygen in Lagos. We have also launched a sister brand -The Santis Medical Concierge – and recently, it inaugurated a virtual community for women tagged, ‘The Village.’
  
“Over the years, we have seen how our little efforts have made changes in the lives of our patients, partners, staff and the public. As we look to the future, I’m humbled, amazed and invigorated by all the advances we see not only in the medical world globally, but also in the country.”
