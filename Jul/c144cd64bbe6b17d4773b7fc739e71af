General Manager, HR Operations, Global Manpower Limited, Kunle Agboola, has listed outsourcing as a strategic business option for maximising business growth. He stated this while speaking at the 2022 Outsourcing Expo organised by Global Manpower Limited, a subsidiary of MacTay in partnership with The Association of Outsourcing Professionals of Nigeria (AOPN), yesterday, in Lagos. The conference themed ‘Top Post Pandemic Outsourcing Trends for Businesses – Opportunities and Threats’ focused on top outsourcing trends. “Outsourcing has certainly revolutionised how businesses operate today. When outsourcing first started, it was restricted to low-risk functions such as payroll management and data entry roles. Today we see that non-core functions, including contact centre operations, are being outsourced on a large scale. At Global Manpower, we are uniquely positioned to support our partners by leveraging the cost benefits of outsourcing high-end functions like IT and other BPO services to reliable companies like ours. “Outsourcing is no longer a buzzword only for low-cost labor, it has become a key business strategy for both small and large business enterprises that believe in devoting 100 per cent to their key business operations and outsourcing the rest to specialized vendors,” Agboola said. Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Xown Solutions Ltd, Segun Akande, has emphasised the need to continually drive conversations around technology automation in Nigeria to position outsourcing on a global scale. The expo included panel sessions on opportunities and threats from entrepreneurial and business perspectives, business networking sessions, and exhibition opportunities.
