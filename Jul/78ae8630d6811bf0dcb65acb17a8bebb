Joe Aribo admits when the ball hit the back of the net for his Europa League opening goal, he didn’t know what to do, reports rangersreview.co.uk. The Nigerian international scored after 57 minutes when he capitalised on an error in the Eintracht Frankfurt defence, sending Rangers fans into dreamland. The Germans would equalise twelve minutes later and win the trophy on penalties. But the goal is a moment that will live with £10m Southampton signing Aribo forever more. “It was surreal,” he said. “I don’t think words can describe how I felt out there. I didn’t know what to do or how to celebrate. I lost all.. “I saw my family, even that, seeing them right there celebrating was an amazing feeling. “Rangers is a real family. It holds a big place in my heart. The fans are amazing, my teammates, the staff.” The 26-year-old also reflected on winning the title with Rangers, putting the club back on top of Scottish football for the first time in a decade. “That season was crazy,” he said. “We were going into games feeling like we can overpower and beat anyone. “That was a really good season for us and just showed how good we could be when we put our mind to it.”
