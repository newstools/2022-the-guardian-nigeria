The monosyllabic space hero’s animated “Guardians of the Galaxy” spinoff, “I Am Groot,” has debuted its first trailer. The “I Am Groot” clip will provide you with some answers to your questions about how Marvel would create a full series about a superhero who only speaks in three words. During San Diego Comic-Con 2022, Marvel  revealed some forthcoming films and Disney Plus TV programs from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Guardians of the Galaxy character Groot appears in the animated short “I Am Groot”, where he engages in what appear to be a number of silly escapades involving cuddly aliens, a dance-off, and a leafy clothing. By making the episodes brief, Marvel can get past Groot’s limited speaking possibilities. Actually, the series is a compilation of five shorts. Groot is an extraterrestrial space creature known for his amiable nature and compassionate personality. He was first developed by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby in the 1960s comic book “Tales to Astonish.” In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Vin Diesel provides the voice of Groot. Despite being extremely intelligent, Groot can only say one thing at once: “I am Groot,” but those who are close to him, especially his frequent partner in crime Rocket Raccoon, can interpret what he means. Disney Plus will begin streaming “I Am Groot” on Wednesday, August 10. Watch the trailer here.
