Oxfam International, a charity organisation, in collaboration with Bauchi State Government, has trained and equipped over 30,000 residents on modernising a nutritious balanced diet for the locals. During a project monitoring visit to Azare, Katagum Local Council of the state, at the weekend, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning, Idris Giade, said the programme, which commenced about seven years ago, captured 30,000 beneficiaries in six local councils. Saleh, who is the Chairman, Steering Committee for Oxfam’s Livelihoods and Nutrition Empowerment (LINE) project, said: “Global Affairs, Canada, is sponsoring two projects – MEDA and this one through Oxfam’s LINE project. A component of the project has to do with Village Saving Loan (VSL), which affords the local farmers financial inclusion and contributes funds to access soft loans to improve their agribusiness.” Bauchi LINE Project Coordinator, Samuel Lashom, said that Oxfam is particularly interested in fighting poverty and hunger, and would be glad to have more programmes in the state.
