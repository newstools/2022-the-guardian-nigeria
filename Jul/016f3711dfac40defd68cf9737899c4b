The value of metaverse-related market activity could hit $2 trillion in global revenues by2030, but there is a risk of developers missing out on lucrative opportunities if the ecosystem fails to implement standards, encourage interoperability and educate consumers. This is according to a new report from analyst company ABI Research.  The breakthrough moment for bringing “the most transformative changes” to the metaverse and to the digital services field in general will come with the arrival and spread of mainstream smart glasses, the analyst predicted.
  
“This will occur across the consumer and enterprise markets, perhaps not at the same scale (or as widely) as smartphones, but these devices will start to unlock the full potential of the metaverse, especially as it applies to public spaces. This will also provide a better transition point for mobile markets to the metaverse”, noted Inouye. It is expected that such headsets will be widely available by the 2030s.
