The United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Nigeria, Matthias Schmale, has commended the Sterling One Foundation for supporting the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across Africa through its Impact Summit This was shared during the two-day hybrid event held in Abuja, which had about 4,000 registered delegates from 55 countries. Giving a keynote address at the event, themed, ‘Rethink, Rebuild, Recover, Accelerating Growth for the SDGs’, Schmale noted that the theme was apt, timely, relevant and required, given the economic regression across Africa occasioned by the pandemic and the volatility caused by the Ukraine war and the fact there were just 8 years to go before 2030. CEO, Sterling One Foundation, Mrs. Olapeju Ibekwe, noted that the summit had in-depth and insightful panel sessions on climate action, education access and funding, primary healthcare, youth and gender empowerment, impact investment and governance, linked with the 17 global goals. She added that a recurring resolution that came through in all the panel sessions was the need for the elimination of silo executions and the embracing of collaborations by all sector players. Financing strategies, impact measurement and evaluation of such were also discussed, as it was clear that the SDGs require financing to become a reality with an estimated amount of $1.3 trillion yearly in Africa. “Various deals from four African countries were brought to the summit’s deal room with innovative solutions that cut across education, health, construction, renewable energy and food security. Most of these businesses already have conditional commitments from our investors at the event and we expect to seal these deals in the coming weeks by working with the investees. We will continue facilitating financing for purpose and profit-driven business solutions that will help promote access to health and education for all while guaranteeing returns for impact investors locally and globally,’’ she said.
