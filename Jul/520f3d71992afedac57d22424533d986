Former international, Friday Elahor, has described as a good omen the movement of some Super Eagles players to big clubs in Europe, saying that the deals would impact the national team positively. Joe Aribo and Taiwo Awoniyi recently signed for English sides, Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively, while Calvin Bassey just joined Ajax of Amsterdam. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Elahor said he was happy with the threesome, whose movement to big clubs, he said, would better their lives apart from the impact it would have on Super Eagles. “Aribo, Bassey and Awoniyi’s movements were made possible by the sterling performances in their immediate past clubs. It is a good thing that our players are moving from smaller clubs to the big league,” he said. On new Super Eagles’ Head Coach, Jose Peseiro’s visit to NPFL league venues, Elahor said looking inwards for players for the national team has become mandatory for the manager, adding: “That was exactly what Coach Clemence Westerhof did when he was in charge of the Eagles where he uncovered new players. “His effort is a good development for our domestic league players and I think this is the time for them to work harder to make the Eagles team.”
