Organisers of one of the country’s premier golf competitions, the Nigeria Cup, have revealed that preparation has started for the 25th edition of the event. It is billed to hold from September 24 to October 1 at the golf section of Ikoyi Club 1938. The Nigeria Cup is organised yearly by the Ikoyi Golf Community Nigeria Association, (IGCNA). According to IGCNA Chairman, Chief Felix Majekodunmi, this year’s tournament will be a success as it is already generating much interest within the golf circuit. A committee saddled with the task of organising this year’s edition has been put in place, he said, adding that former Lagos Open Golf Champion, Peter Eben-Spiff, is heading the committee. He disclosed that the committee has been working hard to raise funds to organise a befitting Nigeria Cup golf tournament. Corporate sponsors and individuals, he added, have been enquiring on how to be part of the famous competition. Majekodunmi revealed that the weeklong competition will involve children, staff of the golf section, caddies, professionals, ladies, men and invited guests. “Over the years, apart from the course action, proceeds from the competition have also been used to impact on the golfing environment,” he said. “Played yearly since its debut in 1997, the Nigeria Cup is one of the most sought after competitions in Ikoyi Club 1938. It was started to celebrate Nigeria’s Independence anniversary. As we mark the 62nd anniversary of our great nation, it is hoped that this tournament will create an atmosphere for harmony through recreation,” he said.
