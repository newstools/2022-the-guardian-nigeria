According to him: “The sad event of their abduction occurred around 5.45 pm of July 15, 2022, when the two priests were on their way to a function at a different parish in Lere Local Government Area of Kaduna State. “We solicit for intense prayer for their quick and safe release, we equally wish to call on all and sundry to refrain from taking the laws into their hands. “We will use every legitimate means to ensure their quick and safe release,” the Catholic chancellor said. “May Jesus crucified on the Cross listen to our prayers and hasten the unconditional release of His priests and all other kidnapped persons.” The unfortunate kidnapped of the two priests happened a few weeks after three Catholic priests were abducted in the state. While the two were released, one was kidnapped on his way to the farm.
