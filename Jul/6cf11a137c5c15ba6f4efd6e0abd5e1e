In an interview with Skynews, Gosling said he wants to take part in a Bollywood film. The actor revealed this being determined to avoid being typecast in a field where performers are sometimes labeled as one-trick ponies. “I want to do a Bollywood film. I got to work with [Indian actor] Dhanush in this film, and I loved working with him, but also just seems like such an interesting like way to make films. I love them, I love the energy of them, they’re really unique and feels like that would be a fun thing to team up with him and make something there.” The actor’s upcoming endeavor would see him playing Ken in a live-action film based on the iconic toys, going from action star to Barbie doll. On the the comparisons of being a secret spy and James Bond film he said,”I think you can’t kind of step into it without those comparisons and we even acknowledge it in the movie.” He continued, “I mean there’s one point where he says [the alias] 007 was taken – I like the idea that this movie existed in a world that was aware that there were Bond movies and this was a different take on it, a less glamorised version of it. With Daniel Craig’s departure leaving the role of James Bond up for grabs, it doesn’t seem to be something the Ontario-born Gosling sees in his future. I’m not sure anyone’s, you know, asking for that, I don’t even think Canadians are asking for that, I don’t think anyone wants that.” After what seemed like a break, “The Gray Man” is Ryan Gosling fisrt film since his 2018 “First Man”. The Place Beyond The Pines co-star Eva Mendes and the actor, 41, who has two daughters together, decided to take some time off to bond with his young family. He stated that because his girls are older now, they are able to travel with him and did so while he was in Europe filming “The Gray Man”. “We had a funny moment in this Prague sequence where I’m handcuffed to a bench and I got a call on my cell phone and I hid behind the bench and it was Eva,” Gosling said. And all these explosions were going off, and she was asking me how long the explosions were going to go on because the girls had a Zoom piano class and they were staying in a hotel nearby. It was funny, but it’s worked – they’re able to be with me while I work and they get to experience these cities as we travel.”
