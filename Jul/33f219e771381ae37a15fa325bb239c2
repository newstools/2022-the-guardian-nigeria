‘Gino Rufinato’s Story Is Fake’ Sports minister, Sunday Dare, has dismissed as ‘fake news reports that a British sportswear manufacturer had to answer a Save Our Soul (SOS) call from Nigeria’s Commonwealth team over kits. Some media reports yesterday suggested that Gino Rufinato, manager of the MG Sportswear firm, which is based in a town near Birmingham, provided kits for the Team Nigeria contingent at the Games after it thought at first it was a “wind-up” before launching his 14 staffs into action. According to the report, Rufinato’s team had to make 200 pieces of kit, including running vests and shorts and staff tracksuits. “It’s wonderful.” Sports Minister, Sunday Dare (middle), and some Nigerian athletes display their kits at Abuja airport before their departure for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham…last week  However, the Special Assistant to the Sports Minister on Media, Toyin Ibitoye, told The Guardian yesterday that it was ‘fake news.” “Team Nigeria came with its official kits from Abuja last week,” he stated. About 300 Team Nigeria Kits were delivered over two weeks ago and have since been issued to almost all the athletes. These kits, which are the general kits procured by the Ministry of Youth and  Sports Development, as is the practice, have since been issued to the athletes. These include tracksuits, house wear, sneakers, face caps, backpacks, trolley bags, shorts, and ceremonial wear. He continues: “However, the competition kits for each federation differ. Each federation produces specific competition kits for its athletes. The Ministry is aware that federations have their own arrangements with different manufacturers with different delivery times and expectations which are being monitored very closely. “We hope this clarification helps to put the matter in perspective so that all distractions to Team Nigeria athletes and officials are avoided.”
