• As Akindele’s Dep Gov Candidacy Splits Opposition Party The 2023 governorship election in Lagos State might be the worst, in terms of performance, for the major opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) if development within the party is anything to go by.  Akindele’s Nomination As Running Mate
PRIOR to the unveiling of Funke Akindele as running mate to Adediran on Wednesday, July 13, 2023, there had been rumours that Jandor had singlehandedly nominated her without carrying the party members along. The insinuation was initially denied until it was confirmed.
 
Aside from the fact that Jandor himself announced the actress as his running mate, Akindele, in a video on her Instagram page, also announced that she is the running mate to Adediran. She said it was an opportunity for her to help liberate and improve the wellbeing of the people, particularly the deprived youth, women and the girl child.
  
The state chairman of the party, Philip Aivoji, confirmed the choice of Akindele to The Guardian on the telephone yesterday, saying, “All I can say is that Funke Akindele has been chosen and confirmed as running mate to our candidate for the 2023 governorship election in Lagos State. And as we speak, we are showcasing her as our running mate in the Ikorodu division to our members.”
