Muslim faithful, yesterday, bemoaned the hike in prices of rams and food items, against expectations that prices will be more affordable this year compared to 2021.  The Chairman, Lagos State Ram Sellers Association, Gbagada Abubakar Langa, simply told The Guardian that the hike is  compounded by increase in price of diesel. “Everything has increased in Nigeria.  So, it’s not about us.”
 Also, a buyer at the Gbagada ram market, Ajibola Samsudeen, lamented over the 45 per cent increase.  Another reason the prices are high is because of bandits and kidnappers, who have taken over parts of the country.
