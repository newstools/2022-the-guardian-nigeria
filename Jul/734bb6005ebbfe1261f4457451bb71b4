Borno State Ministry of Health has reported four cases of monkey pox in Gwoza and Biu local councils. Meanwhile, some communities have pledged to adopt and implement measures to prevent the outbreak of monkey pox, cholera and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) across the state. They made the pledge, yesterday, in Maiduguri, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) flagged off sensitisation campaigns and emergency responses in four councils. The preventive measures, including vaccination, are conducted in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council (MMC), Jere, Konduga and Marte councils and other hard-to-reach areas in the state. According to the UN health agency, there were reported cases of monkey pox in the neighbouring state of Adamawa. Health experts explained that monkey pox is a virus that belongs to the family of Pox Ride occurring in humans. The North East WHO Health Emergency Manager, Dr. Richard Lako, said the 30-day sensitisation campaign was to prepare and step up measures against monkey pox and cholera in four councils. Youth Leader of Bulumkutu Community, Bala Garba, said: “We have resolved to embrace the preventative measures of WHO and adopt its health emergency responses to save our lives. “This sensitisation campaign is good. We are mobilising our women and men to accept this awareness project. It is good for our health and wellbeing.”
