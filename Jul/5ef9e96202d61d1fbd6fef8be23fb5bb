Lagos-bound commuters, on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, have lamented the worsening traffic situation at Kara Cattle market section of the road.  “So, we are working with Julius Berger and the Federal Ministry of Works. From the design, the toll gate is coming and they are going to extend that area almost 100 metres on either side of the area.  We want to know the spaces they are going to occupy, so we are going to move in so much more into the cattle market itself. “There is a design for that area, so we want the Federal Ministry of Works to move in and take care of spaces they would need for that reconstruction, then we will continue our development immediately.  “So, there is going to be a major construction in that area. We have not abandoned the area, we are just waiting for the Federal Ministry of Works to come in and start the construction and we will tidy up, so we have to come from behind.”
  
Also, South-West Zone Director, Highways, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Adedamola Kuti,  an engineer, said works will soon start on the axis.
 
He promised to look into the situation with a view to checking the menace of traders in the Kara Cattle market section of the expressway.
