Acting Corps Marshal of the Federal Roads Safety Corps, Dauda Biu, has issued a stern warning against all forms of extortion, bribery, corruption and any misconduct by patrol men. Biu said the agency will not tolerate any action that ridicules and puts the FRSC in a bad light in the eye of the public. In a communique, the Corps Marshall charged commanding officers across board to caution operatives under their purview against incivility, patrol misconduct and unprofessional behaviour in the discharge of their duties. Biu said “The FRSC Management will not tolerate incivility towards members of the public, as well as any unprofessional conduct that will bring disrepute to the image of the corps. “Field operations must be intelligence-driven, and personnel must be aware and understand the peculiar challenges within their general operation areas and adjust operational activities to boost intelligence gathering.” The FRSC helmsman particularly directed the 12 zonal commanding officers to immediate effect the visit component commands under their jurisdictions of influence, and assess their immediate needs and challenges for necessary intervention at the forward national headquarters in Abuja.
