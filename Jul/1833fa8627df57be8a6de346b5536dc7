• Aviation Experts Warn Of Heavy Toll On Travellers • Exorbitant Air Fares Imminent
• NANTA Urges FG To Prioritise Repatriation Of Airlines’ Funds As Going Concern
• Trapped Funds In Nigeria A Quarter Of Funds Stuck Globally – IATA 
• ‘Airlines Recovering From Pandemic, In Dire Need Of Funds To Sustain Operations’ Barring a quick intervention from the Federal Government, air travellers, and the industry could be jolted in the days ahead as the unrepatriated funds for foreign airlines accruing from sales of flight tickets in local currencies hit the $600m mark at the end of June.  Findings by The Guardian showed that the stuck fund was in excess of $800 million in November 2021. It was brought down to about $283 million as at March this year, further increased to $450 million in May, and according to estimates, has now reached about $600 million as at June ending. Though not peculiar nor new to Nigeria, the aviation industry was in similar condition in 2016 when foreign airlines were unable to pull out funds from the official window, hence trapped funds rose to $600 million (about N120 billion). That led a couple of foreign airlines to exit the Nigerian route at that trying time. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the clearing house for over 280 airlines globally, had also recently raised the alarm over the steady rise in the amount of unrepatriated funds in Nigeria and other countries.  About this time in 2016, foreign airlines’ accumulated stuck fund reached a record high of $600 million. At the time, authorities were apt to blame the global slump in the price of crude oil and attendant decline in foreign reserve. More so, it was at the time a fairly new administration was still trying to find its feet in the economic puddle.
 
Fast-forward to 2022, the rack-up is back to the 2016 threshold. And quite different this time, is the boom in the oil market with the price of crude oil now over $110/barrel, though weaker value of Naira to the Dollar, and a reason for both airlines and travel agencies to be worried over the backlog.
  
Last November, foreign airlines operating in and out of Nigeria had taken protests to the CBN over difficulties in repatriating accumulated funds and soon got reprieve. Now, they are back on the curve. The Guardian learnt that the foreign airlines are most worried because they are just recovering from the pandemic, racking up debts and cash crunch, and in dire need of all the funds they can rake in to sustain operations. Experts noted that the consequences of the challenge would be felt, in the immediate, as a heavy toll on air travellers. Besides the foreign airlines withdrawing services in extreme cases, the immediate effects will be on airfares, and the travel agencies are already feeling the pinch.
 
In the November episode, foreign airlines had adjusted the Rate of Exchange (RoE) from N411 to N450, raising airfares some notches to mitigate losses of having funds tied down in the economy. The add-on cost to be passed to air travellers this time around, is yet undecided.  Chief Executive Officer of Finchglow Holdings, Bankole Bernard, reckoned that the concerns raised by the foreign airlines were genuine and deserving of urgent attention.  Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has, however, raised hopes of an urgent resolution, saying that the government was as concerned as the airlines, on getting the stuck funds repatriated.
 
Sirika earlier urged the Federal Government to grant the aviation industry a special foreign exchange window to defray stuck funds and also ease the Jet A1 scarcity rocking the sector.
 
He said: “It is pertinent to mention that we stand to gain significant benefits in restoring and maintaining connectivity within, to and fro the country. Analysis from IATA shows that the aviation sector contributes N341 billion to GDP, 160,000 local jobs and N535 billion revenue from visitors.
 
“However, the aviation business suffers from the issue of access to foreign exchange by local and foreign airlines and the ability to repatriate blocked funds. I would like to humbly request the support of the Central Bank, through the directive of Mr. President, to prioritise access to forex for all carriers both local and foreign, and to work out a mechanism to clear the existing backlog urgently and prevent subsequent build up,” Sirika said.
