The value of global trade has increased by approximately $1 trillion in the first quarter of the year to hit $7.7 trillion compared to the same period last year, according to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
   
The growth, which represents an increase of about $250 million from the immediately preceding quarter, is driven by higher commodity prices as trade volumes have increased to a much lesser extent.
   
UNCTAD Global Trade Update said although it is expected to remain positive, trade growth has continued to slow during the second quarter of 2022.
