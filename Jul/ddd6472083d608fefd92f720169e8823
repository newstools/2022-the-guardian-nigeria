Apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, stated that the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, Mr. Peter Obi, remains exceptional politician. National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze, Alex Ogbonnia, disclosed this while felicitating with the former governor of Anambra State on his 60th birthday. Ogbonnia noted that Obi served as governor and left office without tarnishing his image. He described Obi as a game changer, soldier of morals, democracy archetype, the popular sentiment of youth politics, prudent resource manager and ethnic barrier-breaker. He noted that the Obi trajectory is dotted with ingenuity and resourcefulness. Ogbonnia further said that while Obi was busy setting standards of good governance for posterity, “other myopic, timid and mundane governors were busy with acquisition of wealth to the detriment or impoverishment of the masses that voted them into office.” The Ohanaeze scribe added that current events in the Nigerian democratic space is a lesson to the incumbent and, indeed, to generations unborn. “What goes for Obi today is the quality service he rendered to his people as governor; and, of course, the humility, character and intellectual acumen that define his public conducts. “Today, Obi is embraced by the oppressed, dispossessed and the downtrodden, as well as visibly depressing to oppressors and political marauders.” The Igbo group noted that Obi has built a reputation for himself; and this is being reflected in the current obi phenomenon, which has resulted in the current massive Obi movement. Ogbonnia further said: “Obi is today respected and accepted across Nigeria, not because of his wealth but his power of good over evil, light over darkness and virtues over vices. “The President General of Ohanaeze, Prof. George Obiozor, feels happy that the rejected stone has become the corner stone that gravitates the Nigerian grassroots, including influential men and women.”
