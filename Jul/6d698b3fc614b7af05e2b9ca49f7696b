The Association of Corporate Affairs Managers of Banks (ACAMB) has advocated an active collaboration of fiscal and monetary authorities in addressing all constraints impeding the growth of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) and providing support for the real sector. At a media briefing to announce ACAMB’s 1st National Stakeholders Conference in collaboration with OPS, slated for Wednesday, August 3, 2023, Ex-ACAMB President, Eddy Ademosu, cited the effect of the macro-economic headwinds on business operations in Nigeria and stressed the need for the authorities to develop a more focused strategy that will empower indigenous operators and stimulate their interest to invest. According to him, if the government should reassess its fiscal and monetary policy and ensure that it supports productivity and the real sector, it would attract more investment into the country. He pointed out that a macro-economic environment that has deteriorated so severely that it could not support a viable productive sector does not augur well for the economy. “Everything revolves around the government, their initiatives and policies. Once they harmonise those sectors, we can begin to see the impact on the economy. Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing. Controlling and allowing both fiscal and monetary policies to come together in a way that even the exchange rate will stabilize is what is critical at this time.” Earlier, ACAMB President, Rasheed Bolarinwa, said the conference would proffer lasting solutions to the constant discord between the industry and the OPS. He said addressing Nigeria’s economic challenges would be the major focus of the conference as far-reaching strategies that would help reposition the economy would be unfolded at the meeting.
