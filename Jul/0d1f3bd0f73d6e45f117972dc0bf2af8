Meanwhile, production for the Marvel sequel for “Black Panther” ended in March, and the film would hit cinemas on November 11th. Fans wanted Boseman to be replaced in the major role, but Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, said that T’Challa’s character would not be recast or digitally recreated. Fellow actor Letitia Wright previously stated that the film would “honour” the late Boseman, who passed away in August 2020 from colon cancer. Wright faced criticism in 2021 after sharing an anti-vax Twitter. She has, however refuted the assertion that she voiced anti-vaccine sentiments while filming Black Panther 2.
