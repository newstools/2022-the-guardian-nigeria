The actress made this statement this during discussions with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu at the Blackbox Roundtable. Ebuka recently featured Tacha, Ceec, Alex, Mercy Eke, Bisola, Tboss, Dorathy, and Erica as guests on his show titled “The It Girls of BBNaija.” Bisola responded when questioned about her views on marriage, “Baby please find me, I’m single and tired of being Independent I want to be dependent. “I’ve been independent since I was 17years.” She continued, “I’m 36 now I want to be married so I can give birth to another child before 38 oh.” The former female housemates, meanwhile, refuted claims that women from BBNaija receive financial support from older males after the programme. They contend that folks with those tales are simply insecure and that they work hard for their money. Bisola finished as Big Brother Naija’s first runner-up in 2017. At the 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards, she took home the AMVCA Trailblazer Award.
