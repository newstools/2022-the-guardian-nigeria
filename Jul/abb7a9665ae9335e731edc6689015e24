Angry natives, yesterday, set two suspected ritualists ablaze for the alleged defilement and death of a 10-year-old girl in Ede-Oballa, Nsukka Local Council of Enugu State. An eyewitness from the community, who pleaded anonymity, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the incident had thrown the community into sorrow. According to the source, the lifeless body of the girl was found in a nearby bush with vital organs removed. The source said: “The natives have been worried that ritualists have entered into the community. “Only ritualists will rape a girl to death and remove her vital organs for their evil acts. “That was why when residents heard that the perpetrators of the dastardly act had been arrested by the neighbourhood watch, everybody rushed to its office. “The crowd overpowered the security men, grabbed the two ritualists, set them on fire and watched them burn to death. “It’s the intention of the security men to take the suspects to the police but they were overpowered by the mob,” the eyewitness said.
