Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has assured that the conduct of the 2023 general elections would be taken a notch higher and would be the best ever in the nation’s history. Yakubu said this, yesterday when he received delegations of the International Republican Institute (IRI) and that of the National Democratic Institute (NDI), led by Secretary of the State of Ohio, United States, Frank LaRose, in Abuja. He said the commission would improve on successes recorded in the Ekiti and Osun governorship elections. He said: “We are encouraged by your kind words. But there is still a lot of work to do. We assure you that we will continue to work, not only hard but even harder to deliver the 2023 general elections. “As for the preparation for the 2023 general elections, I want to assure you that we promised Nigerians that Ekiti was going to be good, and Ekiti was a good election. We promised that Osun was going to be better; Osun was a better election.” “We are promising that the 2023 general elections will be our best election ever, and we are committed to delivering the best election ever.” Earlier, LaRose commended INEC on its efforts towards improving the conduct of elections in Nigeria. He said that as observers in the just concluded Osun governorship election, they witnessed, first-hand, an effort by INEC to continually deliver safe elections to Nigerians, even as he admitted there was room for improvement.
