The “Aquaman” and “Game of Thrones” actor’s Oldsmobile was struck on the front left side when a motorcycle rider crossed over into his lane, according to TMZ. According to reports, the rider was only slightly hurt after rolling over the truck and bouncing off Momoa’s windshield while Momoa suffered no harm. Momoa was driving on Old Topanga Canyon Road on Sunday near the Calabasas neighbourhood. During his drive, he collided with a biker riding the opposite way as they both came around a curve. Fortunately, the rider survived the impact after rebounding off Momoa’s windscreen, clearing the hood of his vehicle, and landing on the opposite side. After the crash, the cyclist was reportedly left standing up. After the collision, the injured cyclist was sent to the hospital with minor wounds, including bruising on their leg and a thumb injury. On the professional front, Jason’s next project is “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom”, set for release in March 2023. The actor has also made an appearance for the third season of his AppleTV+ program. The show’s trailer was made available over the weekend in preparation for the show’s comeback next month. This time in the series, the actor’s character will be seen fighting for his family.
