Custodians of democracy, including the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), religious and other organisations, have been urged to come together to salvage democracy in the country. Other custodians of democracy, which the National President of Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisation (CSOs), Chief Lazarus Nwachukwu, believed should as well unite with the Labour unions to redeem the nation’s democracy, are Council of Islamic Affairs in Nigeria (CIAN), Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and National Council of Women Society (NCWS). Nwachukwu, in a statement, yesterday, in Jalingo, Taraba State, expressed sadness at manner the country continued to drift backwards among the comity of nations. Asserting that the unions and organisations had long been in slumber, despite their democratic orientation, he stressed the need for them to rise up and take their rightful positions. The country is fast losing its glory, he said, urging that something positive must be done to ensure that democracy is redeemed in the country. Nigeria, according to him is yearning for remedies. “There is an urgent need for us to come together and work round the clock as a team to salvage democracy in this country. “The time has come for the real agents of democracy to come together to promote and sustain democracy. This can only be done by the civil society in Nigeria,” he said.
