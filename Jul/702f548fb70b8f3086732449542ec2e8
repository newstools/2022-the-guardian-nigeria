A holy man of a Hungarian castle seeks to thwart one of Genghis Khan’s armies from invading Europe in the historical drama “1242: Gateway to the West,” which was being promoted at the Cannes film market. According to “Variety,” Spacey was slated to play the holy man. However, when Spacey was accused in the UK with four counts of sexual assault and one count of inducing “a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent,” the film’s producer, Bill Chamberlain, tells ‘Variety’ that the lead role has now been filled by another actor. A new lead is now the subject of negotiations; their identity will be made public soon. In London on Thursday, Spacey entered a not guilty plea to every charge. On June 6, 2023, he will go on trial in the UK. The trial is anticipated to last three to four weeks. The English-language Gateway to the West, which will be helmed by Peter Soos, will start a two-month shoot on October 17. It will cost between $10 million and $25 million. Additionally, Spacey appears in the suspenseful film “Peter 5 Eight.” The producers of “Peter Five Eight” supported Spacey soon after he was accused of a crime. The producer said in a statement, “There are those who wish for him not to act, but they are outnumbered by fans worldwide who await an artist they have enjoyed for decades returning to the screen.” He continued, “The production has no knowledge or comment on the various swirling allegations and believes it’s a matter for the courts to determine validity if it exists.” Peter Five Eight’ is a film for fans who care more for the art than the scandal.” The UK’s Crown Prosecution Service, which spent more than a year evaluating a file given to them by the Metropolitan Police, announced the decision to charge Spacey. Spacey’s tenure at the Old Vic theater in London, where he held the position of artistic director from 2004 to 2015, is thought to be the cause of at least some of the accusations. The theater launched an internal investigation when the actor faced a wave of sexual assault claims in the US, and as reported by the BBC, 20 victims came forward to say he had been improper with them.
