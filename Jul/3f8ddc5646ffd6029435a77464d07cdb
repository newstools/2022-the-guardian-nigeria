Digitisation and industrialisation have gradually found their way into the creative sector, including fashion, creating a much larger audience and more forward-thinking innovation guaranteed to boost revenue. As this mix between fashion and innovation continues to grow hand-in-hand, many fashion businesses, including Nigerian-owned brands, are taking advantage of this digital transformation in fashion. VVS Lagos Fashion Show, for the first time, will offer dedicated experiences for both trade and public audiences through one dynamic schedule, keeping different realms of art and culture at its core. As digitisation in fashion continues to take the front lead in the Nigerian fashion industry, this showcase will highlight renowned Nigerian designers in a grandeur fashion show, that will bring forth art, culture, and technology to celebrate the creativity and innovation that Lagos is known for, such as T.I Nathan, Tjwho Kadiju, I.N Official, Re Lagos and Grayscale. To promote these advancements, it becomes clear that a unified approach by fashion leaders would smoothen the transformation process. A Panel session with industry leaders is curated to address fashion value chains and the socio-economic growth models of a journey from an idea to a brand. The Panel will also converse on how to leverage technology, finance, and branding to cultivate more homegrown labels. An interactive segment will be held with a Trunk sales show from high fashion renowned Nigerian designers alongside an art exhibit by Ken Nwadiogbu to cultivate a stronger creative platform for a growing community.
VVS Lagos will also be hosting the first ever done before, Awards for Lifetime Achievements to acknowledge and recognize the future of fashion beyond creativity. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1805486 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="941" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042.jpeg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042-813x598.jpeg 813w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042-320x235.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042-640x471.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG_2042-600x441.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> In response to the ever-changing fashion landscape and the growing public interest in Fashion in Nigeria, VVS Lagos was thus launched to have a new Fashion Week format to increase engagement and reach new audiences for designer businesses.
