The Lagos State University (LASU) has lamented the transportation challenges faced by students of the Badagry Campus of the institution. It has, therefore, appealed to Badagry Local Council to come to its aid, and assist in the transportation of the students.
  
The appeal was made when the director of the Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board (JUPEB) in the institution, Prof. Yunus Dauda,  led a team on a courtesy visit to the chairman of the council, Mr. Olusegun Onilude, at the council secretariat, in Ajara, yesterday.
   
Dauda, who said that one of the major challenges confronting LASU was transporting students to the campus explained that “the institution has tried several times to acquire a Marcopolo Bus for the students, but due to various constraints, we have not been able to do that. We will appreciate it if the chairman can help, through any means, as this will reduce the stress that the students are passing through.  “This has proved all I have heard about him wrong, and this means if we have people like him at the helm of affairs, this country will move forward. “What I saw in the chairman is not what is commonly seen in politicians today, which is why we are here,” Dauda said.
  
Responding, Onilude said that since the institution was part of his constituency, he would be concerned about its problems. I also appreciate you for coming in person, some would have just done this on paper. “When anyone comes around with a problem, we have to listen to him; if we can’t solve it, we should proffer some solutions. We will continue to work together so long as you require our services. “I have a relationship with LASU where I did two master’s degrees (MBA and Educational Management). I can’t rule out LASU in me and because it is our state university, we need to show concern about it,” he said.
