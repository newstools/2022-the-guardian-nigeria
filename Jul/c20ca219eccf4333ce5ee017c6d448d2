Gunmen have attacked a lodge where some members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) reside in Akwa Ibom State. The gunmen attacked the lodge at about 1:am on Wednesday, and dispossessed Corps members of their valuables at Udo Ekong Ekwere Street, off Information Drive, Uyo, the Akw Ibom State capital. NYSC management in the state confirmed the attack but dispels reports that corp members were raped. Akwa Ibom State NYSC Coordinator Chinyere Ekwe in a statement said she in company of the State Police Commissioner, Olatoye Durosinmi, visited the Corps members for an on-the-spot assessment,” Ekwe said. “While there, it was confirmed that 21 Corps members occupy the said property. The interaction with the Corps members further revealed that an attack on them was actually carried out by thieves at about 1am this morning. “In the process, the invaders took their valuables including phones, Laptops and some cash. They confirmed that NO bodily harm was meted on them, and NO CORPS MEMBER WAS RAPED.” She further asserted that while the actions and intentions of the criminal elements remain condemnable,  social media operators, and online media establishments should exercise restraint and not trivialize such unfortunate incident as the consequences on the psychology of parents and guardians of Corps members in the state would be dangerously affected. However, Mrs Ekwe disclosed that the State Commissioner of Police has assured the Corps members and members of the public that an investigation on the matter has been launched and that the culprits will soon be apprehended.
