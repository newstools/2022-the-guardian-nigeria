Listen to “Voice Note” EP here. More recently, T-Classic’s sound has been revamped. He rose to fame having delivered consistently a flurry of bangers that appealed particularly to the teen demographic until the arrival of the summer ready ‘Makaveli’ (2021) which eulogized his breakout era. This new EP however toes the path of a dynamic and improving, edgy, versatile talent that the Classic Boy is gradually advancing into. Voice Note is T-Classic’s sophomore EP offering following from his 2020 debut ‘Underrated’. The project encompasses 5 brand new tracks and a previously released single, Dangerous that set the ball in motion for what to expect from the EP. As the Classical Boy matures gracefully into a more confident sound, he continues to find expression from exploring his identity while experimenting with musical flavours in their variety, which are centered around themes in ecstasy, love and worldly pleasures. On this new EP, you will experience T-Classic in his introspective persona; crooning in mellow, soft rhythms but of course, not without his signature catchy vibe and expressive lyricism that binds the framework of the entire project together. This dose of the singing Classical Boy is indeed a welcome fix that arouses excitement for what’s yet to be unraveled in his coffers. See Voice Note EP tracklist below. Listen to “Voice Note”
