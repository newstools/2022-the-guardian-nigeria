While they killed three people at Unguwar Isyaka, they abducted the principal of the government-owned school at Yan Tabki, while cows and other domestic animals were rustled at Company Daudawa. The Guardian learnt that the other kidnapped persons were moved into a dreaded neighbouring forest, notorious as a haven for terrorists. During the attack, many people were injured while trying to escape from the terrorists.

Spokesperson for the police command in the state, SP Gambo Isah, was yet to respond to an inquiry on the incident at the time of this report. MANY people have reportedly been kidnapped, as bandits attacked Keke area of New Millennium City, Kaduna State, on Monday night. This was coming less than 24 hours after terrorists released three of the remaining 43 victims of the train attack in their custody. The Millennium City attack happened around 09:00 pm on Monday. Even as the state government is yet to issue a statement regarding the attack, men of the Millennium City Police Division were spotted in the area to ascertain the number of persons kidnapped. A resident said: “The kidnappers came around 9:00 pm in the rain. So, people were not alerted early enough, because the rain was heavy. They kidnapped many people. Most of the people kidnapped were just returning home from work during the attack and ran into the bandits.”
