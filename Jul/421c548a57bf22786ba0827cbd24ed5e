The International Association of Lions Club District 404BI Lagos has tasked governments, corporate organisations and well-meaning Nigerians on the rising cases of cancer among children. The new District Governor, Mrs. Kema Ashibuogwu, gave the charge, yesterday, at a parley in Lagos to create awareness of the disease. Ashibuogwu, who identified leukaemia as the most common type of cancer, followed by brain and other Central Nervous System (CNS) tumours, lymphomas, neuroblastoma, kidney tumours and malignant bone tumours, lamented that a lot of children are dying owingto lack of awareness and ignorance of the disease, hence the need for proactive measures and awareness. She said the club was passionate about providing support for children living with cancer and also working with local and international partners to achieve the objective. Ashibuogwu also said the club was planning to build caregivers’ home at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, where the caregivers could stay for just N500 per night. She stressed that the club could also consider procuring a cancer detection machine, which costs about N64 million.
