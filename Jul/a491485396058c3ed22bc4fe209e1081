Every year, the Marathon season begins with a call for registration. Registration is open to the public, and for local and global athletes. Bonny Island Marathon has recorded over 10,000 participants in the last 4 years. Internal data shows that over 80% of participants are young people between 18 – 35 years with about 25% aggregate appearance for women across the years. Inclusion is at the core of our planning; from making provisions to accommodate participants with special needs to making necessary provisions for safety and security. There is also a special category for secondary school students from selected public and private schools who will run for a chance to win scholarships as a way to encourage their educational pursuit while building up interests in sports. The Bonny Island Marathon in its mandate to spotlight and promote promising local athletes, sponsored its 2019 Marathon Winner, Nengiye Wilcox for the second time to the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon and the 2022 Okpekpe 10K Road Race. “We believe this presented him the opportunity to not only activate his career, but see competition from a professional and global perspective. At the Bonny Island Marathon, we believe in our people – young people with dreams of transforming our regional story with sports. We intend to multiply our impact that will produce many other Nengiye’s who will be competing at the global stage from the Bonny Kingdom.” Boma Halliday on the support given to Neginye by the Bonny Island Marathon. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1796270 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--1591x1152.jpg" alt="" width="1591" height="1152" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--1591x1152.jpg 1591w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--826x598.jpg 826w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--1536x1112.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--2048x1483.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--320x232.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--640x463.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1--600x434.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1591px) 100vw, 1591px" /> Announcement of the Bonny Island Board of Advisors The Bonny Island Marathon is looking to expand its cause beyond the Marathon activities while also paying attention to community stakeholders, influencers and sports development agencies.
