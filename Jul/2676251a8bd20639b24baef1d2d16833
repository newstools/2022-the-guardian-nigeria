Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Port Harcourt branch, has warned against self–medication, especially for those that have issues with ear, nose and throat (ENT), saying it destroys the body systems and, sometimes, leads to death. Chairman of NMA in the state, Prof. Chizindu Alikor, said it was worrisome that some residents neglect the otorhinolaryngology (ENT) cases because they consider them as minor areas of health, whereas, they are critical aspects of health and should be given prime attention. He said damage to the eardrum could affect the brain. He gave the advice, yesterday, in Port Harcourt during a lecture titled, “The Development of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT) in Rivers State” in remembrance of Dr Chimdi Afuluka Odu, who the association said sacrificed a lot to set up the ENT department at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital (UPTH) and Rivers State University Teaching Hospital. Alikor said: “ENT has significantly developed both in UPTH and RSUTH. Service delivery has improved strongly. ENT has a cure, the challenge we have is that people do a lot of self-meditation, maybe because they feel the ear pain is not a serious matter, so they will resort to self-medication, they will get ear drops and start pouring into the ear whenever they have challenges. “The ear, nose and throat are fundamental areas of the body and we have over 10 specialists and consultants in Rivers State. So, those who have challenges in these areas should go for specialist care. Poor treatments have led to worsening health problems, so residents should desist from self-medication and traditional remedies.” He noted that Odu laid a solid foundation in the medical profession in the state, especially in the otorhinolaryngology unit. The keynote speaker and consultant of otorhinolaryngology at UPTH, Dr Opubo Benedict Lilly -Tariah, said Odu’s exemplary leadership should propel others to emulate him and make the state, and country a better place for all.
