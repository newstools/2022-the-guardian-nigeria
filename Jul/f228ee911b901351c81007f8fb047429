According to the programmes of events, over 72 golfers are expected to feature in the tournament, which will be played on the shotgun format. Clubs across Ghana are expected to present their best players for the event, which will offer huge prizes, including phones, devices and trophies from sponsors. With the tee-off set for 8.00 a.m., the organisers have urged participants to be on time to ensure a successful competition. Over the years, the MTN Invitational Golf tournament has been one of the biggest events on Ghana’s golf calendar as distinguished golfers looked forward to sharing the course with other talented golfers. Apart from its competitiveness, it also provides the platform for business executives to meet and exchange ideas in a relaxed atmosphere.
