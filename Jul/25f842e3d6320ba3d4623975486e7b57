The 62-year-old “House of Cards” actor testified in court on the allegations of sexual assault related to his time serving as the creative director of a local theatre between 2005 and 2013. Four counts of sexual assault and one count of inciting another person to engage in penetrative sexual behaviour without consent were brought against the scandal-plagued actor. In addition, the 62-year-old entered a not guilty plea to a fifth count of inciting another person to engage in penetrative sexual intercourse without their permission. Before entering a “not guilty” plea in court, the actor, using his real name Kevin Spacey Fowler, was asked to give his name and address. A three to four-week trial is scheduled to begin on June 6 of the following year. The judge granted Mr. Spacey unrestricted bail and scheduled a subsequent hearing for early in 2023. At his first court appearance last month, his attorney said that Spacey strenuously refuted all charges. If convicted guilty of the most serious crime, Spacey could spend the rest of his life in jail. He may get a six-month jail sentence or an infinite fine if found guilty of sexual assault. Police questioned the two-time Oscar winner in 2019 over allegations made by numerous men that he abused them while serving as the creative director of London’s Old Vic theatre between 2005 and 2013. The alleged victims are now in their 30s and 40s. Between March 2005 and August 2008, four of the claimed attacks allegedly occurred in London; one allegedly occurred in Gloucestershire, England, in April 2013. Charges against the actor were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service in May, but they could not be filed until after his arrival on British territory last month. The actor, who came out as gay in 2017, expressed his confidence that he can successfully defend himself in court.
