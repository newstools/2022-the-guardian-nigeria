The National Population Commission (NPC) has selected three local councils in each senatorial district of Bauchi State for the trial census ahead of the 2023 exercise. Federal Commissioner in charge of Bauchi Office, Alh. Ibrahim Darazo, told journalists, yesterday, that NPC selected Zaki, Giade and Itas/Gadau local councils in Bauchi North; Dambam, Ningi and Darazo from Bauchi Central and Tafawa Balewa, Toro and Kirfi from Bauchi South. According to him, there are five Supervisory Areas (SAs) with five Enumeration Areas (EAs) and 110 functionaries of the Commission to ensure efficient trial. Mohammed said that the commission would ensure that all residents would be counted in the 2023 census, adding that the general election would not have a negative impact on the census, as many Nigerians believe.
