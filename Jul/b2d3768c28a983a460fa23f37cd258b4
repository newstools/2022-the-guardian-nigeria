According to Forbes’ 2022 list, the “Umbrella” singer sits at no.21 as the youngest self-made female billionaire in the US with a net worth of $1.4billion and the only woman under 40 on the list. The new mum is also the first billionaire of her native country Barbados. Rihanna is co-owner of beauty line “Fenty Beauty,” which generated $550 million in revenue in 2020. French luxury fashion conglomerate LVMH (Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton) owns the other half of the company. Meanwhile, she holds a 30% stake in her “Savage x Fenty” lingerie line. Back in March, Bloomberg reported that Savage X Fenty lingerie was working alongside advisors on an IPO that may be potentially valued at $3 billion. However, despite the impressive numbers, Rihanna has pointed out that she doesn’t focus on valuations and accolades. Back in 2019, Rihanna told ‘The New York Times Magazine’ that reaching financial milestones wouldn’t stop her from working. She also said, “My money is not for me; it’s always the thought that I can help someone else,” she said. “The world can really make you believe that the wrong things are priority, and it makes you really miss the core of life, what it means to be alive.” Other celebrities on the list of self-made women are Kylie Jenner ($600 million), Taylor Swift ($570 million), Beyoncé ($450 million), Kim Kardashian ($1.8 billion), Reese Witherspoon ($430 million), Serena Williams ($260 million), Sandra Bullock ($225 million), Madonna ($575 million), Kris Jenner ($230 million) and more. New Mum Rihanna welcomed her first child in May, a son with beau A$AP Rocky. TMZ breaking the news reported that the couple’s first child together was born on May 13 in Los Angeles; however, the baby’s name is yet to be confirmed. The beauty mogul first announced her pregnancy in January, debuting her bump in a series of pictures, walking hand in hand with boyfriend A$AP Rocky, sporting a long pink jacket buttoned only at the top, paired with a long bejewelled necklace over her bare belly.
