Traders of Oshodi Market, Lagos, have applauded troops of the 9 Brigade, Ikeja Cantonment of the Nigerian Army, for conducting sanitation exercise in Oshodi, Lagos State. Expressing their delight, the traders said the act would further boost healthy relationships between civilians and soldiers in the state. Some of the places cleared by the soldiers include: the pedestrian bridge, drainages and the walkway along the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridor. A trader, Aminat Bodurin said: “ When I saw the soldiers I almost ran away but when I saw them sweeping and cleaning the drainage I became calm. “I have never seen soldiers cleaning the road. This is my first time, but I am happy. The gutter here has been loaded with refuse, even the bridge is worse. Seeing them cleaning is a good omen.” A shoe trader, Chiamaka Eze said: “ We traders usually engage in weekly cleanup, but the sanitation supports from the soldiers showed that we are really one. “ Speaking during the exercise, the Brigade Commander, Brig. Gen Isang Akpaumontia, represented by the Garrison Commander, Lt Col. Tahir Abdallah, said the  exercise was part of activities lined up for the Nigerian Army Day celebration, which comes up on July 6. “It is to support the people in the area of sanitation and hygiene and to show a good example of how it is important to maintain a high level of hygiene. “9 Brigade covers most areas of Lagos State. We have units in Owode, Ikorodu , Ojo as well as in Surulere,” he said. He stressed that others activities include, medical outreach in Onigbongbo and distribution of exercise books to schools.
