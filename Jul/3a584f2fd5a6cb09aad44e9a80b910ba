Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has called on the Federal Government to immediately put up measures to end the prolonged industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). In a statement he signed, yesterday, the lawmaker said incessant strikes by the lecturers could lead to poor quality of graduates. He called on both parties to stop playing with the future of Nigerian youths who have been at home for over five months. The statement reads: “Incessant strikes disrupt the academic calendar, encourage brain drain and contribute significantly to poor quality of graduates in the country, with far-reaching implications for national development.” “The Federal Government should urgently take all necessary measures to open a realistic negotiation with ASUU to stop the strike and implement signed agreements in the interest of our students, their parents, the education sector and the country. We must stop playing with the future of our youths.” Recall that ASUU on February 14 shutdown all public universities, protesting the inability of the Federal Government to implement agreements the two parties entered into in previous years.
