sir: Lagos State needs to start work on next year’s election and now is the time. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been strengthened by the Osun victory in South West. Oyo and Osun are indication that the party has really re-engineered its strategy. If 1+1 is no longer 2, then, the tacticians must go back to the drawing board. If reliance on midfield is no longer active, then, wingers and defence must be strengthened by APC in Lagos.
A strong reconciliatory body must be constituted immediately to work more on Epe, Badagry, Ikorodu, Eti-Osa & Ibeju-Lekki and Alimosho. A quick re-evaluation of on-going works must be personally monitored by the Governor and his Commissioners and not rely on the lies of leaders whose reports might lead the Party to a struggling position like the case of Osun. The division and disaffection already created by proxy reports of the midfielders seems not to be working as expected. Roads Contractors should be sanctioned and prosecuted accordingly, if the interest of the success of the state and her people are not considered for gains at the next election. The Lagos Badagry road gave former Lagos State Governor Babatunde Fashola a huge success due to his personal supervision of contractors, while same road caused a collosal damage to Akinwunmi Ambode who couldn’t secure a re-election. Enough of total dependence on past records, the APC as a party should see every election as a serious affair and not depend on some fence seaters in the name of some party leaders.
