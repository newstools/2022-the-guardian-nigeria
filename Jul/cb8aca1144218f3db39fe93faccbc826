The President of Awka Council of Kingmakers in Awka South Council of Anambra State, Ozo Jeef Oburah, has said the unending leadership crises in the community would only abate if it were broken into seven autonomous communities. Obuorah, who spoke to The Guardian at Amansea, near Awka, the state capital, yesterday, traced the factionalisation of leadership in the community to what he described as ‘unpopular insertion of role of Ozo title-holders in the 1986 Awka Chieftaincy,’ leading to the relegation of ‘usurpation of powers of Ndichie ukwu (council of elders),’ who are 80 years and above. Obuorah pointed out that Ozo titleholders were, before then, Ndichie ukwu (highest ruling class) and Ndichie nta (lower-ranking ruling class), like the coopted Ozo titleholders regardless of their age, who were below Ndichie ukwu, saddled with the role of administering leadership role. He said: “Today, the Ozo titleholders are claiming to be the Ichie ukwu, relegating the Ichie ukwu in the governance of Awka town. It is like a coup used by the aristocrats to bring them to power by usurping powers of the Adichie. “The relegation of Ndichie is the reason for the chieftaincy crises in Awka. Unless the issue is resolved and given legitimacy to the pre-1986 Awka Chieftaincy Constitution, as amended, the centre cannot hold.”
