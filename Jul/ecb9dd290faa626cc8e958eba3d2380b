Combining elements of Afrobeats and amapiano with Aluna’s pitch-perfect vocals, ‘Nowhere To Hide’ is a smooth, poignant track with romance at its heart. It follows ‘Mine O’ Mine’, Aluna’s collaboration with Jayda G. “Kooldrink’s sense of melody is exceptional and deeply emotional which is what I live for — I sent Kooldrink a track I’d written with Nigerian artists Prettyboy D-O (known for pioneering the current Alté wave) and Higo in London last year. What’s beautiful about this song is that it brings together four people from across the world that are pushing boundaries, and pays homage to the Amapiano sound in South Africa.” – Aluna ‘Nowhere To Hide’ is the latest in a long line of Afrobeats-adjacent collaborations for Aluna, who in the last couple of years has linked up with Tekno (who recently reached #1 on the Nigerian charts), Guilty Beatz (executive producer for Tems) and Rema, as well as co-curating Dance Red Saves Lives with Don Jazzy and Mavin Records. This followed her words on the narrow, eurocentric definition of dance music, and its impact on diversity and growth of the genre. Aluna is one-half of AlunaGeorge and builds upon the UK electronic duo’s sound in a solo context to venture further into eclectic dance-pop territory. She debuted with 2020’s stylistically elastic Renaissance, with follow-up standalone singles ‘Trouble’ and ‘Forget About Me’ appearing in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Blending his unorthodox creativity with an allure of lively rhythms and active vocals, Prettyboy D-O is a new age artist who exudes pure vitality. The Nigerian singer, songwriter and performer is a trailblazer changing the way African music is viewed all over the globe. Kooldrink is a South African DJ, sound engineer and record producer. At just 20-years-old, he has already worked on projects with Sho Madjozi, DJ Maphorisa, Rudeboyz, Diplo, Shane Eagle, Ganja Beats, Youngsta CPT and many more. ‘Nowhere To Hide’ sees Aluna continue with her fruitful run of cross-continental musical collaborations.
