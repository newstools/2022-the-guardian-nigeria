   Chief Executive Officer of SRAP, Relindis Mbu, while interacting with journalists over the weekend at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, said Nigeria would soon return to basketball’s elite ranks with the right coaching and training resources. She said that the organisation decided to host a globally recognised coaching workshop with famous basketball skills coach, Ganon Baker, in order to achieve the goal. While explaining the choice of Ganon Baker, one of the most respected figures in the world of basketball, Relindis said the American has been into training and coaching for over three decades, working with the NBA, WNBA, CBA, Euro League, NCAA, NJCAA, among others. He is also a former Nike Skill Development Trainer and Workout Director. “At SRAP, we are passionate about bringing in experts from the world with a tactical experience that can help develop our young talents. “The training clinic and certification programme with the renowned Ganon Baker will hold at the Package B, Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, from August 15 to August 20, and it will move to Lagos from August 22- August 27, at the OBN Academy Facility,” she said. According to Relindis, SRAP is working with Baker because of his vast experience in the game and his systematic curriculum that takes young players from zero to professional level. “Ganon Baker is committed to contextualizing his comprehensive Zero-To-Pro curriculum for basketball coaches and athletes in Nigeria, hosting live sessions in Nigeria at least four times a year, as well as live trainings with eligible Nigerian athletes and coaches in his state of the art basketball facility in Florida, USA. “He has opened up access to his strong network of talent management and within the global basketball ecosystem.” Chief Operating Officer of SRAP, Terfa Akpoyibo, also said that the coaching clinic with Baker would be a continuous programme, and would go a long way in developing Nigeria’s grassroots basketball.
