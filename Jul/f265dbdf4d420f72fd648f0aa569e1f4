Pension Fund Administrator (PFA), Sigma Pensions, said it is committed to improving customer relationships as well as strengthening the delivery of quality services to retirees across the country. In a  statement, the firm’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Dave Uduanu, described customer service as the badge every organisation wants to wear as satisfied customers remain loyal to organisations and recommend them to others. Giving the assurance, Uduanu said the firm is renowned for its commitment to improving its customer services and sustaining a competitive edge in customer service. He noted that as of December 31, its capital requirement was N5.5 billion, which surpassed the required N5 billion minimum operating capital stipulated by the National Pension Commission (PenCom). According to him, revenue and assets under management (AUM) grew between 13 to 15 per cent, which is strikingly above the industry average, noting that Sigma Pensions has had an outstanding track record of delivering competitive returns in all the various classes of fund. “One of the advantages of choosing Sigma Pensions is that we are one of the better performing managers in the market. Last year, five of our public funds were ranked among the top five in the industry, which is good – meaning that you get good returns on investment. “We also have very good customer service. We are proactive, as we have deployed very good technology solutions to allow our customers to have seamless access to our services. So, on the balance, we are one of the top PFAs in terms of the key parameters of investment returns, customer service, and technology savvy. Also, we have a young and energetic workforce,” he said.
