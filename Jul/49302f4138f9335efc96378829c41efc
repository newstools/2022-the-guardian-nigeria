The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan has debunked the news trending on the social media, alleging he is withholding letters of some Senators planning to defect from the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to a statement by his media adviser, Yomi Awoniyi, issued yesterday, in Abuja, he said the story insinuated that Lawan was sitting on the purported letters to protect his position as the President of the Senate. “We have seen a story on social media and some online newspapers purporting that the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, is sitting on letters from some Senators allegedly intimating him of their defections from the APC. “We hereby state categorically that the story is utter falsehood as there is no such letter before the Senate President. The report mentioned only Senator Adamu Bulkachuwa as one of the affected Senators. “Obviously, the purveyors of the syndicated lies had not even bothered to confirm from the Senator if and when he submitted any such letter to the Senate President. “It is public knowledge that the Senate President has always promptly read out letters by Senators defecting from one party to another. The Senate President is sufficiently knowledgeable about the rules and workings of the Senate and has been discharging his responsibilities within the ambit of those rules. “We wish to reiterate that the Senate President is not withholding or sitting on any letter of whatever content from any of his distinguished Senator colleagues.  Therefore, any story purporting such exists only in the imagination of the mischief makers circulating it.”
