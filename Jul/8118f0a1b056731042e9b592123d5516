South Africa, yesterday, continued their recent dominance of Nigeria in women’s football by beating the Super Falcons 2-1 in their opening group game of the ongoing African Women Cup of Nations held in Morocco. The last time the teams met in Lagos, the much younger South African girls defeated Nigeria 4-2 to win the Aisha Buhari Cup. Yesterday, there was no doubt that the Banyana Banyana had Falcons’ numbers as they dominated the first half and a better part of the second stanza. Their dominance paid the right dividends in the second half when Seoposenwe opened the scoring in the 60th minute after some good work by Cesane. The South Africans, led by their former skipper, Desire Ellis, made it 2-0 two minutes later through Hildah Magia, who latched onto a fine pass by Thembi Kgatlana before slotting beyond the on-rushing Tochukwu Oluehi. Nigeria pulled one back in the stoppage time through Rasheedat Ajibade, but it was too little too late as the South Africans held on to draw the first blood in what promises an exciting contest for the trophy between the 2018 finalists. Nigeria will meet Botswana in their second game on Thursday, while South Africa will play Burundi same day. The Super Falcons will round off their group stage fixtures on Sunday against Burundi, while Banyana Banyana will meet Botswana.
