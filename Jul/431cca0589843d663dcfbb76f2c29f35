After eight years of litigation, the Baaleship of Egbe Community in Kogi State has been resolved in favour of Oba Abiodun Agbana. The stool, by hierarchy, is second to the first-class stool of the Elegbe of Egbe and the automatic successor to the Elegbe throne. The emergence of Agbana, a former Managing Director of Onward Fishery, Lagos, followed the June 22, 2022 judgment of the Kogi State High Court, Kabba. Two other contestants for the stool had gone to court to challenge his (Agbana) selection, but both cases failed for different reasons.
