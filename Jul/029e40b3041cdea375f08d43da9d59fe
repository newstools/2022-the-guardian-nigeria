Power generating set dealer, Mikano International Limited, has denied any link with presidential flag-bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. The Adamawa indigene has severally been identified with the company by social media as a shareholder, claiming if elected, he would worsen Nigeria’s electricity woes. Established in 1993, Mikano competes in a number of sectors, including automotive, power generation, as well as generating set, electrical products and steel fabrication. Stories of the former Vice President having a stake in the firm have been on for years.  Last month, the allegation started trending again with some of the viral posts generating millions of reactions. In May, a Twitter user, Ade of Akure, with the handle, @CEO_Billion, in a tweet that had over 2,000 retweets and over 5,000, claimed: “Atiku purchase NEPA and turn it to PHCN. Don’t forget he his CEO of MIKANO Generator. How do you expect this country to move when d person giving u headache is still selling Paracetamol? His business must grow so No way our electricity will be good (sic).” The firm’s Managing Director, Firas Mamouk, in statement, insisted that the PDP presidential candidate had no link with the company, urging the public to disregard media posts supporting such claim. Atiku had earlier responded to the allegation, saying: “If I was a shareholder in a generator company, would I spend 30MW of generation capacity outside,” adding that he generates 30MW of electricity via generating set. A Twitter user @izz_korede had earlier said:
“After I heard that Atiku is the owner of Mikano, it dawned on me that if he becomes President, the whole Nigeria would be in pitch darkness.” Atiku replied: “Young friend, this is not true, but you tweet it all the same. I own bigger companies and they’re known publicly. Why would I deny this one?”
