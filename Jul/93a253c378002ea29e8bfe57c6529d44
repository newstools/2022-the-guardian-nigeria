Two-time Masters champion, Bubba Watson, is reportedly headed to join the breakaway LIV Golf Invitational Series, reports Washington Times. Watson, 43, is the latest well-known golfer to join the Saudi Arabia-funded tour, including Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. The Telegraph was first to report Watson’s move to LIV Golf. The details of the deal haven’t been released, but the other top golfers received north of $100 million. The United Kingdom-based newspaper also reported that Watson is scheduled to make his LIV debut on Labor Day weekend in Boston. Watson, a former world No. 2 player, hasn’t played since late May due to a torn meniscus. He is now the 86th ranked player in the world. Watson has won 12 PGA Tour events, including Masters victories in 2012 and 2014. Watson will reportedly be a captain of one of LIV’s four-player teams. Each LIV tournament also features a team competition with extra cash incentives. The events all have eye-popping $25 million purses. LIV Golf’s third event is this weekend at Donald Trump’s course in Bedminster, New Jersey. The news of Watson‘s move comes a day after LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman announced that the tour would expand to 14 tournaments in 2023 — six more than this year.
