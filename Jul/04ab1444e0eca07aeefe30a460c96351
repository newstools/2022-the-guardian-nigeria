Chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom State and pioneer national publicity secretary of the party, Senator Anietie Okon, has called on the party’s presidential candidate in the 2023 election, Atiku Abubakar, and PDP to quickly placate Nyesom Wike and his camp before the 2023 elections draw near. Supporters of the Rivers State governor are still angry over the outcome of the presidential primary won by Abubakar and had given conditions difficult for Atiku and the PDP to embrace. The situation was said to have worsen when Abubakar picked Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate against Nyesom Wike, who was recommended by the ad hoc committee set up for that purpose. Capitalising on the perceived crisis in the party, some APC governors, comprising Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State; Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo State and Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, paid a visit to Wike, in Port Harcourt. Speaking on the development in the party with The Guardian in Uyo on Saturday, Okon warned that it would amount to taking a killer decision for Atiku and the party to ignore or think of ignoring Wike and his camp. According to Okon, who is also the spokesman for the Akwa Ibom Elders’Forum, Wike is one of the formidable forces in the party, who has stood by it at all times and should not be ignored. He described Wike as a foremost participant of the PDP, who has contributed time and resources to building and sustaining the party. “Wike has been a strong participant of the party. He has done so much for the PDP and has remained a faithful party man. So, thinking of ignoring him is like taking a killer decision, not after a committee set up by the party voted strongly for him. This is very important, every other consideration is immaterial. “Therefore, I will advise Atiku Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate, whom I have congratulated, to do everything possible to handle the situation amicably for the 2023 presidential election,” he said.
