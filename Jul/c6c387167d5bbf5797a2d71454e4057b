Squatters under Lagos State bridges have defied order of the Federal and Lagos government to vacate the facilities. The Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had ordered all occupants and traders under all the bridges in Lagos to vacate within seven days after the March 23, 2022 fire outbreak that destroyed Apongbon Bridge in Lagos Island.  “ I will have to find out what happened about the enforcement. This case is like when the government asks people not to dump refuse in drains but they didn’t listen, and we are seeing the result all over the world so; it’s everyone’s duty, not the government alone.
  
“People pull down streetlights, cart away the poles and also break the concrete to remove the irons. People are being destructive and not taking ownership of government property. Even though they don’t pay taxes, they still do not consider that other people pay the tax for the government to get things done.
   
“Community leaders also need to help society because there are so many things the government cannot enforce; we don’t have the manpower to enforce everything. How many policemen are in Lagos if we want to use the police? Look at how they treat LASMA officials, any mistake they start stoning them as if they committed any offence. Many people don’t want a regulated society at all.”
