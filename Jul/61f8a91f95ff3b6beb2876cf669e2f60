Minister of Interior Affairs and former governor of Osun State, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola did not participate in the governorship election held yesterday, as he was conspicuously absent from his polling unit in Ilesha. Newsmen that went to cover the election in his once bubbling polling unit were disappointed with the low turnout of voters recorded and absence of the minister. Sources close to the Minister said he travelled out of the country since last week. The source said, “Oga has travelled to Germany since last week. We thought he would arrive yesterday but we cannot explain what actually happened.” The source added that Aregbesola would explain himself on return, as he could not go further on volunteering more information about the minister’s absence. Aregbesola had been in a running battle with Governor Gboyega Oyetola over the second term ticket ambition of the governor, which Aregbesola kicked against. In fact, Aregbesola’s political family, The Osun Progressives (TOP), was said to have been working against Oyetola, as they were alleged to have pitched a tent with another candidate.
