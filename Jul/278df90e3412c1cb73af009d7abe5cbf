Amstel Malta Ultra hails ‘brave Super Falcons,’ predicts better outing in Australia Super Falcons’ official malt drink, Amstel Malta Ultra, has commended the ‘gusty’ display by the Nigeria women’s team in their semifinal clash against Atlas Lionesses of Morocco at the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. The brand said though missing the final ticket hurts, Nigerians and global football fans are happy with the never-say-die attitude exhibited by the Super Falcons on Monday night in Rabat. Morocco, who is the host of the biennial continental tournament, needed the lottery of penalty kicks to deny the Super Falcons a 10th WAFCON final appearance and by extension a chance for a record-extending 10th African crown. Despite being reduced to nine players in the 71st minute following the debatable red card to Rasheedat Ajibade, with Halimat Ayinde already sent off earlier, the Super Falcons showed the true Nigerian spirit as they held the hosts for the remainder of the second half and all through the extra time before the ensuing penalty kicks. Ifeoma Onumonu’s lost penalty kick proved costly as the Moroccan Ladies scored all of theirs and effectively sealed their place in their first-ever WAFCON final where they would be battling against South Africa’s Bayana Bayana on Saturday. Amstel Malta Brand Manager, Maire Abia-Bassey, said the Nigerian ladies have shown great promise they would be more than ready for next year’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. She said: “The Super Falcons have shown that they are worthy ambassadors and they deserve to be celebrated even though they did not make it to the final like we all wished and prayed for. “However, beyond that, the team has shown they have great potentials that they can unlock at the World Cup if the momentum is properly built upon” Having missed out on the title, the Super Falcons will try to ensure they get the bronze medals when they take on the Copper Queens of Zambia in Casablanca on Friday.
