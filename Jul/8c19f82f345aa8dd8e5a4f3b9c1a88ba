Succour is on the way for commuters in Ogun and Lagos states, as the two state governments have signed a Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) on the 31-killometre redline passengers rail service from Oyingbo, Lagos State to Agbado in Ogun State. Operations on the rail line are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2023.
 
Secretary to the Ogun State Government (SSG), Tokunbo Talabi, noted the project is a significant achievement in the series of developments engendered by the Lagos/Ogun Joint Commission.
   
He added that the development was an achievement from the robust understanding and synergy between the governors of Lagos and Ogun states in taking advantage of their proximity to better their economies and the lives of their citizens.
  
Talabi noted that significant achievements had been made by the two states through the Joint Commission in the areas of waterways and security, saying, “this is yet another testament of more initiatives to be undertaken by the joint commission”.
