Burna Boy made this revelation in an interview on Shopping For Sneakers. Speaking in the interview, he revealed that while Toni Braxon receives 60% of the streaming royalties off his single ‘Last Last’, she’s only getting a small fraction of the song’s earnings as opposed to the total revenue the single generated. ‘Last Last’ is the seventh song off Burna Boy’s latest album “, Love, Damini.” Burna Boy’s most personal body of work yet, ‘Love, Damini ‘boasts of two hit singles — “Kilometre” and “Last Last,” a banger which samples Toni Braxton’s classic, “He Wasn’t Man Enough,” and has reached nearly 2 billion streams worldwide to date and gained virality on TikTok — all leading up to this project where Burna pulled out all the stops in this 19-tracked album that speaks on the different sides to him as an artist. For his sixth studio album, Burna taps a wide array of big-name talents made up of sensational hit-making artists who join him on this personal project. They include Dancehall icon, Popcaan, who appears on the eleventh track, “T.A.S.,” Blxst and Kehlani are featured on the twelfth track, “Solid”, while Ed Sheeran on the album’s thirteenth track, “For My Hand.” J. Balvin hops on “Rollercoaster,” theres also “Cloak & Dagger”, which features British rapper J. Hus, who collaborated with Burna previously on his own song, “Play Play”, “How Bad Could It Be” feat. Khalid and a stupendous list of other incredible artists. The iconic and legendary south African powerhouse, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, powerfully opens and closes out the album, which is home to other tracks like ‘Whiskey’, ‘Different size’, ‘Dirty Secrets’, ‘Wild dreams’, ‘Common Person’ and ‘Vanilla’.
