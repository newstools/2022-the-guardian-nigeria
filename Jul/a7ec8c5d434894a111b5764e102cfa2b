Hurdle. 33. Inches. That’s the name the 100m hurdles World Champion uses to identify herself on Instagram (@ihurdle_33.0inches). What a name. And she owns it. In World Record-breaking form. While some of her opponents tripped over hurdles and ruined their races, Tobi kept it together consistently, right up to her gold medal victory, bagging her World Record in the Semis. Oluwatobi Amusan THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE 100m HIGH HURDLES WOMEN’S RACE The hurdler has to master ten hurdles at 33 inches (83.8cm). After approaching the first hurdle – which is 13m from the starting block – they must take 3 strides between every hurdle, each being spaced out at 8.5m before getting into the home straight, 10.5m from the finish line. TOBI’S COMMITMENT Tobi has been described as training extremely hard by people who know her. I can only imagine the drills she goes through, as well as the isolation, which, compared to other types of sprinters in training, is more common for hurdlers. This race has been described as “the most difficult and the most technically challenging form of running” and we are proud to see a Nigerian owning her race – the full 33 inches of every hurdle with a combination of grace, speed, endurance, power and flexibility. I first really started to notice Amazon Amusan as I like to call her after she came 4th at The 2020 Olympics (held in Tokyo in 2021). Today, just one year later, she has become one of the greatest masters of this race of all time across both genders.
