PGA of Nigeria Director of Tournaments, Johnbull Dangofa, has disclosed that more than 3,000 Nigerians make their living from golf. He also said that golf has become the fastest growing sport in the country, saying that more people, including military and paramilitary institutions, are coming into the game. Speaking during a one-day Pro-Am golf tournament organised by the Nigerian Army to celebrate the 2022 Army Day at the Arsenal Golf Club in the military base at Obinze, Owerri, Imo State, Dangofa urged other institutions to emulate the military to grow the game. He said: “Over 3000 Nigerians are making a living from golf today and it’s helping to curb youths’ restiveness; this means the game should be taken seriously by all to grow it properly – the government through the ministry of sport to be specific.” He commended “the Nigerian Army through the Chief of Staff for promoting golf always and for allowing civilians to participate in a game with them.” According to Dangofa, “the Nigerian Army over time have been developing and promoting the game; there are golf courses in most military installations and they sponsor tournaments that even professionals have been benefiting from I salute the Nigerian Army.” Dangofa, who is the Resident Professional and manager of Henry Seriaki Dickson Golf and Country Club (HSDGCC), also commended the army for their efforts in tackling insecurity in the South East and other parts of the country.
