The news of the couple’s pregnancy was first broken by news outlet TMZ which first shared photos of Aiko wearing a maxi gray dress, spotting a baby bump with beau Big Sean right by her side. The baby would be Big Sean’s first and Aiko’s second child. Aiko is mom to 13-year-old daughter Namiko Love Browner from a previous relationship. A rep for Aiko told Page Six, “The couple are overjoyed and look forward to this next chapter.” The baby’s announcement comes two years after Big Sean released his single “Deep Reverence,” and one of the song’s lyrics referenced a miscarriage. While he did not specifically mention Aiko in the lyrics, many fans interpreted it to be about them. “Should be a billionaire based on the time off I’m not taking,” he raps on the track. “Probably why the s–t around me get crazy and we lost the baby.” The singers started dating in 2016 and took a break in 2019. At the time, Aiko addressed their split in an Instagram comment, noting that there was no bad blood. Responding to a fan who suggested that she’d trash the rapper on her next album, she wrote, “Me and Sean are good.” s “I’ve got tons of love for him. my next album is all freestyles where I touch on many subjects and relationships… past, present and future.” She continued, “I know you all love the drama and would like to think everything I do or say is about him, but I’ve been through plenty of other things and situations that I pull inspiration from when I sit down to create a song. Have a good day.” The couple got back together in 2020, and their relationship continues to wax strong.
