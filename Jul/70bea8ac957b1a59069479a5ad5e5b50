And while this process is vital for clear, flawless skin, too much of everything can be a problem sometimes. So on those days, you wonder if your skin needs some time off, it might be time for a skin fast. What is Skin Fasting? Think of the times you opt for a fast; whether it is to lose some weight or make changes to your diet, skin fast has exactly the same effect. Skin fasting can be likened to a detox, taking a much-needed break from your usual skincare routine and products to allow your skin to recuperate. Skin fasting allows your skin to return to its natural functions without depending on skincare products. Just like food fasts, skin fasting varies from person to person, and there are different levels to what to eliminate and how long the fast should last. The theory behind this is to allow your skin to rebuild its protective stratum corneum layer, improving its health and resilience. Through skin fasting, you can also figure out what products are responsible for irritation, breakouts, and other problems your skin might be facing. So sometimes, skin fasting could be phasing out each product one at a time until you determine what works for your skin. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1803094 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay-797x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Aloe-vera.-Photo-Pixabay.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> How To Do A Skin Fast Skin fasting depends based on an individual’s skin. For some people, eliminating products one by one is the way to go, while for others, they can take them out all at once for a complete break. For a complete skin fast, you’ll have to stop using all of your skincare products, so that’s goodbye to your cleansers, toners, serums, moisturisers, and hydrators. Instead, your skin’s natural sebum oil does the work of balancing and protecting it. Depending on your skin type, this fast can last between a few days to weeks. As a tip, try retaining basic products like cleansers, moisturisers, and sunscreen. This is because taking out everything may harm your skin. Who Needs A Skin Fast? Skin fasting is often recommended for those with dry, sensitive skin as it removes the trouble of active ingredients, which may trigger inflammation. So, if your skincare routine might be causing you some trouble, consider skin fasting, eliminating one product after another until you find the culprit. Who Doesn’t Need A Skin Fast? Anyone with skin disorders like eczema, uncontrolled acne, rosacea, melasma, or other skin disorders that do require topical products to help doesn’t need a skin fast. And if you’re thinking of doing one, be sure to speak to your dermatologist first. Also, if your skincare routine seems to be working for you, it’s a great idea to leave things as they are. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1803100 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-897x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-1536x1024.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock-600x400.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sunblock.-Photo-Picstock.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> In Conclusion Skin fasting is not one-size-fits-all, and listening to your skin is the right way to go when considering a skin fast. Instead of doing a complete fast, try taking out products one at a time as an option. Skin fasts detoxify your skin and can be really helpful for a fresh start. So if your skin feels like it needs a reboot or your skincare products don’t seem to be doing anything, you can try a skin fast. And while you take out everything else from your skincare routine, remember to keep your skin always protected with sunscreen; remember SPF keeps ageing away and your skin in prime condition always.
