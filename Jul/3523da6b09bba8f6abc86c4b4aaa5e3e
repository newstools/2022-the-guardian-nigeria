The governorship candidate of Action Peoples Party (APP), Adeolu Adebayo yesterday accused the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of hijacking his polling agents in the governorship election. He called on security agents across the state to disallow all the party agents access at the polling units. Adebayo alleged that his party’s agents across the state were compromised and hijacked by the PDP. The guber candidate said: “It has been discovered that all my party agents across Osun state were strangers. I don’t know them and they are never members of the Action Peoples Party (APP). “This was noticed on the passport photograph on my party’s state agent card. I started seeing my party agents’ tags with strange people. Further investigation revealed that members of the PDP are the ones behind the evil act.” As a result, Adebayo called on the Commissioner of Police to arrest anyone carrying APP party agent tags at the polling units across Osun State.
