Ulama Forum in Nigeria, an umbrella body of Islamic scholars and leaders of Islamic organisations has petitioned the Secretary, United States Department of State, Mr. Antony Blinken demanding outright discountenance of the position of five American Senators on the crisis in the country.  “We urge the US government to lead the international community and all friends of Nigeria in assisting in all possible ways to strengthen the Government and people of Nigeria to effectively overcome the security challenges facing the country.
  
“ Uninformed positions, which promote hatred and religious conflict as championed by the five distinguished senators, would only complicate matters; deepen and prolong the crisis; cause greater harm and avoidable suffering, and render solution more intractable, a situation that true Christians would least wish or desire to any people at all”.  
     
Copied in the petition were President Muhammadu Buhari, Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, American Embassy, British High Commission, and the European Union among others.
