They are comedienne Princess, the 14-year-old minor, Olabisi Ajayi-Kayode, a child expert; Aniekan Makanjuola, a medical doctor; Wahab Kareem, the investigating police officer; and Abigail Omane, a policewoman. The judge at Ikeja special offences court Oluwatoyin Taiwo convicted Baba Ijesha of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, and attempted sexual assault in a two-hour judgment. Moments after the ruling, Princess published a video of her singing along to a song of thanksgiving.   A post shared by princessdamilola (@princesscomedian)  Baba Ijesha faced a six-count charge of indecent treatment of a child, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault by penetration. The charges were proffered against him by the Lagos state directorate of public prosecutions (DPP). The offences contravene Section 135, 137, 261, 202, 262 and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015, which stipulates life imprisonment for offenders.
