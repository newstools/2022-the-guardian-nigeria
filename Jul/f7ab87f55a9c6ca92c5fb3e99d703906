• With Poor Living Conditions, ‘Voters Revolution’ Is Imminent  — Yoruba Ronu
• President’s Failure On Campaign Promises Not Enough To Write-off Tinubu — Afenifere Group
• Despite Challenges, APC Remains Preferred Party — Spokesperson As the 2023 general elections draw near, there are indications that the fortunes of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may be adversely affected by the high rate of inflation and the party’s inability to live up to its campaign promises to Nigerians in 2015. The party is believed to have vanquished the goodwill that brought it to power and only lived on what many consider as ‘buying time’.
 
APC’s contract with Nigerians when it rode to power over seven years ago primarily revolved around ridding the country of corrupt practices, revamping the economy and tackling insecurity.
 
With less than nine months to the end of President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term in office, divergent opinions across the country suggest that the well-being of the citizenry has not improved compared to what it was when the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held sway between 1999 and 2015. To be sure, in recent times, widespread insecurity, hyper-inflation, the rising cost of living, increasing national debt stock and dwindling revenue, among others, have diminished the standard of living of Nigerians.
 
Instructively, presidential candidates of other parties such as Peter Obi (Labour Party); Dumebi Kachikwu (African Democratic Congress); Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso (New Nigeria Peoples Party); and Alhaji Atiku Abubakar (PDP) are feasting on the precarious socio-political and economic situation to demarket the ruling APC and its candidate. More importantly, however, close observers of developments in national politics, say that the combination of public discontent with the APC-led government owing to its performance since taking the reins and the increasing difficulty of the average Nigerian to eke out a living and lead a good life may cause the party to lose the presidential election. Referenced pointedly was the defeat of its candidate and incumbent governor of Osun State, Alhaji Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola by the PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke, in the last weekend’s governorship election in the state. Some states in the north, which hitherto used to be strongholds of the APC, were also identified as possible areas where the party might lose. Particularly, Kwankwaso’s resurgence in Kano and neighbouring states of Jigawa, Katsina, Kaduna and Bauchi states is now a source of grave concern for the party. The spiraling inflationary trend, the free fall in the value of the naira to the dollar, the rise in the price of fuel due to failure by the government to fix the refineries, and the prospects of near zero earnings by the federating states from oil proceeds due to the debt profile of the government and sustenance of the subsidy regime have further exacerbated the anger among the electorate. However, in a reaction, the spokesperson of the APC, Mr Felix Morka dismissed aspersions cast on the performance of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, saying it has lived up to its campaign promises. He assured that the party is well positioned to defeat opposition political parties in spite of the challenges Nigerians are grappling with presently. Frowning at members of the opposition who are making a mince meat of the APC over the challenges of security and the downturn in the economy, he blamed the ongoing war in Ukraine for the reverses suffered by the APC-led administration in recent times. Said he: “There is nothing going on that takes away the APC prospects. The party and the government is working hard to address all of the concerns. It is not a proper situation that we have right now and it is not a proper situation anywhere at all. Governance and leading are challenges in themselves. Government is about solving problems. The more we solve problems, the more problems arise because we live in a modern society where challenges prompt up. In my own view, the government is really working very hard to address these challenges. “All of the global economic systems forecast Nigeria to be on a good start. The economy is growing at over 3 per cent. Just a couple of days ago, the World Bank released data showing that the gross national income has actually grown over the last couple of years. “But it doesn’t mean the economy is as robust as it should be. It doesn’t also mean that the government is not working because if it is not working all of those indicators would be negative, and they are not negative right now,” Morka said. Also, the Convener of the APC Rebirth Group, Mr Aliyu Audu, who acknowledged that Kwankwaso constitutes a threat to the fortunes of the party, called on its leadership to reconcile aggrieved members ahead of the 2023 poll.
 
Raising concern over the downturn in the economy, he is, however, sure that the APC-led administration has the wherewithal to address the multifaceted challenges besetting the country.  WEIGHING in on the party’s electoral fortunes in the 2023 elections, some Southwest stakeholders also bemoaned how the APC presidential candidate, Tinubu, is going about his preparations for the election vis-à-vis the reactions of Yoruba leaders and elders to his campaign.
