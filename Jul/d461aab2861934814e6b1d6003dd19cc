The Theatre Commander, Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), Maj-Gen. Christopher Musa, has said two more girls kidnapped on April 14, 2014 from Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, Borno State, have been rescued. Boko Haram terrorists had abducted 276 of the schoolgirls as they sat for their national examinations. Confirming the development in Maiduguri, Musa said the girls are Hanatu Musa and Kauna Luka.  According to him, they were found by troops of 21 Armoured Brigade in Bama Council of Borno State on July 26, 2022. “These girls were rescued after spending about eight years in the captivity of Boko Haram insurgents,” he said.	He explained that the girls escaped from Gazuwa camp, an acclaimed headquarters of the Boko Haram faction controlling Gabchari, Mantari and Mallum communities, nine kilometres from Bama. “The girls’ voluntary escape was as a result of the massive and sustained offensive by the troops of Operation Hadin Kai,” he said, adding that this resulted in hunger and displacement in terrorists’ hideouts.
