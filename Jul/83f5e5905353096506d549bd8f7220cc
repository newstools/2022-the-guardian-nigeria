For the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the 2023 general elections are crucial, because they would be the last to be overseen by the commission on his watch. To Nigerians, the election would determine the future of democracy in the country.  “But, that is wrong, because Oye is not qualified to sign nomination forms, that is what the judgment means. If they continue this way, the danger that APGA will not have a candidate for the election is clear, but the bigger danger is that the constitution is also clear that if a party is excluded, which is what denying Edozie Njoku recognition will amount to because Oye is not the party. If a party is excluded in an election that election will be nullified. So, the entire election coming up is under jeopardy, because of the compromising attitude of INEC officials.” 
      
Could it be that INEC is worried about what could become of the nomination processes that have progressed according to its schedule of activities or merely playing the ostrich so that time would play on the APGA matter? The earlier the commission takes a stand on the matter, the better for all concerned and the public goodwill it needs to prosecute the historic 2023 poll.
