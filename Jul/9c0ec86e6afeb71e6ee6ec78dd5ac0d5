A new Africa match attendance record has been set at the semi-finals of the ongoing 2022 Women African Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Morocco. A total of 45, 562 spectators witnessed the host Atlas Lionesses of Morocco pip holders Super Falcons of Nigeria to qualify for their first WAFCON finals appearance. The game at the Stade Mohamed V, Casablanca on Monday, wasn’t short of drama as nine-time champions Nigeria played most parts of the game with nine players. Halimatu Ayinde was sent off in the 48th minute as the Falcons opened the scoring in the 14th minute, but an equaliser from Morocco followed four minutes after. Rasheedat Ajibade was also sent to the stands in the 70th minute, leaving Nigeria with nine players who had to stay solid in defence to finish regulation and extra time on the same scoreline. The hosts, however, won 5-4 on penalties to set up a final clash against South Africa on Saturday. The Falcons’ loss, however, did not stop Nigeria from joining Morocco, South Africa and Zambia in qualifying for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup to be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.
