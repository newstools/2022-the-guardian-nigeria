In a medium nonstick pan over low heat, melt butter.
30 seconds later, add the minced onions.
Mix with some minced ginger and garlic.
Add chopped mushrooms, green and red peppers, and tomatoes. Cook this for seven minutes, occasionally stirring.
Add the peas, turmeric, and coriander. Take a three-minute break.
Sprinkle in salt, water, curry, and crushed almonds. Give the food 15 minutes to cook.
Turn the heat off and let it cool. Method 2
It is thought that some flavour from the bird’s cooking process made its way into the chicken stock.
Everything that needs to be cleaned should be cleaned.
Put the chicken stock in the refrigerator for a while to allow the chicken oil to cake on top.
Slice the onions, garlic, and mushrooms thinly.
Heat up the caked-on chicken grease in a frying pan after scraping it off.
When it’s hot, add the minced garlic, onions, and mushrooms; cook until the mushrooms are light brown.
Black pepper and chicken stock should then be added.
Pour the boiling mixture into your blender, then process until smooth.
Sit tight for the mushroom to rest before blending it if your blender’s jar is plastic, and then reheat the soup afterward.
When it’s smooth, add boiling water while the blender is running to get the consistency you prefer for soups of this nature. Enjoy!
