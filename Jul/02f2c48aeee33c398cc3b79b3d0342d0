North East Development Commission (NEDC) is set to build a waste recycling plants in the region to engage the youths and discourage them from restiveness. The Head of Environmental and Natural Resources, NEDC, Adamu Lawan, disclosed this yesterday in Gombe State, at the opening of a week-long training of 100 scavengers and 50 trainers on efficient waste management practices and recycling. According to him, the move is to encourage the youths in waste gathering, noting that the compensation for scavengers is to further discourage youths from social vices. At the official launch of the training in Bauchi, the Director-General of the Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Ibrahim Kabir, said the scavengers would collect wastes for recycling after the training. Kabir said the move was to boost the economy of the state, and its beneficiaries and for a cleaner environment. He said: “Bauchi State has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding of $70 million with a United Kingdom (UK) firm, Power.uk, on power generation. They are willing to invest here and have asked us for 21 acres of land. We have given that. They requested registration in Nigeria and we are transferring that of our Yankari Power Company to them. They also asked for a waste monopoly. This means they are the only ones to operate in the state. “The only thing remaining now is the issue of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This has to do with the Federal Ministry of Environment; it is not within our jurisdiction. We are waiting for them to respond to our request,” he said. NEDC Lead Consultant, Prof. Ahmed Sabo, said the commission has identified the scavengers and grouped them under trainers to sort waste. “There are trainers, who are graduates here. They are environmentalists, who know the best way to turn waste into wealth,” he said.
