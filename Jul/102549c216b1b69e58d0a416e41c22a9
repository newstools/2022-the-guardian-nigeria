Speaking with GQ Hype, Quavo addressed the clip of the then-couple physically fighting in an apartment elevator, expressing his disappointment at the viewer’s perception of him after it was released. He said, “If I can ever speak on it, I never once in a million years want to do any harm to any woman, period.” “I don’t like what people think… When they saw the elevator thing they thought it was abusive, something crazy.” Back in March 2021, TMZ shared the minute-and-a-half-long video which had allegedly occurred in Saweetie’s apartment building. In the video, Saweetie struck Quavo in the face and threw a suitcase out of an elevator. Quavo then dragged the “Icy” rapper into the elevator and fell on top of her. Saweetie seemingly laid on the floor before struggling to pick herself up and limp out of the elevator while Quavo watched. At the time, she addressed the incident speaking to People saying: “This unfortunate incident happened a year ago, while we have reconciled since then and moved past this particular disagreement, there were simply too many other hurdles to overcome in our relationship and we have both since moved on.” “I kindly ask that everyone respect my privacy during this time.” However, Quavo responded with a statement claiming he never assaulted her. He said, “We had an unfortunate situation almost a year ago that we both learned and moved on from,” he said. “I haven’t physically abused Saweetie and have real gratitude for what we did share overall.” A week before the video’s release, Saweetie had announced their breakup via a tweet. She said, “I’m single. I’ve endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character,” Saweetie tweeted. “Presents don’t band aid scars and the love isn’t real when the intimacy is given to other women.” “I emotionally checked out a long time ago and have walked away with a deep sense of peace and freedom. Excited for this new chapter of elevation .” Addressing her post, Quavo tweeted, “You are not the woman I thought you were.” “I know you want to make this into a show so I’ll play my part just this one time,” he wrote. “I don’t normally put my business out there, especially my personal life. I feel the need to address this so there are no false narratives.” “I had love for you and disappointed you did all that. You are not the woman I thought you were. I wish you nothing but the best,” Quavo added.
