The Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, has urged the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to upgrade its information technology (IT) infrastructure to enable a smooth interface with the NICIS II platform of the service. The customs boss stated this when the Director-General of SON, Farouk Salim, along with his management team, visited the NCS headquarters in Abuja. The CGC agreed that synergy between critical government agencies at the ports will greatly enhance efficiency and would do much good in protecting the nation as well as its citizens. On his part, the SON Director-General emphasised the strategic role played by the customs in the fight against the importation of substandard products. He also acknowledged the historical support given to his organisation while requesting more strategic engagement in the light of their recent return to the ports. The DG promised to do all in his power to make this a reality, while also requesting for Customs officers to be trained in ISO certifications. The meeting corroborated the readiness and willingness of the Nigerian Customs Service to discharge its statutory responsibilities of protecting the national economy through trade facilitation, revenue generation and anti-smuggling activities while providing the needed support in safeguarding the nation from the importation of substandard goods through collaboration with SON as the designated authority.
