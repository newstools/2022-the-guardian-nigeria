Produced by burgeoning hitmaker Yung Willis (Kizz Daniel, BNXN, Falz), ‘Full Current (That’s My Baby)’ is a captivating global music fusion track, weaving together afrorap and afrobeats, which sees Phyno waxing lyrical in both English and his native Igbo languages about treating his woman like the Queen she is. The track is underpinned by an infectious musical backdrop built around lush amapiano instrumentation and trademark afrobeats sensibilities, and driven by Phyno’s signature flow and razor-sharp lyricism, as well as Tekno’s masterful vocal delivery and addictive melodies. Speaking about the inspiration behind ‘Full Current’, Phyno says, “the song was inspired by the need for us to treat women as the Queens that they are, and for us to hold our women in the highest esteem. The track is about the extent I will go to treat my woman like a Queen and also how much I’ll spoil her with the best things in life. If you’re going to go for a lady, go all in with ‘full current’ as the song title suggests. Tekno and I were in the studio with Willis, when he played this beat, and in less than 10 minutes, Tekno had a hook for it – we recorded the track that night”. Revered as one of the pioneers of indigenous music in Africa, who inspired countless artists across the continent to embrace recording in their native language, Phyno celebrates a decade at the top of Nigerian music this year, marking ten years since his classic breakthrough single ‘Ghost Mode’. The award-winning artist and producer now has four acclaimed albums under his belt, accolades from MTV Africa Music Awards and The Headies, and sold-out tours across the world, while holding the record for headlining the biggest-selling concert series in Nigeria, PhynoFest. ‘Full Current (That’s My Baby’) is the first official single of the year from Phyno, following last year’s critically acclaimed and much lauded ‘Something To Live For’ album
