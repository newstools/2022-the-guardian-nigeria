The widely held notion that Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital is the most secured location in the country has been gravely punctured. In recent times, the attack on the nation’s medium Correctional Centre, Kuje, was one of such alarming instances when rag-tag terrorists took the wind off the sails of Nigeria’s security agencies.  However, after years in office, the President was harassed about his personal health and second-guessed over military tactics adopted in the fight against insurgency and secessionist agitations in the country.  Ambush
LAST Monday’s ambush on Guards Brigade came at the lowest ebb of the mounting insecurity in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which is also the seat of Nigeria’s Federal Government.
   
Military sources explained that the Guards Brigade is responsible for securing Abuja, particularly the Presidential Villa, where President Buhari sleeps and works.
   
While on their routine patrol, the elite squad ran into an ambush at the Bwari-Kubwa precincts, where they received a battery of gunshots, leaving some troops dead and others wounded. In a signal, the military authorities declared that the Guards Brigade was “ambushed by suspected terrorists.
   
“Three soldiers were injured during the attack; the soldiers have been evacuated for medical attention. Details on the extent of their injuries are still under confirmation. The ambush attack happening within the general area of Bwari shows that the terrorists are actually within the location and possibly preparing to carry out their plans to attack the Law School in Bwari, as earlier reported.”
