Civil Society Organization (CSO), Conference of Civil Society for Peace, Security and National Development yesterday charged the authorities of the tertiary education trust fund (TETfund) to live up to its statutory duties on the provision of scholarship and infrastructure in tertiary institutions in the country. The groups in a statement by Adamu Muhammad and Hon. Mike Msuan argued that the call was aimed at repositioning the educational sector of the country. The group described as mischievous, attempts by an online publication to tarnish the image and personality of the Executive Secretary of TETFund, Architect Sunny Echono. The group expressed displeasure over the baseless and unwarranted attacks on the person and office of the TETFund boss, insisting that it is nothing but an empty attempt aimed at blackmail and character assassination. The CSO insists that the allegations against Arc. Sunny are not only baseless but petty blackmail, considering that he has been an outstanding civil servant for many years without even a query, rising to the position of Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education and now the Executive Secretary of TETFund. “Arc. Echono exudes traits of a committed public servant. Honest and professional in his dealings in all responsibilities put under his watch. Accusing him of executing projects by proxy without being bold to mention any of the said companies he uses to carry out those projects is just a desperate attempt to throw mud on the reputation of the accomplished public officer by cooking up unsubstantiated claims. “This media war aimed at damaging the pedigree of the Executive Secretary and by extension, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari will not work”, the statement added.
