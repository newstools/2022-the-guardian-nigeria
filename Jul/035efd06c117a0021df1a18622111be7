Israel Adesanya successfully defended his middleweight title at UFC 276, while featherweight Alexander Volkanovski came out on top with a one-sided points victory over rival Max Holloway, reports Skysports. Adesanya used his height and reach in expert fashion against Jared Cannonier, employing a ramrod jab and vicious leg kicks to control the distance at the T-Mobile Arena, Las Vegas. The Nigerian claimed a unanimous points win with scores of 49-46, 49-46 and 50-45 as he retained his title for a fifth time – and called out Alex Pereira in the octagon afterwards. Brazil’s Pereira, who holds two kickboxing wins over Adesanya in 2016 and 2017, knocked out Sean Strickland on the undercard. “We know who’s next,” said Adesanya. “Next time I put you on skates, you’re going to get frozen like Elsa.”
