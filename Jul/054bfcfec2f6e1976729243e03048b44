Barely seven weeks after suspected terrorists killed 41 worshippers in Owo, the headquarters of Owo Local Council of Ondo State, a gang of bandits have re-launched an attack on the community.
 
The Guardian learnt that the gunmen stormed Craneburg Construction Company on Wednesday, evening at about 9:30p.m., attacking the night guards and destroying some of the company’s properties.
  
The victims are: Rifum Lawrence, 50 and Abraham Opara, 45 years, both are night guards in the company located at Folahanmi Junction, Owo, sustaining injuries from the attack.  Odunlami disclosed that an Anti Bomb Squad confirmed that an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) was used to bust a tractor tyre at the scene of the crime.
 
“The Command is using this medium to warn those who do not know the real situation of things not to cause unnecessary panic by peddling unconfirmed stories relating to the incident,” she said.
