Oyo State Police Command has arrested a woman identified as Itunu Adepoju who absconded with a three-day-old baby, in Ibadan, the state capital. Adepoju, 23, who lives in Badore area of Ajah, Lagos State, tricked 36-year-old Monsurat Lateef, the mother of the baby, by pretending to be in dire need of accommodation. According to the Command’s spokesperson, Superintendent of Police (SP) Adewale Osifeso, Lateef delivered a female child on Saturday, July 16, 2022, at Yahora Faith Mission, Itamerin, Ogbere, Ibadan and on Tuesday, July 19, 2022 proceeded to Abaemu General Hospital, Ona-Ora, for immunisation for her daughter from where she met the suspect who approached her as a friendly patient who also sought medical intervention. “Unknow to Lateef, the suspect had just suffered a stillbirth and had been referred to the same health facility for scan. “They started chatting and the suspect indicated interest in moving down to Ibadan from Lagos and was in dire need of accommodation. “Lateef, driven by empathy decided to oblige her by assisting her with the house search. “The complainant decided to invite her to spend the night because it was already late. “In what seemed a premeditated action around 1300HRS, the suspect, who had now totally gained the confidence and trust of her host, pleaded to use a nearby point of sales terminal with the three-day-old baby carefully tucked on her back to collect the money sent by her fiance for the purpose of paying the rent. “The complainant obliged the suspect before she later realised she had been tricked and that the suspect had absconded with her child.” Osifeso noted that investigation is ongoing, adding that the suspect would be charged to court upon completion of the investigation. He enjoined residents of the state to remain cooperative and unrelenting with providing timely and credible information, capable of nipping crime in the bud at all times.
