The first group of 12 housemates who presently reside in the Level Two home were presented to the show on Day One of the premiere ceremony. Big Brother Naija’s “Level Up” season marked the first time in the program’s history that the producers added a novel twist by having the housemates reside in two distinct areas known as the “Level One and Level Two home.” This turn of events should keep viewers and show devotees riveted to their TVs. However, it is unclear if the residents of the two houses will be pitted against one another. During the second premiere of the “Level Up” edition, the show’s host, Ebuka Obi Uchendu, unveiled a second house and gave viewers a tour of the other side of the house on Saturday night. Fast-rising artists Fave and Blaqbonez performed during the live event on Sunday, thrilling the audience. Eloswag claims to be a dancer and to embody entertainment.
