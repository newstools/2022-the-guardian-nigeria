The family of Kitan are still in shock over the killing of their two sons and cousins by bandits in Jenuwa Gida Nyicwu village in Takum Local Council of Taraba State.  Reacting, the chairman of the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev. Dr. Isaiah Magaji Jirapye, said: “The attacks, which have taken place unabatedly, have resulted in the death of many innocent people while several commuters also fall victims.
 
“CAN cannot fold its arm and watch innocent people killed. If the government cannot guarantee the security of the people then the people should be allowed to protect themselves.”
