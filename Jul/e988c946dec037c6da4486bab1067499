A Federal High Court in Abuja has expressed displeasure over the undue interference of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) in the $3.1B suit instituted against it and nine others by aggrieved Companies on the disputed e-Customs Project.  The court also issued an order of interim injunction against the Federal Government or its agents, acting through the Federal Executive Council, from retrospectively ratifying the decisions to concession the Custom Modernisation Project also known as the e-custom project to Trade Modernisation Project Limited, Huawei Technologies Company Limited and African Finance Corporation.
 
The restraining order issued by Justice Ekwo was to last till the hearing and the determination of the suit brought against the defendants by Messrs E-Customs HC Project Limited and Bionica Technologies (West Africa) Limited.
 
Counsel to the two aggrieved companies, Mr Anone Usman had argued an ex-parte application in which he prayed the Court for interim orders against the defendants to protect the interest of his clients.
 
Justice Ekwo, while ruling on the ex-parte application on June 17 had granted the prayers of the plaintiffs having placed sufficient evidence of interest in the concession project.
