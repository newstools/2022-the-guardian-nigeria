The procedure hasn’t been easy for the Queen of Pop, and it appears that she’s having difficulty getting it just perfect. According to reports, Madonna is courting Julia Garner to portray the singer in her self-written and directed musical biography. “I have a very long script that is really hard for me to make shorter,” Madonna told Variety recently. “I’ve been whittling away at it, but it’s like hacking off my limbs.” The singer continued, “I’ve had an extraordinary life, I must make an extraordinary film. It was also a preemptive strike because a lot of people were trying to make movies about me. Mostly misogynistic men. So I put my foot in the door and said, ‘No one’s going to tell my story, but me!'” The filming procedure, she earlier told the press, has been “pretty crazy so far.” She stated that she is simply in the writing process, choosing which stories to tell, and how much depth to go into, and which characters to develop. She acknowledged process has been difficult but also quite healing. The film will follow the life of  singer from her early years to her status as the greatest pop star in the world. Also rumored to be in negotiations to portray her lifelong friend Debi Mazar is actress Julia Fox from “Uncut Gems.” Florence Pugh, Alexa Demie, Odessa Young, Bebe Rexha, and Sky Ferreira were more Madonna contenders. A “Madonna boot camp” that featured rigorous dance training sessions with the icon and Madonna’s choreographer that could last up to 11 hours per day was also required of the actresses, as was a “grueling” audition procedure with casting director Carmen Cuba.
