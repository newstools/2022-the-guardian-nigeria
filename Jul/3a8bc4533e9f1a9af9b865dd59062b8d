Okolo said: “It is with great pain that we announce to you the kidnapping of our priest, Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Silas. The event occurred in the early hours of July 4, 2022, before the morning Mass.” At the time of going to press, there was no information of the abductors making any demand.

The newly-wedded lady and the wife of a journalist with Vision FM in the state, Ibrahim Dutsinma, were also kidnapped. The Guardian gathered that the terrorists stormed the community after security agents in a neighbouring village had repelled them. Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), a Katsina council, condemned the abduction and called on security agencies to intensify efforts at rescuing the victims. The Katsina NUJ, in a statement signed by its chairman, also called on reporters to be security-conscious while carrying out their responsibilities. “Katsina State Council of NUJ has received with shock and much concern the news of the abduction of the wife of a journalist working with Vision FM Radio. We learnt that the kidnappers abducted the journalist’s wife together with some other victims at a village in Kurfi Local Council, where she went for a wedding ceremony. “While appreciating the police and other security agencies in Katsina for their efforts in curbing criminality, we urge them to redouble their efforts in this regard,” the statement reads.
