• PSC despatches 30 staff monitors for Osun polls
• Urges policemen to adhere to rules of engagement
• CDD, Farounbi, others warn against vote-buying
• INEC moves sensitive materials to local councils
• APC supporter falls off moving vehicle during rally The Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking the disqualification of Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the governorship election scheduled for tomorrow. In his judgment, Justice Inyang Ekwo, said that the plaintiff, an aspirant in the Osun APC governorship primary, Moshood Adeoti, failed to support his processes with relevant laws, and as such, showed no cause of action in the suit, which makes it a gross abuse of court process. Justice Inyang added that the suit falls outside the scope of Section 87 (9) of the Electoral Act and Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution. The judge also agreed with the APC (first defendant) that the court could not assume jurisdiction on the matter on the grounds that there was no cause of action for filing the suit. MEANWHILE, the Police Service Commission (PSC) has urged police officers sent for election operations to adhere strictly to the rules of engagement during the Osun State governorship election. The PSC has also despatched staff monitors to the 30 local councils of the state to oversee the conduct of police officers during the polls. ALSO, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has moved sensitive materials to local councils in readiness for the election. The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Prof. Abdulganiy Raji, while handing out the materials, said the electoral officers would take the items to their councils where they would be sent to the polling units. IN another development, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has warned that without proper monitoring, the forthcoming governorship election in Osun State could be exposed to massive rigging and unprecedented vote-buying compared to Ekiti State governorship election. A member of the CDD Election Analysis Centre (EAC), Prof. Victor Isumonah, raised this concern, while presenting a pre-election observation report on the election, yesterday, in Abuja. In the same vein, a group of intellectuals, opinion moulders and thought leaders, under the aegis of the National Association of Public Affairs Analysts (NAPAA) and a former Nigerian Ambassador to the Philippines, Dr. Yemi Farounbi, yesterday, urged the electorate in Osun State not to sell their future through vote-buying. SADLY, one of the supporters of the ruling APC, yesterday, fell off a moving pick-up and was crushed by a vehicle during a campaign rally. The victim, whose name could not be identified, sat on one of the vehicles conveying a controversial hip-hop artiste, Habeeb Okikiola, known better as Portable, who was campaigning for Oyetola. The victim was suddenly rushed to an unknown hospital for treatment, but feasibly unperturbed by the development, Okikiola and his team continued their campaign.
