The management of C&I Leasing has explained the temporary suspension of trading on its shares by the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) as one caused by delayed regulatory approvals. According to the firm, its operations are guided by multiple regulators for the different aspects of its services to various industries, which has delayed its filings even though the company’s financial reports are presently up to date. “We are actively engaging with the (NGX) to resolve all outstanding regulatory obligations. Nonetheless, we would submit our 2021 filings as soon as the necessary regulatory approvals have been obtained. “We crave the indulgence, and understanding of the general public, and also wish to reassure our shareholders and other stakeholders including all our esteemed customers, of management’s commitment to good corporate governance and global best practices in all our dealings”, it added in a statement.
