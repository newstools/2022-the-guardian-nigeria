The Edo State government has disclosed plans to host local tournaments for 15 sporting competitions in line with the government’s sports development drive. Edo State Acting Governor, Philip Shaibu, said in Benin City, yesterday, that the government plans to harness the full sporting potential of its youthful population and create jobs through sports. He said over 50,000 job opportunities would be created through the 15 competitions, which, he added, would ensure positive engagement for youths in the state. Shaibu said: “The easiest way to deal with youths’ restiveness and unemployment is to engage the youths in sporting activities.” The acting governor said the Edo league would begin in January 2023 and called for the support of all stakeholders, including private organisations to ensure the realisation of the project. Reassuring support for private organisations and other businesses, Shaibu noted: “Our cardinal focus is to make sure that the private sector drives the economy of the state. We are repositioning the government to create an environment for businesses to thrive. “We are commencing a flagship programme for the 15 sports in January 2023. This will enable us to give our youths a new lease of life and positively engage them so that they would not be available for anti-social activities.”
