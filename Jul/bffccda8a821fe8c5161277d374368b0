Thus, SLF posted an annualized ROA and ROE of 33% and 66% which are good in our opinion,’’ the rating agency said. Other key rating drivers the agency highlighted in the report include short-term and long-term financing surpluses of ₦1.2 billion and ₦935 million respectively as at 31 December 2021 which SFL recorded that resulted in an overall working capital surplus of ₦2.1 billion which the agency considers adequate.
