Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, has appealed for restrain over anti-party activities among members and support the choice of Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as running mate to the party’s presidential flagbearer, Atiku Abubakar. Jibrin advised that party stalwarts should allow Atiku and the national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, to return from their overseas trip and lead a delegation to the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, for a reconciliation meeting. Jibrin, who disclosed this in a statement made available to journalists in Kaduna, yesterday, said as soon as they return, the process of reconciling all aggrieved members will commence, with Atiku Abubakar to head the committe. The BoT chairman listed members of the reconciliation committee to include:
Atiku, Okowa, Ayu, the National Working Committee (NWC), Jibrin, 13 PDP governors, former governors, former ministers and some party elders from the states. The statement noted that “this was in view of great sense of concern on the recent comments of some members and prominent Nigerians on the choice of Okowa as the Vice Presidential candidate by Atiku. “All the comments and submissions are normal in any political set up in Nigeria today with PDP being the strongest and most prominent party that has all potential to form the next central government. We must come back to our senses by giving total support to the party to enable it form government in 2023. “It is therefore necessary that when our presidential candidate and national chairman both return to Nigeria, a very important visit must be undertaken to Governor Wike for the reconciliation.”
