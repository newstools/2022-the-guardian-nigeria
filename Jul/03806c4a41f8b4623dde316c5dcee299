• Path To Collaboration Not Exhausted, Says Omo-Agege
• Senators Peeved By Buhari’s Failure On Security –Adeyemi
• Lawmakers Unserious–Babatope
• Indication Of Buhari’s Failure–Uwazuruike What would the impeachment of a President, who has just 10 months to complete his term, achieve? Have the federal lawmakers exhausted all avenues for a productive synergy with the Presidency before waiving the impeachment flag?  “As it is today, no part of the country is safe. There is no part of the country that you can travel freely any longer. The airlines have become Aircraft of Choice, even though those who live in Kaduna fly to Kano and the choice of flying by air has become rampant, they are due to insecurity.
   
“So, the National Assembly is on track to get Mr President either to sit up or commence impeachment proceedings. I don’t see anything wrong in it. So it is better late than never. Let nobody hinge the ineptitude on the fact that he has a few months to stay. A bad President can do a lot of damage under one month.
    
“So if we are going to set an example that he either performs or is butted out, let us start it now, so that whoever is coming in on May 29 will also know that it is not a tea party. It has nothing to do with religion or section but the totality of Nigeria.”  vv”But, they have reached a point now where everybody is ashamed. The opposition people are taking the bull by the horn now. I can I assure you that the majority of APC members in the national Assembly will support them. They cannot say it now until it comes to voting.”
  
However, an APC Senator, Smart Adeyemi, said it was wrong to associate the impeachment with vendetta, stressing: “My position is not informed by failure to get APC ticket.
     
He disclosed that the decision to give six weeks’ ultimatum to the President to step up his performance on security, emanated from APC Senators and not even from the minority caucus.
