Flourish Africa, the women empowerment movement founded by Apostle Folorunso Alakija, has awarded business grants of up to N2 million to 100 female entrepreneurs out of its N1 billion fund earmarked to empower 2500 female entrepreneurs in five years.  Nwuneli noted that it has become imperative for women to rise above any stumbling block by venturing into uncharted territories to realise their God-given potentials.
   
She added that despite the challenging operating environment, some women have continued to shatter the glass ceilings to become great achievers and CEOs of many corporate organisations in the country.
   
Though these activities indicate progress, she said “that is not enough. Statistics of land ownership shows that only 10 per cent of women in Nigeria own lands and when you do not own land as an entrepreneur, it limits you from owning collateral and investing in long term assets like a factory. So, women need to become owners of assets.”  Vice-Chairman, Channels Media Group, Mrs. Shola Momoh, appreciated Alakija for providing such a unique platform where women could become financially independent and create a prosperous future for themselves.
   
One of the beneficiaries and president of the Flourish Africa Alumnae Association, Mrs. Hamsatu Aliu-Afegba, expressed her appreciation to Flourish Africa for the unique opportunity, noting that the grant would assist immensely in growing her business.
   
She said that beyond the grant, she had acquired skill sets that will remain with her for life, help her grow her business and support other women to succeed in future.
