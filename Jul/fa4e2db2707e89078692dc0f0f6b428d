Barely three months after the Eko Bridge was partially closed to vehicular traffic, connecting Lagos Island through the bridge has become a pain in the neck for many motorists and commuters.  “Out of 24 hours in a day, most Lagos residents spend a couple of that in traffic daily. Some get so frustrated with what is happening and resort to trekking. Those that are in a chauffeur-driven vehicle that attempts to work in traffic using mobile devices become easy targets for traffic robbers. Those who trek get easily worn out before reaching their destinations or offices. It is just a very frustrating experience.”
   
For Peace Maurice, it was bad and painful staying in traffic for three to four hours, just because a section of a bridge was closed to vehicular traffic. She noted that sometimes for like 20 minutes, her bus might not move an inch. “I do not understand why the government will close the bridge, and not ensure free-flowing traffic on the alternative routes. It is annoying to be stuck in traffic to and from work. This drains people mentally and physically, and there is no way that you can function effectively at work and home. The government should do the damaged bridge quickly because it seems to be taking a long time to complete the repair works,” Maurice said.
