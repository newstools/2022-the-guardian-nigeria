Long jumper, Ese Brume, has promised to do her best to end Nigeria’s search for a medal at the Oregon 2022 World Athletics Championships, which ends tomorrow in the United States. Efforts by Nigeria’s male and female sprinters have not yielded much dividends at Oregon. The country’s 4x100m relay for both men and women began their search for medals late yesterday. Brume will start her individual event today, same as sprint hurdler, Tobi Amusan. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday after her training yesterday, Brume said: “I will always give my best and I pray that God gives me the strength to deliver a medal for Nigeria.” Few athletes guarantee medals for their country just like Brume. Since she broke into limelight in 2013, Brume has won a medal at every major championship she attended. She became the first Nigerian to win an Olympics medal in athletics in 13 years after grabbing a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics. On March 22nd this year, Brume won Nigeria’s only medal, a silver, at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, leaping to a new Personal Best of 6.85m. Brume grabbed a bronze medal at the last edition of the World Championships in Doha, Qatar three years ago. If she gets a medal today, Brume will be become the first Nigerian athlete to win medals at two editions of the event.
