• Agric, medical, water, soil institutes paralysed
• Absence of NAFDAC at port spells doom for food, and drug safety
• Port congestion worsens, products approval delayed
 
Nigerians have raised the alarm over the safety of food and drugs as the National Agency for Food, Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) fully joined other research institutes and associated institutions in their eight-month-old strike action.  A visit to NAFDAC’s headquarters in Abuja and the Head Office in Isolo, Lagos, yesterday, showed that the ever-busy complexes were deserted, the workers stayed away and nobody was allowed inside the premises.
   
A NAFDAC worker who preferred anonymity told The Guardian: “I blame the situation on the leadership style of the Director-General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye. She does not carry the workers along. Since she came along, so many things have changed for the worst. She is busy chasing things that do not benefit the staff.”
   
NAFDAC’s Resident Media Consultant, Mr Sayo Akintola, had promised that the management would give an update.
    
The Guardian investigation revealed that the strike action has led to congestion at the ports and delays in the approval of products by the agency.
