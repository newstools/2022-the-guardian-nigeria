It is also an amazing dish for the weekends and at parties. Many beef lovers find themselves warming up to this spicy beef dish. To make this dish, cow meat is the meat of choice. In most homes beef forms the heart of their meals, but here is one of the many ways to make that peppered beef. Use the yellow pepper, green pepper, scotch bonnet, and shombo, commonly known as cayenne pepper. The addition of carrots elevates the flavour and taste of the peppered beef to a new level. The majority of activities held in Nigeria almost always include meat. Due to the amount of cholesterol, it contains, meat should be consumed in moderation. Cow meat can be prepared in a variety of ways and is used to make suya and barbecued meat. Similar to beef kebab, also referred to as stick meat, peppered goat meat (Asun), and peppered cow liver, it is fiery and spicy. Ingredient
250g plain cow meat
¼ large pepper
2 medium shombo
1 scotch bonnet
1 yellow pepper
½ teaspoon powdered turmeric
½ teaspoon curry powder
½ teaspoon rosemary
1 small glove of fresh garlic
1 chop of fresh ginger
2 small carrot
1 medium red onion
½ medium white onion
2 seasoning cubes
Salt to taste
250ml vegetable oil for frying Photo Credit: Sisi Jemimah Method
Reduce the meat’s size and thoroughly wash it in salt water.
Wash the various peppers along with the red and white onion halves, mix coarsely, and set aside. Slice the remaining half of the red onion, then dice the green pepper after washing it. Grate the carrot, as well as the freshest ginger and garlic, using a grater after scraping the back of the carrot with a knife. After washing the meat, add it to a pot along with the onion that has previously been thinly sliced, rosemary spice, curry powder, turmeric powder, freshly grated garlic, seasoning cube, and salt. Work with your hands, cover, and wait 30 minutes for the spices to absorb. Put the seasoned meat in the cooker, turn the heat to low, and simmer it until all the water has been absorbed. In a dry, empty pot, add the vegetable oil and heat it before adding the prepared meat and frying it for 7 to 10 minutes without letting it dry up. Oil is reduced, blended pepper mixture is added, and carrot is grated, stirred, and simmered until dry. The seasoning cube is added, stirred, and salt is tasted before adding. For an additional three to five minutes, simmer covered. The already-fried meat should be added, stirred, and simmered until the meat has absorbed the sauce. Take heat off, then serve with any drink of choice.
