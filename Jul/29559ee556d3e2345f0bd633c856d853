The Management of the Nigerian Communications Commission has appointed Reuben Muoka, as its new Director of Public Affairs (DPA).  He was promoted as Director of the Department before his current redeployment to lead the Public Affairs Department, the arm of the Commission mandated to manage the image and visibility of Nigeria’s telecoms regulator and a leading light of the Nigerian public service.
   
Muoka is expected to bring his rich and versatile experience in both specialized and traditional journalism, public relations, integrated marketing communications (IMC), corporate communication and people management, to bear on the Commission’s vision to expand the frontiers of its public goodwill and the impact of its reputational assets.
