The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has pledged to address the situation of electricity supply in its network, while its customers lament inadequate power supply and estimated billings.  Esenwa appealed to the customers and explained that while some of the complaints raised are peculiar to EKEDC, many were due to general issues affecting electricity supply in the nation. 
   
On the issue of inadequate supply of power, the CFO indicated that the Disco, in recent times, does not get its due allocation of supply from the national grid as a result of low generation of power, and manages the insufficient one it gets from the grid. 
   
He, however, informed the customers about the ongoing efforts to resolve the situation such as the CBN loans for Capex projects to TCN and Discos, which will ensure procurement and rehabilitation of many electricity infrastructures to improve power supply in Nigeria. 
   
As regards metering, Esenwa advised the customers to key into the Meter Asset Provider (MAP) scheme to get prepaid meters. He also announced the commencement of mobile metering within the company’s network and assured customers that the exercise will get to their areas in due time. The CFO concluded by calling for continued support from the customers, especially in the area of curbing energy theft, which contributes to high billings the customers are experiencing. Furthermore, he urged them to duly inform their respective communities about this and engage their local security networks to stop the perpetrators who mostly carry out the heinous act at night.
