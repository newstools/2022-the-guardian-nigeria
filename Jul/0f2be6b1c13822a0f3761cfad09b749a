A Court of Appeal in has dismissed a suit by a governorship aspirant of the People Democracy Party (PDP), Dotun Babayemi, against the governor-elect, Ademola Adeleke. A PDP faction declared Babayemi the winner of the primary election held at the Children and Women Development Center in Osogbo. The primary election that produced Adeleke as PDP candidate was held at Osogbo City Stadium. However, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) recognised Adeleke as the PDP governorship candidate for Osun State. Babayemi filed a lawsuit at the Federal High Court in Oshogbo to be recognized as the PDP’s governorship candidate. But in a ruling by Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel, the court upheld Adeleke as the Osun State PDP’s duly elected governorship candidate.

Dissatisfied with the ruling, Babayemi filed a suit at the court of appeal, Akure, challenging the judgment of the lower court and seeking to be declared as the PDP governorship candidate. On Wednesday, the court of appeal in its judgment dismissed Babayemi’s appeal and recognised Adeleke as PDP candidate for the election.
