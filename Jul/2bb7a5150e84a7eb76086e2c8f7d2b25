Following sustained bargain hunting in Seplat Energy and 15 stocks, the Nigerian equities market reopened in an upbeat yesterday, causing market capitalisation to increase further by N56 billion.. In summary, the All-Share Index (ASI) grew by 104.82 absolute points, representing a rise of 0.20 per cent, to close at 52,319.94 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value gained N56 billion to close at N28.214 trillion. The market positive performance was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks which are; Seplat Energy, Flour Mills of Nigeria, Fidson Healthcare, Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), Wema Bank and United Capital. This week, United Capital Plc expected continued bargain hunting as investors continue to look forward to the first half (H1), 2022 earnings season, cherry-picking stocks with potential for strong earnings performance as well as interim dividend payment. “However, we note that a strong hike in Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) at this week’s MPC meeting could spell bad news for the equities market,” they said.
