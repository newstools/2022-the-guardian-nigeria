A Nigerian tyre recycling company, Freee Recycle Limited, formerly known as Freetown Waste Management Recycle Limited, has urged the Federal Government to partner with recyclers to generate business opportunities and wealth for the people, while ensuring a safe and healthy environment for all. The firm’s Managing Director, Ifedolapo Runsewe, who stated this during the unveiling ceremony of the company’s new corporate identity, lamented the improper disposal of tyres in Nigeria, noting that efforts are being made to engage stakeholders to stem the tide. Runsewe, therefore, urged producers of tyres to increase their efforts at environmental responsibility by ensuring that an end-of-life plan is created for their products. She stated that Nigeria has a long way to go in adopting better waste disposal methods, adding that it is good that the country begins to open up and embrace recycling even though it is still at an infancy stage. She said: “We also knew that the solutions we provide in Nigeria will work elsewhere. Hence, we made a plan to start in Nigeria and then replicate the solutions around the world, starting with other African countries.”
