After the first two editions in Kaduna, the yearly Adewale Isa Memorial National Junior Championship is coming to Lagos for the first time, with contestants from across the country billed to converge on the National Stadium, Surulere, from August 1 to 6. While unveiling the third edition of the competition, yesterday, Yinka Isa-Adigun, said the competition is a continuation of his late father’s legacy of developing grassroots tennis players. Isa-Adigun, who is the eldest daughter of the late national referee, said: “Our late father ate, drank and lived the sport. We want to train and develop tennis among the young ones, catch them young and hone their talents.” She added that the tournament is an open event for junior players across the country with the sole aim of complimenting the Nigeria Tennis Federation [NTF]. Also speaking at the event, National Junior Coach, Mohammed Ubale, said the tournament would help NTF to select players for international competitions. “We are so excited at NTF that the family decided to bring the tournament to Lagos and we believe this would give us the chance to select players for the national teams. “This is an open tournament for junior players across the country and we believe this will help to unearth a new set of talents for the country. Outstanding players from the tournament will be invited to the national camp in Abuja for a three-week camp ahead of some international competitions later this year,” he said. Explaining the format of the event, tournament referee, Arinola Isa, said it would feature U-12, U-14 and U-16 players in the round of 32 boys and girls, while players that fail to make the grade will battle for honours in round robin matches as all participating players will taste action during the competition. He said registration closes month end, adding that to prevent age falsification, all players must come with their international passports, which will be verified at the venue.
