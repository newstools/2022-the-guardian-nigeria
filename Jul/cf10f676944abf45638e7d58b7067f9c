In a series of tweets, the housemate claimed that she had kept quiet about the situation out of respect for those who were involved. Maria refuted claims that she had slept with married men, including a clergyman, as well. She wrote, “My Dear Nigerians, I understand we live in such a hypocritical world and everyone is a saint unless you’re in the public eye then your shi* stinks the most. I adore marriage and wish all those in a HAPPY marriage nothing but luck, I love and respect the idea of one man to one woman.” She further stated in her tweet, “I’m going to address this once and only this once. I’ve been quiet on the whole husband snatcher issue. I DID NOT ruin any home. My silence is for the best of so many people involved. That I haven’t said my piece doesn’t make me weak. I am respecting so many people involved and their privacy. And for the rumours of me sleeping with several married men, including a pastor , WE both laughed at it cause we literally breathe each other’s air day in day out and no room for dishonesty.” She continued to write, “When and if I ever start doing “runs” not that I have any intentions of this or knock anyone off their hustle but my man does look after me and my family are also very much okay to look after me and I work my ass off to look after myself. And also if I ever chop breakfast, I’ll chop it with ice cream.”
