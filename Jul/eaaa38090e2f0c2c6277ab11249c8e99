Such assistance is composed of fixed and variable instalments, the latter depending on the progress made with an agreed set of economic and social reforms.  EU direct support to the federal budget is aimed at supporting the implementation of Somalia’s National Development Plan (NDP-9) and supporting economic reforms towards achieving Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. With this payment, the amount disbursed to Somalia under this programme reaches EUR 71.9 million. EU Ambassador to Somalia, Ms Tiina Intelmann, noted: “President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud recently expressed his commitment to pursue political, security and economic reforms. This provides a basis for constructive engagement between Somalia and the EU. I am therefore glad to announce that today we have been able to resume our budget support operations. This is part of our commitment to support Somalia’s inclusive growth, reconciliation and state building efforts.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of EU Delegation to Somalia.
