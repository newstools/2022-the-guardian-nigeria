A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wanted wire fraud suspect, Fatade Idowu Olamilekan, has been extradited to the United States for allegedly stealing over $3.5 million worth of equipment across the American nation. His extradition was coordinated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the following notice from FBI, New York, through the U.S. Legal Attache for his role in reportedly impersonating various cities and academic institutions in the nation. EFCC’s spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement, yesterday, said Olamilekan was indicted by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York for “offences of wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen property and identity theft.” He added: “The suspect was arrested on September 30, 2021, by EFCC operatives and his extradition trial commenced sometime in November 2021 before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke of a Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos. “On May 1, 2022, the judge granted the request to extradite the suspect to the United States to answer the criminal charges against him.” “Upon his arrival in the United States, the suspect is billed to appear before a United States District Court.”
