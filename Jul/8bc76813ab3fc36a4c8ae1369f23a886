Appknox, an enterprise mobile application security solution firm and its African partner, CED Technologies have created awareness on the need for consumers to be security conscious in app usage. 
   
Speaking at a webinar with the theme, “How an insecure mobile app can tarnish your company’s reputation”, which had stakeholders mostly from the financial institutions across Africa, the Co-founder and CEO of appKnox, Harshit Agarwal, noted that the essence of the webinar is to encourage developers, security researchers and enterprises to build safe and secure mobile applications.
  
“We want to encourage more African Organisations to make a cultural shift from DevOps to DevSecOps by using best-in-class technology,” he said, adding that Appknox approaches security testing with an automated vulnerability assessment, which includes Static, Dynamic and API testing combined with manual penetration testing to ensure security is addressed all nine yards.  He explained that as African partner to Appknox, CED Technologies understands the pain points of businesses and how it can help address them bringing superior technology at an affordable rate while placing the importance on the personal touch in servicing clients.
  
“We strive to be the most trusted technology advisor for our clients as we stand behind our work and our clients in their needs. In the era of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for Mobile App Security we provide Appknox to our clients,” he stated.
   
He reiterated CED Technologies’ commitment to connecting businesses with the highest-rated and vetted software solutions in Africa.
  
Meanwhile, the duo of Harrison Nnaji, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at FirstBank and Lanre Adelanwa Basamta, Group Head, Mobile Financial Services at Interswitch Group, have advised organisations to add Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) to their IT policies before and after rolling out mobile apps into the market.
