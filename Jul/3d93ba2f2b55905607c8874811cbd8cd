The Young Progressives Party (YPP) House of Representatives candidate for Ihiala Federal Constituency, Johnmary Maduakolam, has declared that youths would decide the direction of the 2023 general elections in Nigeria. Maduakolam made this assertion when he received a group of youths under the aegis of Ihiala Progressive Youths (IPY) in his country home in Azia, Ihiala Local Council of Anambra State yesterday. Defending his stand, he explained that the 2023 elections have bestowed upon the youths the responsibility of deciding who wins at the polls, which, according to him, is contrary to what used to be the case in the country. He noted that ‘youths are the leaders of tomorrow,’ insisting that such belief has become real in this dispensation as youths have decided to take charge of the responsibility bestowed upon them by nature. He, however, urged youths to step up their activities beyond social media awareness, pointing out that elections are not won or lost on social media spaces.
