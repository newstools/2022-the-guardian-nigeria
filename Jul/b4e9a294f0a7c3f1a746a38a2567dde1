The administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in Enugu State, yesterday, expressed deep concern over the ordeal of the Senator representing Enugu West Senatorial District in the National Assembly, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Mrs. Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu, in the United Kingdom (UK). A statement by the Enugu State Government described Sen. Ekweremadu as an illustrious son of the state and a foremost Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The statement said the government and other good people of the state were saddened by the unpleasant news of their arrest, arraignment and subsequent remand in police custody in the United Kingdom. The statement conveyed the thoughts and prayers of Governor Ugwuanyi and the people of the state to the entire family of Senator Ekweremadu. “In this difficult time as we beseech the most merciful God to grant accelerated healing to Miss Sonia Ekweremadu,” the statement read in part. The state government extended its profound gratitude to the Federal Government of Nigeria and the National Assembly for their empathy, support, solidarity and legal intervention. It went further to appreciate the prayers of well-meaning Nigerians for early resolution of the issues.
