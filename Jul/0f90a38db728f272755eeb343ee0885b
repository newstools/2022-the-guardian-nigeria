August. Summer is often regarded as the best season because you can take advantage of the
brighter evenings to spend more time with your loved ones or even try something new. There are endless fun things to do this summer and they don’t even have to be huge experiences.
So grab yourself a notebook and start planning. With your own bucket list in hand, this summer
is sure to be the best summer yet.
1. VISIT THE OCEAN
Summer is the best time to visit the ocean for a day full of sand and sunshine. Build sandcastles,
search for seashells, play beach ball, paint while sipping some wine, fly a kite and reawaken your
inner child. You can also just lie on the beach and enjoy the sound of waves and sea breeze.
2. TAKE A FAMILY PHOTO
Taking a new family photo is such a great idea this summer. Make it a point to get your entire
family together this summer for a quality family photo. Whether you use the self-timer function
on your own camera or hire a professional photographer, this is a great time to take a photo that
you can hang at home and smile at every time you see it. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1797363 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-797x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-797x598.jpg 797w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-1536x1152.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-320x240.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-640x480.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920-600x450.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/watermelon-gd0896f019_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
3. READ A NEW BOOK
Whether you like to read a suspenseful thriller or a beautiful romance novel, you can use your
free time to try some self-care and get into a great book.
4. GO FOR A SWIM
Going for a swim in a lake, an ocean, a river or a pool will always make you relish the embrace
of cool water on a hot day. So enjoy a relaxing float or splash around with your family because
swimming is a fun way to get some exercise.
5. GOING TO THE GYM
Research has shown that people are generally more active during summer due to the longer hours
of daylight and the warmer weather. It is quite important to build muscle because building and
toning muscle bring benefits such as improving balance, burning fat and bone loss. And it can
also help you with daily tasks; it is essential that you add frequent visits to the gym into your
summer routine. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1797365 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-898x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-898x598.jpg 898w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-1729x1152.jpg 1729w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-1536x1023.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-640x426.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920-600x400.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/flowers-g96344c7a2_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
6. CONNECT WITH NATURE Summer time is the best time to connect with nature; the physical world collectively includes
plants, animals, and the landscape. One way of connecting with nature is by sleeping under the
stars to experience the breathtaking view the stars have to offer.
7. TRY SOME NEW RECIPES
Step away from your usual go-to recipes and try to make a unique meal. You can step outside
your comfort zone this summer by trying to make yourself and your loved ones a new dish.
8. TAKE A ROAD TRIP
Plan and take a stress-free weekend road trip somewhere new for just a couple of days that will
give you some fantastic new experiences. You can also switch it up by taking longer road trips
and seeing more places.
9. DETOX FROM TECHNOLOGY
Detox from technology for a few days by putting away your phone, your computer and your TV
for at least two or three days and allow yourself to bond more deeply with yourself, your family
and friends and nature as well. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1797367 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="719" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-1536x863.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay-600x337.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Zebra-in-Namibia-national-park.-Photo-Pixabay.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
