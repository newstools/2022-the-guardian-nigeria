The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), has assured that two special mission aircraft in the deep blue project fleet of the agency will be deployed to fight oil theft and protect the economy.  “The oil industry is critical to our national economy and no space of the sector should be left for criminals to occupy or operate. We have recorded gains in our maritime security efforts and more needs to be done to sustain and consolidate on these gains.
   
“Our collaborations with security agencies which we have MoUs with are to, among other reasons, ensure we work ahead of criminal elements. I am happy to state that our synergies have been beneficial to the country in many ways,” Jamoh said.
