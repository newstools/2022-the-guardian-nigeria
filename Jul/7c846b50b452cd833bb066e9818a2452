The Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) has assured the new transportation ministers of the full cooperation of port terminal operators in the discharge of their duties. The Chairman of STOAN, Vicky Haastrup, gave the pledge in a statement while felicitating the Minister of Transportation, Mu’azu Sambo and the Minister of State for Transportation, Mr Ademola Adegoroye, on their appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari. Haastrup expressed confidence in the ability of the new ministers to transform and fulfil the vision for the transportation and maritime sector for economic development. She said Sambo’s previous work experience in the maritime industry will help him succeed in the new task assigned to him. “We are particularly happy with your appointment considering your rich work experience and numerous contributions to nation-building both within and outside the maritime industry. “With your experience as the immediate past Minister of State in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, and previous work experience in the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Savannah Bank, Allied Bank, NICON Insurance Corporation, and as the General Manager Lagos Zone, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), where you meritoriously retired from public service in 2019 – we do not doubt that you will make a significant positive impact as the Minister of Transportation,” the STOAN Chairman said. She assured the new ministers that all the port terminal operators across the country will support them in the discharge of their duties as they move to boost the maritime and transport sectors, even as she prayed for God’s guidance for the duo in their new assignment.
