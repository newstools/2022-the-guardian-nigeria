CIG Motors is big on After Sales, and we have invested heavily in the country to develop After service. We have facilities in VI and Ojoto which used to be our SKD factory, but we have expanded to Ogba where we now have a CKD factory in partnership with Lagos state government. In a few months, we would be manufacturing GAC cars in Nigeria starting with 5000 cars in the first year and moving up to 50,000 in the next few years. Because of this, our sales channels will increase and I believe your cooperative will be beneficiaries of the benefits that will get to the end user.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1793490 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/APPROVED-FOR-CHEVRON-AND-CIG-SIGNING-1-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />
