There are fears that lives may have been lost and several others injured after jets belonging to the Nigeria Air Force (NAF), were reported to have bombed Kunkuna village, in Safana Local Government Area of Katsina State. The incident reportedly took place at about 11:00 pm on Tuesday, shortly after President Muhammadu Buhari’s advance team convoy was attacked by terrorists along the Dutsinma -Yantumaki road, in the Dutsinma council area. Dutsinma shares borders with Safana council area, and terrorists who operate in Dutsinma are often known to escape to Safana where the dreaded Zakka forest is located. Zakka forest extends into Zamfara state, and there are reports that forests within these areas are terrorists’ enclaves. It was learned that the jets were bombing terrorists that had ostensibly attacked president Buhari’s convoy when the incident occurred. According to sources, many of the villagers lost their lives when the bombs exploded while several others sustained injuries. It was also gathered that many homes were leveled to the ground in the process. Relevant security spokespersons in the state were yet to issue any statement on the incident at the time of filing this report. The council chairman and house of assembly member from the area were also unavailable to speak on the issue.
