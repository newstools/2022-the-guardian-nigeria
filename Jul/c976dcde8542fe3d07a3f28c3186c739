Pan-Igbo socio-political group, the South East Revival Group (SERG), has warned Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against the hasty decision to join the All Progressives Congress (APC), following the recent overtures by governors in the party to lure him. SERG said Nigeria is in its most difficult political period, such that any wise politician must not hastily undertake any political move or decision at this time. According to the South East group in a statement signed by its President and National Coordinator, Chief Willy Ezugwu, while reacting to the recent visit of All Progressives Congress (APC) governors from the South West of Nigeria to the governor, SERG counselled Wike to be careful and patient in taking any political decision not to lose the goodwill he had earned from the masses over the years as a performer. “As supporters of Wike, who is one of those we consider outstanding in the build-up to the recently concluded presidential primary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), we sincerely counsel the governor to be very cautious in taking political decisions at this time. “Whether the governor is aggrieved or not, even though we know he was betrayed during the presidential primary of his party, the political terrain in Nigeria is too slippery for hasty decisions by any wise politician in the country.”
