Former African champions, Enyimba and Kano Pillars are conspicuously missing from Africa’s latest top 20 clubs as released by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS). But, the current Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) leader, Rivers United, is listed as the continent’s 17th best team. The IFFHS recently released its men’s Continental Club Rankings for the year 2022, which considered the period of April 2021 to March 2022. Unsurprisingly, reigning CAF Champions League winners, Al Ahly, sit atop the standings as they have been for the last few years with the Red Eagles of Cairo dominating both domestic and continental competitions. The biggest climbers have been Raja Casablanca, who was in 10th place in last year’s rankings and now find themselves in second place, which is largely down to their CAF Confederations Cup win last season. Enyimba, who was formerly on the top 10 list, is not mentioned this time, perhaps, due to their recent poor performances, both domestically and on the continent. Also on the list are CR Belouizdad (third), Wydad Casablanca (fourth), Pyramids FC (fifth), Atletico Petro De Luanda (sixth), Zamalek (seventh), Mamelodi Sundowns (eight), JS Kabylie (ninth), Es Setif (10), Simba SC (11) and RS Berkane (12). South Africa’s Orlando Pirates are 13 on the list, which also has JS Souara (14), TP Mazembe (15), Al Masry (16), Rivers United (17), Esperance (18), Zanaco (19) and GD Sagrada Esparanca (20).
