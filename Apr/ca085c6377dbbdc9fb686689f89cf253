Indications have emerged that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) might conduct its presidential primaries on Saturday, May 24. A timetable being deliberated upon by the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) indicates that the governorship primaries have been scheduled for May 24, while May 19-21 is the tentative date for the conduct of primaries for House of Representatives and Senate seats. The proposed schedule implies that primaries for Houses of Assembly will hold on May 17. The schedule indicates that sale of Expression of Interest forms will commence April 22 and end May 7. National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, confirmed that sale of forms and conduct of primaries is being deliberated upon by the NWC. He, however, told journalists that members of the NWC are yet to reach an agreement on the issue. He said: “I can confirm that we have had discussions on it. But we have not made any decisions yet. We have not put out any information on the matter in public space. I will be in the best position to tell you when a decision is made.”
