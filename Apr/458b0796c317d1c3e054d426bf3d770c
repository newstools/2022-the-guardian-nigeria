The Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) has provided security operational vehicles to the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to ensure adequate security on the Abuia-Kano highway. Speaking in Abuja while handing over the vehicles to the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali, the Managing Director of the NSIA, Uche Orji, said enhancing security on the Kano-Abuja highway is necessary for achieving free movement of humans, goods and services. He said: “One of Nigeria’s most important highways runs from North to South. The Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Road forms a critical part of this larger highway system, enabling the movement of people and products from the North to the South and vice versa, thus uniting the Nigerian people and economy and connecting Nigeria to North Africa via the Lagos-Algiers Trans-African highway.” He stressed that to address the poor condition and deterioration of the road, Julius Berger was contracted by the Federal Ministry of Work and Housing with funding from the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF) to rehabilitate and reconstruct 375.9 kilometers of the dual carriageway. He explained that to bolster security during and after completion of the road project, the PIDF donated 16 Innoson five-seater double cabins pick up (IVM Carrier) to the NPF, saying this is an effort to deepen PIDF’s support for intervention in security. He said that with the donation, it is expected that the Police will offer enhanced support in surveillance, crime prevention and promote law and order. On his part, the IGP, who commended the gesture, said insecurity is a threat to economic activities across the country.
