Talking about Wizkid’s exit, Banky W noted that when the singer was ready to leave, he had not fulfilled the terms of his contract and had only released two of the five solo albums stipulated in his contract. Banky W said, “I think it was a five-album deal, and he had done two solo albums… I think he still owed three more albums, but he wanted to leave. And for me, that was enough because I don’t want anybody to stay where they want to stay.” When Ebuka asked if he (Banky W) had tried to convince Wizkid to stay, he replied, “No, because I could tell that mentally he was ready to do other things. For me, I just felt like some things are just meant to happen for a season, and that was the season we were meant to work together.” Banky also addressed Wizkid’s absence at his wedding to Adesua, noting that while he was disappointed, he knows Wiz tried his best.
