JJC’s son Bento hinted that these rumours might be true, commenting on a TikTok post of the crisis in the Bello home. In his comment, Bento claimed that after living with the actress for two years, “she’s not what you all think she is.” Adding that living with her was “horror.” He has, however, disabled all of his social media pages except his Youtube channel since making the comment. JJC and Funke Akindele got married in 2016 and have a set of twins together.
