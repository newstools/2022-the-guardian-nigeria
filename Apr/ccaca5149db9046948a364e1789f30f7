ADCnewtrybe, a learning platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), is to sponsor 300 youths for the House of Representatives in 2023. In a statement, the party’s National Director of Communications and Programmes, Ifenla Oligbinde, said ADC had launched #300Spartans movement. He said the initiative was to shortlist, screen, select and sponsor 300 Nigerian youths, who have the capacity, credibility and character to be responsible leaders. According to him, ADC is a third force political party and learning podium that had allocated 35 per cent opportunities to youths, women and persons with disabilities. His words: “Nigerian youths can now enjoy double benefits through the ADC. “Not only do youths, women and persons with disabilities have free forms in line with the party’s mainstreaming policies, the #300Spartans project will also create an avenue where a uniform number of credible and capable youths with enough grassroots experience can win seats at the House of Representatives.” He continued: “We already have (Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), companies and individuals who are willing to partner with us for this project. We will raise over N10 billion to fund these #300Spartans for their campaign and electioneering activities. Nigerians have been waiting for an opportunity like this to invest in a credible alternative, and we have created such a platform through the ADCNEWTRYBE. “This opportunity is open to youths, women, persons with disabilities and Nigerians in Diaspora. We would also conduct screening at regional level. We are already speaking to people of moral and social standing in the country to serve as our screening panelists. It would be an open and transparent process, and no one would be left behind.”
