Two years after failing with the Flying Eagles at the U-20 WAFU Cup in Benin Republic, Coach Ladan Bosso will, again, lead the seven-time African champions to Niamey, Niger Republic, for this year’s WAFU B U-20 Championship. The tournament will hold between May 7 and 20. Nigeria’s contingent will, today, fly into Niamey , where the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has arranged two friendly matches to put the team in premium shape and readiness for the competition. Two years ago in Cotonou, Benin Republic, Bosso’s Flying Eagles, against all expectations, were reduced to baby chickens, finishing with one point from two games in the group stage, following a 1-1 with Cote d’Ivoire and 0-1 loss to Ghana. The failure at the WAFU Cup stopped the Flying Eagles from participating in the 2021 U-20 Africa Cup of Nations, which was the final qualifier for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. Before then, Bosso had failed with the same Flying Eagles at the FIFA U-20 World Youth Championship in Canada, where Nigeria lost to Chile in the quarterfinal stage. That was in 2007. Ahead of the trip to Niamey, Bosso has selected a team of 30 players, who will compete against Ghana’s Black Satellites and the Young Etalons of Burkina Faso in Group B. Hosts Niger Republic, Benin Republic, Togo and Cote d’Ivoire will battle in Group A. The Flying Eagles will confront familiar foes Ghana in their first match of the competition on May 8, before taking on Burkina Faso three days later. Both matches will hold at the General Seyni Kountche Stadium in Niamey. Two teams will sail into the semifinals from each group, with the two finalists qualifying to represent WAFU B zone at the 2023 Africa U20 Cup of Nations. Egypt will host the 2023 Africa U20 Cup of Nations while Indonesia will host the 2023 FIFA U20 World Cup finals. All four semifinalists from the tournament in Egypt will qualify to represent Africa in Indonesia.
