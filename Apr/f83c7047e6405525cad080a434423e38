The Nigerian equities market sustained gaining streak to three consecutive trading sessions yesterday, as investors continue to take a position in some highly-capitalised stocks, especially Seplat and Nigerian Breweries (NB) causing market capitalisation to appreciate further by N182 billion.

The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Seplat Energy, Nigerian Breweries, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Chemical Allied Products (CAP) and Zenith Bank. Analysts at United Capital Plc said: “We expect continued bargain hunting, but we reiterate that the broader equities market remains on a bearish trajectory. The recent bullish momentum is a short-term reversal and absence of any underlying positive trigger will likely see the rebound short-lived.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “The positive activity continued in today’s session as seen in the green close across major sectors. We are likely to see this trend moderate tomorrow, as investors begin to take profit on some recent gainers.
