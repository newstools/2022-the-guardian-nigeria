Nigerian flag carrier, Air Peace, has received its fourth International Air Transport Association’s Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) certification, which signifies that the carrier was successful in the globally recognised and rigorous safety audit. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said the new certification has, once again, exemplified the airline’s commitment to global best practices in aviation safety. Olisa said that the airline is committed to observing the highest standards of safety in its operations and the consecutive success in the IOSA audits is a testament to this commitment. He expressed the airline’s resolve to continue to comply with best safety standards and promised more seamless connectivity, strategic route expansion to meet the flying public’s travel needs, and consistent fleet modernisation. Olisa commended International Air Transport Association (IATA)for continuously ensuring that stakeholders in the aviation sector worldwide comply with established safety standards while noting that safety is at the heart of the industry. Air Peace had set a record when it obtained its first IOSA barely two years into operations and was, subsequently, inducted as a member of IATA. The airline leads Nigeria’s aviation industry with 20 domestic routes, seven regional routes and two international destinations while it operates an increasing modern fleet of 35 aircraft, including five brand new E195-E2s and 5 Airbus 320s.
