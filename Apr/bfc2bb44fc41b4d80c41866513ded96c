For Nigerian ports to improve in the Ease of Doing Business (EODB), concerned stakeholders in the industry have urged the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) to stay away from the seaports.
   
The Director-General, SON, Mallam Farouk Salim, had recently sought the return of SON to the ports, claiming that this would strengthen its regulatory capacity and save the country from the influx of injurious goods.  He said: “It is important to state categorically that times have changed and our industry no longer thrives in the darkness of hidden trade information.”
