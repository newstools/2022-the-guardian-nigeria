The International Cricket Council (ICC) has scored Nigeria high in the organisation of the just concluded maiden Nigeria Women’s T20i Cricket Invitational in Lagos. ICC Regional Development Manager, Patricia Kambarami, who was present at the weeklong event in Lagos, commended the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) for the quality of planning and execution. Kambarami also appreciated the performance of the five nations, Ghana, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, The Gambia and host Nigeria, for putting up a good contest at the Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket oval in Lagos. “I must say that the organisation of this tournament and the quality are top notch. I could see that a lot went into making this tournament what it is and it is great to see the success. “It’s great to see how much countries like Ghana and The Gambia have responded in this tournament. It only shows that they will keep improving with more competitions, like the Kwibuka tournament in Rwanda coming up soon. “More importantly for me, is watching the excitement on the faces of the spectators. You could see the interest, participation and enthusiasm from the kids around and it tells you so much of how cricket has grown in the country. “I see this tournament improving with more competitors in subsequent events,” Kambarami said. The ICC official also said she was impressed with the quality of the Nigerian women’s team. “The women’s team has improved tremendously. I watched them in Zimbabwe in 2019 but what I am seeing now is impressive and I really must congratulate the NCF for what they have done with the team. It’s such a brilliant job,” she said.
