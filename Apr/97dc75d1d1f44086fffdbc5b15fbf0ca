Speaking at the ceremony, Gowon said the media outfits would contribute towards enhancing and sustaining the capacity of the Scheme to consolidate its achievements, as well as reach out to its global audience. He added that they would also serve as veritable tools for driving the quest for national unity, cohesion and purposeful development. General Gowon who commended NYSC Management for the achievement also urged them to sustain the tempo of its ongoing strides, which have kept the Scheme in the national and global limelight. “There is no gainsaying the fact that the Scheme has in almost five decades of its existence successfully harnessed the potentials of our graduate youths as models for defining patriotism, credible and quality leadership, as well as economic regeneration,” Gowon said. “I am always delighted to note that Corps Members have continued to render patriotic and selfless services to our dear country, especially as active participants in the implementation of national programmes such as elections, immunization, population census, advocacies on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers and HIV/AIDS campaign amongst others. “It is my sincere hope that these and other achievements would be given the widest publicity by the NYSC Radio and Television Stations, in order to elicit increased support from the general public.” Speaking further, he appealed for public support for the establishment of the NYSC Trust Fund which promises to be a game-changer for the NYSC, graduate youths and the Nigerian economy. He said, “l would like to appeal to all and sundry to give more support to the Scheme in its arduous task of promoting national unity, integration and development  in line with our vision.” In his address at the ceremony, the NYSC Director-General, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim said the establishment of NYSC Radio and Television Stations is part of the whole gamut of activities designed to further advance the cause of the Scheme. He added that the NYSC Radio broadcasts on Channel 88.3FM in Abuja while the NYSC Television runs on TStv Channel 365. “The philosophy behind the establishment of these stations is multifaceted. They will educate and entertain, give the Scheme a stronger voice to propagate its programmes and sensitize Nigerians on government policies, in addition to the promotion of national unity. They will contribute in redirecting the mindset of Nigerians, especially the youth, toward things that are noble. They are also meant to provide an avenue to train and hone the skills of successive batches of Corps Members interested in pursuing careers in the broadcast industry, particularly in the areas of production, TV/Radio Engineering, programme presentation, graphic design, content development, among others,” he added. The DG noted that the NYSC in almost forty-nine years has continued to provide successive batches of Corps Members with the requisite platforms to make meaningful contributions to national development in various aspects of national life, such as unity and integration, education, health, infrastructure,  participation in national elections, advocacies on social engineering and agriculture. General Ibrahim commended President  Muhammadu Buhari for his immeasurable support to the Scheme, adding that the sustained provision of resources for the Scheme’s operations and the latest gesture of approving and issuing Radio license to the Corps are clear demonstrations of his abiding faith in the NYSC Scheme. “Permit me to use this opportunity to thank His Excellency, General Yakubu Gowon  GCFR, Members of the National Assembly, the Honourable Minister of Youth and Sports Development and other Nigerians for expressing support.”
