The stock market extended losses to the second trading session in April as most highly capitalised stocks, especially MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN) and Guinness Nigeria depreciated, yesterday, causing market capitalisation to slump further by N8 billion. In summary, the all-share index (ASI) declined by 155.01 absolute points, representing a decrease of 0.33 per cent to close at 46,687.85 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalization value lost N83 billion to close at N25.17 trillion. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Guinness Nigeria, Lafarge Africa, PZ Cussons Nigeria and FBN Holdings. This week, analysts at United Capital Plc said: “We expect the equities market to remain relatively lull as investors continue to take profits off the table, especially in the absence of any expected positive trigger. “However, we note that the market is approaching oversold territory, which could spark some short-term bargain hunting. We retain a preference for investors to continue to seek selling opportunities to reduce exposure to the domestic equities market.” Analysts at Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “As expected, the market started mixed with a slight recovery in market sentiment, as investors continue to trade in line with the earnings report. We anticipate further mixed sessions amid bargain hunting activities across the board.” However, market breadth closed positive as 22 stocks gained while 19 others declined.
