Kid Cudi revealed that while he and Kanye West will rap on Pusha T’s new song, it’ll be their last project together, noting that the song was recorded before they fell out. He tweeted, “So I know some of you heard about the song I got w Pusha. I did this song a year ago when I was still cool w Kanye.” “I am not cool w that man. He’s not my friend, and I only cleared the song for Pusha cuz thats my guy.” “This is the last song u will hear me on w Kanye (sic).” The Day N Nite rapper fell out with West after he (Ye) dramatically dropped a planned collaboration with him (Cudi) from his then-unreleased Donda 2 album. Kanye had dissed Kid Cudi in an Instagram post back in February for being friends with “you know who.” Referring to Pete Davidson, who is his ex-wife Kim Kardashian’s new beau. In his now-deleted post, Kanye wrote, “Just so everyone knows, Cudi will not be on Donda because he’s friends with you-know-who. We all speak in Billie language now.” Kid Cudi was also quick to reply to West’s post, writing, “Too bad I don’t wanna be on ur album u f*****g dinosaur hahaha. Everyone knows I’ve been the best thing about ur albums since I met u. Ima pray u for [sic] brother.” “We talked weeks ago about this. You’re whack for flipping the script and posting this lie just for a look on the internet. You ain’t no friend. BYE” Since his estrangement from Kim Kardashian, Kanye has gone on several internet rants, making it clear that he did not like SNL comedian Pete Davidson, Kim’s bae and definitely disapproves of their relationship.
