The eight season-long series followed the lives of the Johnson family, an upper-class black family, as they juggled sociopolitical and economic issues living in America. First airing in September 2014, the series grew to be loved by many, recording millions of viewers and franchised into sub-series revolving around the personal lives of some of the Johnsons. The cast of the series took to Instagram to bid farewell to the show that had been a part of their lives for almost a decade. Ahead of the final episode, Anthony Anderson (Dre Johnson) shared a clip from the episode, writing “Tonight marks the end of an era that has made such a monumental mark in not only my life… but also in my Co-stars, the Team at ABC, staff & crew and all of the guest stars that we have had on this show as well!”” “What this show has done and shown for the culture and African American families… really all American families overall, will never be forgotten.” “I am humbly honored…” he added. “Emotions are running the full gammet [sic] from joy, pride, sadness… Adoration and more! #Blackish is truly and forever will be one of my profainly [sic] proudest moments.” Penning her tribute, Tracee Ellis Ross (Rainbow Johnson) shared a video compilation of her time onset along with some of her costars. “If you thought @blackishabc was funny, the moments between takes gave the show a real run for its money!” she captioned the post. “We had so much fun at work. Here are just a few of the fun moments we had. They say the family that plays together, stays together. And even though these incredible humans were just my tv family, I think that means we’re forever .” Other cast members, including Jenifer Lewis (Ruby Johnson), Marcus Scribner (Andre Johnson), Miles Brown (Jack Johnson), Yara Shahidi (Zoey Johnson), also penned tributes to the show’s end. Fans of the show also took to Instagram to commemorate the show’s final episode. Last year, ABC announced that Black-ish, created by Kenya Barris, would end after eight seasons.
