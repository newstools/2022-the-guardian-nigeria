Barring any last-minute change, the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, will ‘in a matter of days’ disclose his position on the 2023 presidential election. A top presidency source told The Guardian last night that Osinbajo feels it’s the right time to address the 2023 issue with regard to his ambition, considering the fact that the election is close. “I can now tell you not just soon, but in a matter of days. It will be a significant address. “Things are still in flux so won’t say definitely the number of days, but this is no longer something that will go past a few days for sure. For instance, expectations were that this week, the party will announce the calendar but that has not happened,” the source said. It’s not, however, certain if the nation’s number two man will declare interest to run or step aside due to his loyalty to former Lagos governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is believed to be his political godfather. Tinubu has since declared his interest in the number one seat and has now commenced consultations across the country. Though many groups had emerged in support of Osinbajo’s candidacy, the VP is yet to make a clear statement on his 2023 ambition.
