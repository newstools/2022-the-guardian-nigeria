This raw material was Xiaomi’s muse while creating this unique souvenir, because 2017 was also the first year the XFF campaign started to reach out to Xiaomi fans worldwide. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1715581 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-2048x800.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="800" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-2048x800.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-1062x415.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-1536x600.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-320x125.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-640x250.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Third-Image-600x234.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" />
