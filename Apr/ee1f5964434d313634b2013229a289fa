The show’s new season would be split into two parts, with Volume 1’s release scheduled for May 27 while Volume 2 starts streaming on July 1. Stranger Things creators and executive producers, The Duffer Brothers, recently announced that the show will end by the fifth season. The fourth season stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, and Maya Hawke. The trailer clip begins with Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink) sitting by the grave of her stepbrother Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery), who had sacrificed himself to save Eleven in Season 3’s finale. “Dear Billy, I don’t know if you can even hear this,” Max says. “Ever since you left, everything’s been a total disaster.” In a brief shot, the trailer also hints at Eleven regaining her powers, as we see the character scream as others are propelled away from her.
