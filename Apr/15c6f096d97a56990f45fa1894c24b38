A member of the board of trustees of Tiger Golf Club, Odogbo, Ibadan, Colonel Adewemimo Sunmonu, is thrilled that the club’s course is now laid out in an all Green ‘putting’ surfaces. Sunmonu, a passionate golfer to the core, disclosed that he is in constant awe anytime he recalls that a club that was formed as mere nine-hole recreation facility for men of the Nigerian Army in 1999 by Major General Ekpo Archibong, has quietly grown to become one of the nation’s best courses. This, he said, is heart warming. “I can easily recall how General Dambazzau, as Chief of Army Staff, sent in funds to transform the course to a full blown 18-hole course in 2008,” Sunmonu said. “From this point, several members of club, from the first Captain, Chief Oke, to the late legal luminary, Chief Richard Akinjide, made it a personal task to develop the club, even at their own expenses. The result is what we have on ground today… Greens that can surpass that of any Club in Nigeria,” he said. According to Sunmonu, “The development is not about construction of the Greens alone. We can also boast a 23-room hotel right on the course. At the moment, the club has over 500 members. The priority of the management is to grow membership strength to 1000 before the close of the year. In fact, I can see the sky as the limit for this Club.” Also speaking on the rise of the club, Oke, also a former Captain of the Ibadan Golf Club, commended the man, who built the first Green on the 18th hole of the course, Major General Igbai Akintunde, as well as Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde and Chief Adekele, a trustee, who placed on ground tractors and slashers for maintenance of the Club.
