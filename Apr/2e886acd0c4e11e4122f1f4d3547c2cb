President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the flood disasters in Kwazulu Natal Province of South Africa that have so far claimed 341 lives, saying he was “unspeakably devastated.” Reacting to the calamity yesterday in Abuja in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President said: “I’m greatly shocked by this large-scale natural disaster which has caused widespread sufferings and fatalities in our sister country.” He explained that, “the disruption of water and electricity supply, as well as the destruction of homes, makes this natural disaster one of the worst in our recent memory.” While extending his sympathy to the government and people of South Africa, President Buhari urged other African leaders “to work together towards developing common and effective strategies for improving our emergency management response systems that will help us significantly reduce the human and economic impacts of natural disasters and impending climate change.”
