Tisha Cyrus filed for a divorce based on “irreconcilable differences.” According to sources it is the third time that both will be separated. In 2010, Billy RayCyrus filed for a divorce which the singer withdrew six months later saying in an interview that “I’ve dropped the divorce. I want to put my family back together.” Their divorce was revealed in a joint statement by the family’s representative which read “It is after 30 years, five amazing children and a lifetime of memories, we have decided to go our separate ways — not with sadness, but with love in our hearts. We have grown up together, raised a family we can be so proud of, and it is now time to create our own paths.” “We will always be family and look forward to a continued and loving shared experience as friends and parents. We have not come to this decision lightly or quickly but with so much going on in the world, we wanted to provide some clarity and closure, so we can remain focused on what is important. With Love and Hope… Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus.”
