Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) Plc has boosted its fleet of Ground Support Equipment (GSE) with more ultra-modern equipment. The new fleet of equipment acquired includes 10 Passenger Step Units (PAUs) that were manufactured by Mallaghan, an Air Starter Unit (ASU), two units of Airmarrel High Loader LAM 7000 and 20 baggage carts produced from locally sourced materials. Corporate Communications Manager of the company, Uansohia Adetola, said the PAU has the capacity to provide passenger access to a wide range of aircraft, which includes B747, B777, B767, A340, A380, A320 and so on. Also, the equipment is fitted with proximity sensors, which are devices that shut down the equipment engines when they are positioned too close to the aircraft to prevent aircraft damage. The equipment in the new fleet is an Air Starter Unit (ASU), which is used to supply necessary quantities of air at a specified pressure to aircraft while it is parked. Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SAHCO, Basil Agboarumi, said the company’s management decision to constantly invest in modern ground handling equipment is due to the fact that SAHCO is always pursuing excellent services to clients. “As always, we are an aviation ground handling provider and what we stand for and want to be known for is not just to provide services but to provide excellent services and we have an understanding as an organisation that for us to be able to provide that kind of services, we must have staff that are well trained in what they do and have the right equipment to work with.” SAHCO is a publicly listed aviation ground handling service provider that is present in all the commercially operated airports in Nigeria, which are: Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt, Owerri,Calabar, Ilorin, Enugu, Maiduguri, Gombe, Ibadan, Jos, Asaba, Benin, Bauchi, Uyo, Sokoto, Kaduna,Yola, Bayelsa, Warri and Anambra.
