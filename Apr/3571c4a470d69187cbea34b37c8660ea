The battle for the top four of the English Premier League is heating up as the season is gradually coming to an end. Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and Manchester United are all in a fierce contention to book a place in the UEFA Champions League next season. With Arsenal’s last appearance at the UEFA Champions League in March of 2017, Mikel Arteta and the entire Arsenal team and fans are desperately eyeing the spot to break the five-year jinx of not playing in the elite league. Still basking in the euphoria of their 4-2 win over Chelsea on Wednesday, Arteta is expected to be ruthless as his side welcomes Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium today after United’s 4-0 loss at Liverpool. But the announcement of Erik Ten Hag as the new manager who will take over from interim coach, Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season is expected to infuse some confidence in the struggling Red Devils as they keep their hope to make the top four within sight.
