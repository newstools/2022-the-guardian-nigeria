A Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday, fixed Friday, April 29, for re-arraignment of Precious Chikwendu, on allegation of attempted murder of her former husband, a former aviation Minister, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, and children. 
  
Chikwendu, alongside others, will be re-arraigned before Justice Inyang Ekwo on 14-count charge. Others are Emmanuel Anakan (first defendant), Prisca Chikwendu (third defendant) and Osakwe Azubuike (fourth defendant), while others are said to be at large.
 
The defendants were earlier arraigned before the court on February 14 on 13 counts.  Justice Ekwo adjourned the matter shortly after the police prosecutor, John Ijagbemi, applied for the amended charge to be read to defendants for them to take their plea.  The defendants were further alleged to have committed offences bordering on cybercrime, intimidation to kill the former minister, among others 
 
They were also alleged to have criminally used the internet to send abusive messages with intent to bully, defame and harass her ex-husband.
 
They were alleged to have fabricated false evidence by deposing to series of affidavits that Chief Fani-Kayode physically and sexually assaulted members of his domestic staff in inhuman conduct by causing same to be electronically published in a national daily.
