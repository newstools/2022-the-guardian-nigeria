• Wants fund spent on productive sectors
Center for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE) has advised the Federal Government to expend the N4 trillion for fuel subsidy on productive sectors.
 
Its Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Muda Yusuf, who gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, cautioned that the fund, if not properly channelled, could be detrimental to the macroeconomic environment.
 
NAN reports that the House of Representatives approved the payment of N4 trillion as subsidy for Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS), popularly known as petrol.
 
The resolution followed President Muhammadu Buhari’s request for revision of the 2022 Fiscal Framework at plenary presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase.
