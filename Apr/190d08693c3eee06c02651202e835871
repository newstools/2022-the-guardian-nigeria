The newly inaugurated board of the Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN) has granted CSED (Community Sport and Educational Development) Initiative request to be its partner in developing the sport at the grassroots level in the Niger Delta area and Taraba State. In the approval letter dated April 8, 2022, signed by BFN President, Francis Orbih and Secretary General, Lilian Chinonso Obilor, the BFN thanked the trustees of CSED Initiative for willing to support the BFN in discovering and nurturing Nigeria’s future badminton stars. In his response, CSED Trustee, Cornelius Ehimiaghe, said the CSED Initiative is honoured to be given the opportunity to contribute to the development of badminton in Nigeria. He said CSED hopes to support BFN by providing basic badminton equipment, including rackets, shuttlecocks and nets for beginners, support in holding training courses for P.E. teachers, as well as in providing online and face-to-face safeguarding training to BFN coaches and administrators at the state and national level. According to him, safeguarding of athletes has been made a priority by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for national sports federations. “CSED Initiative will support the BFN in striving to meet this responsibility through our providing the BFN free access to the services of qualified foreign and home-base social workers, who can deliver training on the safeguarding of athletes and minors that take part in sport,” he stated.
