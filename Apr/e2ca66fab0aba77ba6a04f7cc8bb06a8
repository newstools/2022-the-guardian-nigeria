In another fresh attack, bandits, yesterday, stormed Agban Kagoro Community, Kaura Local Council, killing two persons and injuring several other residents. A resident, Jonathan Musa, told journalists that the terrorists came in large numbers, shooting sporadically into the community and in the process not less than two persons got killed with many others wounded. Confirming the incident, the former Chairman, Kaura Local Council, Kumai Badu, said those injured had been taken to the hospital. Kaduna residents have been under constant attacks for some time now, with high casualties. It would be recalled that terrorists recently attacked the Kaduna International Airport, killing a security man, aside from attacking the Kaduna-Abuja train, killing eight and kidnapping scores. When contacted for his reaction to the latest attack, Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), ASP Mohammed Jalige, did not pick up his calls.
