(Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP) Will Smith after the Oscars incident, has resigned from Hollywood’s Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Will Smith described his action after slapping Chris Rock at the ceremony as “shocking, painful and inexcusable.” “So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate.” Disciplinary action against the actor is yet to take place as the board is divided on the issue.   The president of the film academy, David Rubin, said the Academy accepted Smith’s resignation but says it does not stop the academy from taking actions as the  next meeting is due on 18th April. Will Smith has made headlines since his slap on Chris Rock at the Oscars after a touchy joke was about his wife’s bald head due to alopecia. In acknowledging the implication of his actions at the Oscars he said in a statement “I betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.” However, it was uncertain if Rock knew that Jada Pinkett-Smith had a medical condition that results in hair loss.
