Rentit, a digital technology company that enables seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) rental services has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing carbon footprint and maximising existing resources. The company, which has paid asset owners who listed their items on its platform about $35,000 since it started operation, said it had enabled over 2000 P2P rental transactions since 2019. Speaking at a media parley in Lagos, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Rentit, Seun Abimbola, said the company built a platform that connects asset owners to those who want to rent. Abimbola said beyond connecting renters with those who need to procure items, Rentit also manages the movement of rental items as well as installation where required, between both parties. Abimbola said: “People rent things like Agbada, wedding gowns, drones and cameras. Even in the construction space, people rent bulldozers, cranes, graders, and forklift among others. We are also involved in space management like party venues. “One of the problems that we like to solve as an organisation is that we realise that people have idle equipment they don’t use all the time. For instance, if you are getting married and a wedding gown is N250,000, it doesn’t make sense to buy I; just rent it. We have had instances where people are going for interviews and had to rent suits from us.” He said there is also a sustainability angle to the business as it helps to reduce carbon emissions and maximise resources. “The most important thing for people who own the assets is to make sure that the assets are secure and safe. We have partnered with an insurance startup company, Kurasel, to provide real-time insurance for every item that is rented on the platform that covers theft and damages,” he said.
