The Lagos State First Lady’s Open Championship will return today with over 180 players vying for various prizes at the Ikeja Golf Club. The biennial tournament was last held in 2014 before politics and COVID-19 halted the gathering of the country’s best women players at the prestigious Ikeja Club. According to the organisers, Lagos State First Lady, Dr. (Mrs) Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, is expected to perform the ceremonial tee-off of the championship initiated by Ikeja Golf Club’s former Lady Captain, the late Mrs. Bose Ransom Kuti, to help grow the game among women and also provide exercise for the body and mind. The championship debuted in 2014 during the administration of Babatunde Fashola, but it was suspended during Akinwunmi Ambode’s tenure.  It could not hold in 2020 due to COVID-19 and its attendant economic problems. Speaking on the championship, Vice Lady Captain of Ikeja Golf Club, Busola Ladipo, said: “I am happy that the First Lady Championship is finally back in my time. It will be the third edition because we could not organise the tournament since 2014, owing to circumstances beyond our control, particularly in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
