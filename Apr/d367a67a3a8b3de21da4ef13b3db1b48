Taking to Instagram, the soon to be Dad wrote ‘‘Marriage and kids are a natural part of a strong relationship filled with love and respect. Fatherhood is something I have always looked forward to and I don’t take lightly. It is the most important job I will ever do.’’ Britney, who had revealed on her Instagram that she is pregnant, referred to Sam as her ‘husband’. It is uncertain if the two have secretly wedded as the couples have not confirmed it.
Spears revealed her pregnancy status on Monday via her Instagram account stating that she noticed she had gained weight when on vacation and then decided to test for pregnancy which turned out positive.
In addition Britney explained the challenges she faced ‘It’s hard because when I was pregnant I had perinatal depression.’
‘‘I have to say it is absolutely horrible… women didn’t talk about it back then … some people considered it dangerous if a woman complained like that with a baby inside her but now women talk about it everyday … thank Jesus we don’t have to keep that pain a reserved proper secret.’’
Spears said her conservatorship left her ‘‘traumatised’’ saying in court ‘‘I am not happy, I can’t sleep. I’m so angry, it’s insane. And I’m depressed. I am traumatised. I just want my life back.I want to end this conservatorship without being evaluated. This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good. I deserve to have a life, I’ve worked my whole life. I deserve to have a two to three-year break.’’
Her conservatorship ended in November 2021.
