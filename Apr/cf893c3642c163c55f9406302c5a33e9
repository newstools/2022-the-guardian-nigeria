•Pledges to develop constituency if elected An aspirant for the House of Representatives, Ihiala Federal Constituency, Johnmary Akachukwu Maduakolam, has given his support to the clamour for a president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Maduakolam, campaigning on the platform of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), gave his backing while fielding questions from newsmen at Nnewi, Anambra State, yesterday, insisting that it is a legitimate demand. He stated that the issue of marginalisation of Ndigbo and the South East region would be addressed if an Igboman emerges the president of Nigeria in 2023. He pointed out that it is only right for all lovers of fairness and justice in the country to support the aspirations of people from the South East to produce the next president irrespective of their tribal and political affiliations. “The quest for Igbo Presidency is legitimate and since there are qualified Nigerians from all its parts, supporting an Igbo candidate will surely deepen democracy and help calm  nerves,” he said. He restated that his programme designed for the constituency would add to development and growth of people in the area, as well as Anambra state in general. “I have worked out a template for initiating four development centres in the four zones in ihiala Local Council. The centres will serve as the constituency offices and will be coordinating activities in the zone,” he noted. He said other programs include to ensure that youths have access to pursue their educational dreams, backed up with quality and functional assurance scheme to bridge the gap between private schools and public schools, adding that there will also be revolving loans made available to youths who want to go into agriculture among other assistance opportunities.
