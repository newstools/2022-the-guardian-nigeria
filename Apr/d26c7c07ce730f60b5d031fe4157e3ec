The suspended Chairman of Kano Public Complaint and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimin-Gado, has been arrested by the police. The embattled Rimin-Gado was said to have been arrested Thursday in Abuja shortly after he picked the PDP gubernatorial nomination to succeed Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. An attempt to arrest Rimin-Gado by the operatives of the police failed recently when the security laid siege to his Kano residence. Prior to his arrest, Rimin-Gado had raised alarm on an attempted threat to his life by unidentified persons he claimed were trailing his movement. The spokesperson of the Police Command in Kano, SP Abdullahi Haruna who confirmed the arrest of the former anti-corruption boss, said he would be brought to Kano. Haruna said Rimin-Gado would be charged for forging his medical certificate.
