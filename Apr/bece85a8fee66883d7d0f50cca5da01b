As part of its contribution to the over 250,000 new entries target by the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), Ogun State cricket has been boosted by the Abinu Kondoti Foundation, which has supplied some equipment and resources to meet the target. According to the initiator of the Foundation, Mathew Conditti, the aim is to nourish hopes through education and sports. He said the primary school initiative, held at the weekend, is part of the Foundation’s plan to give renewed opportunities for children to learn something new while pursuing their education. He added that cricket is the right tool to drive home this vision. The disclosed that the project had earlier conducted a train-the-trainer programme for games masters and coaches in October last year in Abeokuta, adding that it later sponsored 10 coaches on a monthly basis to coach in 30 primary schools across the four educational zones of Ijebu Ode, Ayetoro, Sagamu and Abeokuta. 27 schools across the state competed during the preliminary rounds of the programme held on April 1, 2022, with the top two teams from each zone qualifying to the final of the Abinu Kondoti Foundation Cup held on Saturday in Abeokuta. Identifying its importance as part of her growth goals, the NCF supported the event with donation of junior involvement equipment to the eight qualifying schools, while the Ogun State Foundation, through Elder Sola Adeyemi, took the opportunity to donate junior equipment on behalf of the Foundation to four other schools. In his speech, Mr. Seyi Sonde of the Ogun State Cricket Association thanked the Abinu Kondoti Foundation for the initiative and urged coaches involved in the programme to take advantage and continue the work started five months earlier. He also encouraged the games teachers to continue supporting the game.
