Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Rivers State has denied allegations of withholding the expression of interest and nomination forms of some members after making payment. Some aspirants in the party had staged a protest at the PDP secretariat in Port Harcourt on Wednesday with their bank draft and tellers alleging that they were denied the forms after making payment. The state Publicity Secretary, Tambari Sydney Gbara, in a statement, yesterday, doubted if the protesters were actually members of party. The party spokesman argued that if the protesters were PDP members, they should have known that “all forms are printed and sold at the national secretariat in Abuja as approved by National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Working Committee (NEC) of the party. He explained that the state secretariat does not sell forms and has no business with the sales of forms, maintaining that only the national secretariat is saddled with the responsibility of doing so. He said: “The truth is that aspirants in the state with the intention to buy forms were directed on how to go about it and obtain their forms, no money was paid to PDP Rivers State chapter for nomination forms.” He, however, advised the protesters to go back to where they paid for their forms, to obtain them and not to disturb the peace at the party secretariat. Contacted, one of the protesters, Kinikanwo Ogbu, said he was in a meeting and could not speak with the  reporter.
