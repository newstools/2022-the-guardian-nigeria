A 16-year-old survivor, yesterday, narrated before a Lagos Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, how her 43-year-old biological father, Emmanuel Odega severally defiled her since her mother left for South Africa in 2014. Narrating her ordeals before Justice Ramon Oshodi, when she was led-in- evidence by the state counsel, Ms. Bukola Okeowo, the survivor said, prior to the incident, her mother had relocated to South Africa. She told the court that her father had been having carnal knowledge (sex) of her at the age of 14, noting that the defendant (father) told him that the “holy spirit” instructed him to have sexual intercourse with her. She said: “I was 14 years when the incident happened. It initially started with him touching my body. When I noticed this, I moved my body from him. I told my twin brother about it the next morning, but he shunned and did not believe me. “The next day, he had sex with me that very night. I could not shout or do anything because my father threatened me.” The teenager further told the court that, her father continued to sleep with her after they moved from their location and relocated to a wooden apartment in Badore area of Ajah. On cross-examination by the defence counsel, Mr. Buhari Momoodu, the survivor said she had once been raped before her father allegedly had canal knowledge of her. In his testimony, the second prosecution witness, a forensic examiner at Mirabel Centre, Dr. Oyedeji Alagbe, told the court that his findings showed no fresh injuries to the vagina, but repeated forceful vagina penetration. After listening to his testimony, Justice Oshodi adjourned till June 6, for the continuation of trial.
