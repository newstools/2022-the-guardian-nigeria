There was tension in Yola, Adamawa State, yesterday, as armed policemen took over the House of Assembly premises to prevent Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members that defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from gaining access to the chambers. The lawmakers, who are still in recess till June, hurriedly resumed yesterday when PDP members started defecting to APC. There was a protest at the Assembly by constituents of Michika, whose representative, Joseph Kwada, defected from PDP to APC last week. Leader of the protesters, Mr. Koji Garta, told newsmen that they were protesting against plans by a few PDP lawmakers to declare vacant the seat of Michika constituency for defecting to APC. “When APC lawmaker, Musa Bororo, defected to PDP, there was no problem; when another member from African Democratic Congress (ADC) decamped to APC, there was no problem. Why is the situation of our members different? If he has committed any offence, the party (APC) should approach the court, not PDP lawmakers,” he said. Garta, who assured Governor Ahmadu Fintiri that Michika would not vote for him for a second term, pointed out that they stand with their member Kwada. On why he defected to APC, Kwada told journalists that PDP in Adamawa had been reduced to the governor’s private enterprise. “How can I remain in a party where there is no justice, a party run like a private business, a party where sincerity and justice are the most scarce products? No, let me free myself from this ‘Animal Farm’ in Adamawa PDP,” he said. When journalists visited the Assembly, hundreds of fierce-looking policemen were seen blocking the entrance with their vehicles. Journalists were told that the Speaker was in a closed-door meeting with few lawmakers.
