Convener of Governing The Nations Conference (GTNC), Ikenna Nsofor, has urged Christians to get involved in governance with a view to addressing Nigeria’s economic and security woes. Making the appeal, yesterday, at the maiden GTNC in Lagos, Nsofor, who doubles as the Pastor in-Charge of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), The Word Church Parish, Area 11, said that the vision “is to create a platform for Christians to get into governance, especially politics, because it is a pivotal role in the nation’s development.” He charged Christians on paradigm change in 2023, urging them to register and get their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) to effect the change.  “It is wrong to say politics is a dirty game. It is better said that the people who play politics, if they are dirty, play dirty politics. “But if we have people with the right mindset playing politics, it won’t be dirty.” Similarly, the Managing Director, Cedar and Coleman, Benjamin Dike, said the reason Christians are not getting it right is because there is no conscious effort to groom a set of people, who have the right mindset and what it means to lead and govern. He said when Christians get involved in key sectors of the economy for the purposes of doing what is right, the entire nation and the world will be a better place. Dike noted that there is an urgent need to teach and groom great competences in Christians and good people who want to go into politics and other fields.
