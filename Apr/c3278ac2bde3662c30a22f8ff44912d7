Known for his role as Dominic Toretto in the franchise, Vin Diesel shared a photo on Instagram on Saturday announcing the Larson’s new role. The two are photographed with broad smiles in the picture as she rests her hands on his shoulder.   A post shared by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel) “Yeah yeah yeah… you see this angel over my shoulder cracking me up, you say to your self ‘that’s captain Marvel,'” Diesel captioned the pic. “Clearly there is love and laughter in this image.” “What you don’t see however, is the character you will be introduced to in Fast10. You have no idea how timeless and amazing she will be in our mythology. Beyond her beauty, her intellect… her Oscar, haha is this profound soul who will add something you might not have expected but yearned for. Welcome to the FAMILY Brie.” The Hollywood Reporter had previously reported that Jason Momoa would join the 10th instalment of the franchise directed by Justin Lin. Fast and Furious 10 is scheduled for release on May 19, 2023. The show’s main actors, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, Sung Kang and Charlize Theron, will appear in the series. F9 was released on June 24 following its delayed release due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to Uproxx just after her Nissan ad at the Super Bowl, Larson replied “one hundred per cent” when asked if it was her dream to appear in a Fast & Furious movie. “Please, please tell everybody I would, of course, want to be in a Fast & Furious movie,” she gushed at the time. “I’m obsessed. I love them. I think they’re so good. They’re so fun. And they’ve made me appreciate cars. And it’s something that should be appreciated. They’re incredible. So, of course, please.”
