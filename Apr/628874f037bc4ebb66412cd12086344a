The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has denied arresting Eberechukwu, the wife of the immediate past governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano. Report making rounds on Thursday said the former Anambra First Lady, who has been under investigation, is currently in the custody of the commission in Abuja for alleged fraud. But EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren told The Guardian that the former Anambra First Lady was not in the custody of the anti-graft agency. In a terse response to The Guardian enquiry, Uwujaren did not provide further details but said the report of her arrest is ‘not true’. Obiano’s wife had caused a stir after she became involved in a faceoff with a former Nigerian ambassador to Spain, Bianca Ojukwu, during the swearing-in of Prof Chukwuma Soludo as Anambra State Governor on March 17. She is seeking to contest in the 2023 elections to represent Anambra North District at the Senate under the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance.
