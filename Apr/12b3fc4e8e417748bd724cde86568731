The FCT Police Command has sought legal advice over the autopsy report on late gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu. It would be recalled that the ‘Ekwueme’ singer died on April 8, 2022, after allegedly enduring years of domestic violence from her husband Peter Nwachukwu. The late singer’s husband, Peter Nwachukwu was arrested after the family reported the matter to the police and several indictments by his children on cases of domestic violence. The case has since been at the State Criminal Investigation Department in FCT, as the police carried out an autopsy on the late singer. Giving an update, the FCT Command spokesperson, Josephine Adeh said Osinachi’s case has been transferred to the Department of Public Prosecution for legal advice. “The case is no longer with us. It is now with the DPP in the office of the Attorney-General,” Adeh told newsmen.
The case was reportedly transferred after the release of autopsy report.
