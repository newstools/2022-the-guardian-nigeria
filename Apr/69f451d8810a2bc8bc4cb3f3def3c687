A Nigerian wire fraud suspect, Adedunmola Gbadegesin, has been extradited to the United States, where he is wanted in a case of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. His extradition was coordinated by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, following a request from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, pursuant to a February 11, 2022 Order by Justice D.E Osiagor of the Federal High Court, Lagos, in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/765/21, which granted a request to extradite the suspect to the United States to answer to criminal charges bordering on a romance scam, wire fraud and money laundering. Gbadegesin, who was arrested on September 2, 2021, is alleged to have defrauded an American lady living in Kentucky, United States, of over $148,000 EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren in a statement on Wednesday said the offences contravene Title 18, US Code, Section 1349 and 1956 (h) and carry a maximum jail term of 20 years. “Upon arriving in the U.S, the suspect is billed to appear before a United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, where two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering have been filed against him,” Uwujaren added.
