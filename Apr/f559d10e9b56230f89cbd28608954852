Last December, Drake and Chris Brown were sued for copyright infringement by a pair of songwriters, Brandon Cooper and Timothy Valentine, who allege the song steals from their 2016 track I Love Your Dress. However, Drake was dropped from the lawsuit on Wednesday, while Cooper and Valentine will continue their case against Brown and Sony Music Entertainment. “It is hereby ordered and adjudged that defendant Aubrey Drake Graham a/k/a Drake is dismissed with prejudice and without costs or attorneys’ fees as against any party,” the court documents read. “In dismissing this case, the Court notes that Mr. Graham started from the bottom—being named as a defendant—now we’re here—a dismissal with prejudice.” Chris Brown released No Guidance featuring Drake in June 2019, and the song peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. No Guidance was also included in Brown’s album, Indigo. In their defence, the duo of Chris Brown and Drake had argued that they never heard I Love Your Dress, which they labelled “obscure.” However, the plaintiffs contend that being more famous than other artists should not immune you to copyright law. “This argument – essentially that defendants are somehow immune from copyright infringement claims by individuals who are not as famous as they are – is both egotistical and without any legal basis whatsoever,” the two said in February. “Undoubtedly, regardless of their fame and status, defendants may be, and should be, held accountable for their infringement.” If Chris Brown’s motion to dismiss the case is denied by the judge, the case would head to trial.
