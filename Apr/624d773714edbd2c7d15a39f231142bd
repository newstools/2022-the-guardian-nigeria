The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Apapa Area Command, has generated over N264.5b as into the Federal Government coffers in the first quarter of 2022.
   
Customs Area Controller, Compt. Yusuf Malanta Ibrahim, in a review of the first quarter operations of the Command said that the amount collected represented a 65.7 per cent increase when compared to N159b generated in the same period in 2021.
 
He said: “This amount collected N264.5b  shows a significant increase of N104 billion as against N159b collected in the corresponding months of the year 2021, representing 65.7 per cent increase in revenue collection.”
 
Yusuf attributed the increase in revenue to improved service through the information technology (IT) platforms, which he said helped to plug revenue leakages, and sustain the level of compliance by importers and other stakeholders in the cargo clearance value chain.  The Comptroller listed the seized items to include unregistered medicaments such as tramadol and codeine syrup, unprocessed wood, used clothing and footwear, foreign parboiled rice and other sundry items that fall under prohibition list.
 
He added that the items contravene sections 46 and 47 of Customs and Excise Management Act, CEMA CAP C45 LFN 2004.
 
Yusuf urged stakeholders to join forces with the Command and ensure that items that are on the import/export prohibition list are strictly adhered to and also prepare for the emerging realities of customs examination through non-intrusive inspection (NII) regime.
