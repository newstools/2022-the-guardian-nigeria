 Keeping Up With the Kardashians – BRIAN BOWEN SMITH/E! ENTERTAINMENT The Kardashian-Jenner family has asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss Blac Chyna’s economic and emotional distress claims in her lawsuit against them, describing these claims as ‘absurd’.   People Magazine reports that according to court documents obtained, the family’s attorney, Michael G. Rhodes, had argued that Chyna (real name Angela White) offered “no documentary evidence, economic analysis, or expert testimony” to support her claims. Rhodes representing defendants Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kris Jenner in the case, said, “Before trial began, these claims were absurd.” “Now that Plaintiff has testified in her entirety, and has no additional testimony or evidence to offer on her damages, Defendants respectfully submit that entering such an instruction would be a vastly inadequate remedy.” Rhodes further argued that Chyna had offered no accounting to support her request for $109,635,021 in economic damage and $36,000,000 in general damages for emotional distress. “Ms. White’s unsupported and wildly speculative claims for damages must not be allowed to go to the jury,” the document reads. The documents also reveal that Chyna conceded in her testimony her appreciation to Kris for her efforts to air Rob & Chyna and provide her with accommodation. She, however, admitted that her reputation was hurt mainly by her ex, Rob Kardashian, who is not named in her claims for economic damages. Blac Chyna and the Kardashian family have been in a legal battle since 2017 after Chyna sued Rob and his family in October of that year, accusing them of damaging her brand and abusing her. The lawsuit was filed after Rob leaked nude photos of Chyna on Instagram and accused her of drug abuse, alcohol abuse and infidelity.
