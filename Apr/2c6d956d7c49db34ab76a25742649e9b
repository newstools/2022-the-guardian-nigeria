Athletes intending to participate in the eighth Okpekpe International 10km Road Race can now get the registration forms at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos and the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, the organisers have disclosed. Pamodzi Sports Marketing, organisers of the race, said: “Registration for the Okpekpe Race is not limited to online platforms and we are delighted to announce the two places where forms can be picked up physically and returned. “Registration for the race commenced last month on our various online platforms and it is open to all categories of runners. “The race is not only for professional athletes, who want to run for the prize monies on offer or to improve on their times for ranking purposes, it is also open to people who want to run for fun or for charity.”
