Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has said the nation desperately needs a leader with political will and courage to decisively end the scourge of insecurity and revive the ailing economy.
 
A statement by the Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, noted that the governor made the observation while addressing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegations from Borno and Yobe states in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, yesterday. The governor observed that in the past seven years, the security and economic situation in the country had deteriorated due to the incompetence of the current All Progressives Congress (APC) Federal Government. He said, “I came here today because there is problem, and that problem is that Nigeria is dying and we must not allow Nigeria to die. We must rescue this country. So, I came as a Nigerian, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, a party I have never left since 1998 till now. A party I have worked for and will continue to work for. “And so, I want to run for the presidency of this country under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. I came because I feel concerned, I came because I have no other country to run to and therefore, I have come to offer myself to solve most of the problems that this APC administration could not solve.” In his welcome address, the Borno State PDP leader, Mohammad Imam explained that he was one of the friends who purchased the expression of intent and nomination forms for Wike because they were convinced of his capacity to lead Nigeria out of its current socio-economic predicaments. Imam, who spoke on behalf of PDP delegates in Borno and Yobe states, decried the nonchalance shown by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government to issues of security that has crumbled business in the two states. He said they were looking up to Wike to rescue Nigeria, guarantee safety to Nigerians and improve the economy.
