The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said “the minor fire outbreak” at its branch at Makurdi, Benue State, yesterday, was successfully put out. The Director, Corporate Communications, of the apex bank, Osita Nwanisobi, who stated this in Abuja yesterday via a statement, said the fire, which broke out around 7 am Thursday, was swiftly checked a moment after it was detected. He hinted that the alertness of the bank’s security personnel as well as the facility management units acted in unison to bring the situation under control. “The prompt response of the Bank’s security and facility management units as well as support from the Benue State Fire Service helped to fight the fire and prevented any damage the fire might have caused to the main office building,” he stated. Reports indicate that the fire started from the fuel dump behind the branch building sending smoke into the atmosphere, the director said, adding: “Fortunately, there were no fatalities. The affected site has since been cordoned off for further investigation. Normal work has also continued at the branch. “We hereby assure the general public that the minor fire that occurred has been effectively put out and no damage was done to the Makurdi branch of the Bank.”
