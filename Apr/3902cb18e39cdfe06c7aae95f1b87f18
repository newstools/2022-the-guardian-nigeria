Despite coming out tops in his weight category at the recent 2022 national trials for the Commonwealth Games held at Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos, Delta State-born Cyprian Miracle’s hope of representing the country in Birmingham, United Kingdom, still hangs in the balance. Miracle, who won gold medal at the last 2020 National Sports Festival hosted by Edo State, is in the Ibadan, Oyo State camp alongside Micah Frank Damini vying to be selected for the Games, holding between from July 28 to August 10 in Birmingham. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Miracle, who said his target is to travel out for better exposure and also improve on his game before the next Olympics, now has a chance to fulfill his ambition. “The situation in camp right now is fine and we are doing our best. Everyone is training extremely well to make the cut for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. “Even though I won at the recent trials among about 16 judokas, no one is sure yet who will make it to the Commonwealth Games.
 “This is because the camping is still in its first phase and there is a second phase, which we do not know when it will hold. “There is a tendency for the first phase of camping to be appraised before the second phase holds. Though we do not know what is going to happen, all we are doing is to train well and get ourselves in good shape in case anything happens,” he said. Miracle, who had told The Guardian at the Edo 2020 Sports Festival in Benin City that the sport got him out of the streets, added, “Hopefully, I still see myself making it to the Commonwealth Games to fulfill my ambition,” he stated.
