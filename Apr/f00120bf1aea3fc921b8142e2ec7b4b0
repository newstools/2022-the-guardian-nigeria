Analysts at Afrivest Limited said: “In the next trading session, we expect the positive performance to be sustained on the back of the improved market sentiment and release of favourable Q1, 2022 earnings.” United Capital Plc said the tone of the market would be dictated by the outcome of the ongoing Q1, 2022 earnings season. According to them, “further positive takes may strengthen investors’ resolve to remain bullish on the market but we note that the bourse is due some short term correction following the steep uptrend observed in consecutive weeks.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Positive sentiments continue to fuel the market’s bullish run amid impressive Q2 numbers from companies that have already released their financial results. We expect corporate disclosures to dictate market direction in the short-term as investors take a position in anticipation of other Q2 results.” UPDC Real Estate Investment Trust recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent to close at N3.85 kobo.
