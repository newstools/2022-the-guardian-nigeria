MTN Nigeria, the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) and La Liga, the men’s top professional football division of the Spanish football league system, have announced a partnership to support the development of grassroots football in Nigeria, through the establishment of the NPFL/La Liga U-15 Youth League. The announcement was made at Ikenne, Ogun State, with representatives of MTN, NPFL, LaLiga and ValueJet in attendance.
 
The partnership will ensure continuous local and international exposure for Nigerian youth football, capacity building for players and coaching talents, which ultimately contribute to the advancement of developmental football in the country.  “It is worthy to note that this year’s (2022) edition is the fourth.  Some of the players who participated in the first and second editions have been called to play and captain the U17-national team and the U-20 national team, while others ply their trades abroad, which has been a great source of revenue for our participating clubs.
 
“We are excited to see a player like Akin Amoo, who was a part of the class of 2017, making the Super Eagles squad for the just-concluded World Cup play-off matches.
 
“This clearly depicts the enormous potential of what we are doing and now with the finest touch of MTN and the continuous exceptional support of La liga, the sky is the limit for this project,” Dikko stated.
 
“At MTN, our love for the beautiful game is palpable in our investments in Nigerian football. Our commitment to developmental football is expressed in this partnership with the NPFL. We aim to provide and support avenues to identify and coach the best young footballing talent in Nigeria, ultimately promoting grassroots football in Nigeria,” Adia Sowho, Chief Marketing Officer, MTN Nigeria, stated.”
