The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has sought the support of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) in curbing the activities of extortionists and other forms of illegalities along the roads leading to Apapa and TinCan Island Port Complex. Acting Managing Director of NPA, Mohammed Bello-Koko  The Managing Director of NPA, Mohammed Bello Koko, while receiving the AIG Zone 2 Command, Bode Adeyinka Adeleke, and his counterpart in the Maritime Police Command Ibrahim Kaoje at the weekend at the NPA headquarters had lamented the proliferation of illegal checkpoints along the ports corridor and got the consent of the two AIGs to join the NPA management on a spot check of the port access road to ascertain the reality on the ground. The spot check was conducted on Sunday 24th April 2022 and had in attendance the NPA management and the two AIGs, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police and a representative of the Lagos State Government. Indeed confirmed the reality of several illegal checkpoints which the AIGs promptly issued directives to be dismantled with a marching order to the Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPO) to ensure the sustainability of orderliness as they will be held accountable for breaches going forward. Further to this, a special mobile court has been assigned by the Lagos State Government to assure speedy dispensation of justice and fast track the prosecution of persons arrested perpetrating acts of extortion, unauthorized collections, illegal checkpoints or any other unwholesome practice inhibiting the ease of doing business around the ports. It will be recalled that previous efforts at curbing the acts of extortion being aided and abetted by uniformed men and other officials of government had been hampered by issues of jurisdictional overlaps between the Ports Authority Police Command (PAPC) and the Lagos State Police Command. With this partnership between the NPA and the two Police Commands whose jurisdiction covers the Lagos maritime logistics ring, it is expected that those conducting business in the ports will heave a sigh of relief.
