Peace is far from returning to Lagos State Council of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), as a group of elders in the council has petitioned Lagos State Government, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (IGP) in charge of Zone II and the State Commissioner of Police, alleging that the union President, Tajudeen Baruwa, is trying to cause chaos in the state. The petition followed the recent setting up of a nine-man committee by the  NURTW president to run the affairs of the Lagos council for three months after the dissolution of the State Administrative Council (SAC) Baruwa had during the inauguration of the committee appealed to the Lagos State Government to ensure peaceful coexistence between the union and the state government. But the elders in a letter, signed by its Chairman, Elder Samuel Jonah, Secretary, Comrade Stephen Falusi and three others – Alhaji Alao Adewuyi, Alhaji Alamu Otegbeye and Comrade Bola Lemboye, accused Baruwa of running the union like his personal property without recourse to the Constitution. In the letter, they asked why  Baruwa would challenge the authority of the state government by appointing another caretaker Committee to run the affairs of the union when the government had already appointed a park management committee for peace to reign in the state.
