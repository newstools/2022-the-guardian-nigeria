Lagos State Police Command, yesterday, rescued a 67-year-old man, who attempted to jump into the lagoon on his birthday.
The man, identified as Oluwatoye Bamigboye, hails from Oju–Ore in Ogun State and was attempting to jump into the Lagos Lagoon inward Lagos Island, when officials of Rapid Response Squad (RRS), on patrol of the Third Mainland Bridge, stopped him. A statement by RRR said Bamigboye on interrogation, claimed that a personal challenge made him sell his house, land and car. When he could not still raise enough money to fix the problem, he obtained a loan, but the problem still persisted. Bamigboye stressed that he was later offered a job, but on resumption, he was informed that the job had been given to someone else. “Today being my birthday, I have decided to end it all. The burden and the frustration is too much for me to bear. “My wife has abandoned me in the process,” he was quoted to say in the statement. The RRS said Bamigboye had been taken to Adekunle Police Station in Yaba, Lagos, where efforts were on to contact his family members.
