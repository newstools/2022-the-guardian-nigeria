• Faults Amaechi’s timing for presidential declaration Civil rights advocacy group, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), yesterday, counselled the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed to speak less about the ongoing terrorism in Nigeria because of alleged half-truths and propaganda.  “If a public referendum is to be conducted today amongst consumers of media contents in Nigeria, especially information emanating from the Federal Government headed by President Buhari, it is very likely that almost 100 per cent of those polled will give the feedback that information emanating from the current holder of the office of the minister of Information and Culture is taken with pinch of salt and not a lot of public confidence is built by virtually all of the statements made so far by the minister.  ALSO, HURIWA has faulted the declaration for the office of President by the Transportation minister,  Mr. Chibuike  Amaechi when the nation is still mourning unlucky train passengers killed by terrorists in Kaduna on their way from Abuja.  “In his little ministry of transportation, hundreds of innocent passengers attacked by terrorists are still in pain and many have died from the dereliction of duty displayed by the officials of the nation’s transportation sector.” “The timing was totally inappropriate for Nigeria’s transportation minister,  to have declared his intention to contest for president in 2023,” the group declared.
