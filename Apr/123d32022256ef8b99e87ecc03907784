Asset recovery has been discovered to be a powerful tool in the fight against local and global corruption. It is noteworthy that global corruption now costs around $1 trillion yearly. Moreover, Asset recovery is an overlooked means of returning money to countries and people from whom it was stolen. It can be used to provide development funds in impoverished countries like Nigeria and among nations most impacted by corruption.
 
However, the private sector is key to fighting corruption. Everyone bears the burden of corruption. Our political and economic systems need to be grounded in transparency, accountability and integrity from now. The release of Pandora Papers, nearly 12 million leaked financial records, exposes the extent to which the world’s wealthiest and powerful use legal loopholes to launder money, avoid paying taxes and hide assets.
 
While much of the financial activity isn’t illegal itself, it is precisely the type that is used to conceal the proceeds of corruption. More than 330 public officials in more than 90 countries, including 14 current world leaders, have been implicated in the papers’ release. This trove of information provides us with a guide to how the global cost of corruption has swelled to around $1 trillion yearly, (more than $20 to $40 billion of that loss from developing countries) and also insights into how to fight it.
