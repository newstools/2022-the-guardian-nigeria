A member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Technical Committee, Dahiru Sadi, has said that Salisu Yusuf was the best among the coaches presented to his committee by the football Federation for appointment as CHAN Eagles coach. NFF First Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, had last week challenged journalists at the MTN/NPFL/La Liga U-15 football tournament to ask the technical committee why they endorsed Yusuf for the job, despite the bribery scandal that led to his one-year ban from all football related activities. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Sadi said he was confused by the uproar raised over the issue, adding that the committee knew about Yusuf’s case before arriving at picking him as the best choice. “Coach Salisu, like every other Nigerian, has the right to be a coach of the national team. Even the bribery scandal was planned because he was framed up. Now that he has finished serving the punishment and has been punished for that, I do not understand again why people are making noise everywhere. “In the list of coaches given to us by the NFF to choose from, we eventually chose Yusuf because he was the best for the job among other coaches listed for the CHAN Eagles. “In the committee are Paul Bassey, Aminu Kurfi, Isaac Danladi, Victor Ikpeba, Mutiu Adepoju and myself. What we did was to also look at coaches who can work with the CHAN Eagles head coach as assistants.”
