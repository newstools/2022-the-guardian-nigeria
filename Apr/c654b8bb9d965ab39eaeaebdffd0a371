Woods has added another start to his itinerary. The 15-time major champion, who tied for 47th in last week’s Masters in his first official start in more than 500 days, will play in the JP McManus Pro-Am, a two-day event in Ireland beginning 10 days before The Open Championship, reports golfweek.com. Following the final round at Augusta National Golf Club, Woods told Sky Sports he would play in the 150th Open Championship at St. Andrews, the Home of Golf. However, Woods did not commit to playing the PGA Championship in May at Southern Hills Country Club in Oklahoma; Woods won the 2007 PGA there. Woods said he’d try to play. Woods will be making his fourth appearance in the JP McManus Pro-Am July 4-5. The event is played at Adare Manor, which will host the 2027 Ryder Cup. Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm, and Collin Morikawa also have committed to playing the Pro-Am. If all goes well, Woods will play in the Open Championship July 14 to 17. He won the Claret Jug on the Old Course in St. Andrews in 2000 to become the youngest player, at age 24, to complete the career Grand Slam. He also won the 2005 Open at St. Andrews. “Tiger has been a great friend and avid supporter of the Pro-Am for a very long time, and we are absolutely thrilled he has committed to play once again in the tournament,” McManus said in a statement. “His presence at Adare Manor will undoubtedly bring huge excitement to the thousands of spectators, and we are very grateful to him for giving up his free time to be with us.”
