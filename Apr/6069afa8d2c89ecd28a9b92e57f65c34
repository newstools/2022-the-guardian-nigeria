John Stones recovered from a muscle problem in time to start at right-back for Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday. Pep Guardiola had a selection headache with first-choice full-backs Joao Cancelo and Kyle Walker ruled out by suspension and injury respectively. Oleksandr Zinchenko deputises for Cancelo at left-back. Stones normally operate at centre-back and has been given the tough task of keeping Vinicius Junior quiet in an unfamiliar role.
