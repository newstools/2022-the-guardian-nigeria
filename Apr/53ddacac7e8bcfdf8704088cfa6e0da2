The general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye on Sunday disassociated himself from partisan politics. “I have said it before, and I will say it again, I am not and will never be a politician, I am a pastor – that is what God has called me to be,” Adeboye said at the April thanksgiving service. “Please do not distract me. My assignment is to be a pastor; to pray for you, to pray for nations including Nigeria.” Pastor Adeboye’s reaction may not be unconnected to a recent circular by the RCCG for the creation of a Directorate of Politics and Governance in the church. Political analysts suggest that the RCCG might be positioning itself to be politically active in the 2023 general elections in Nigeria. Current vice president Yemi Osinbajo, a pastor in the RCCG, is rumoured to have the ambition to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari with the newly created department to mobilise support for his ambition. Adeboye, who spoke extensively on the current state of Nigeria, said it will be unfair on other members of the RCCG who are members of different political parties for him to be partisan. “In the Redeemed Christian Church of God, every political party is heavily represented; APC, PDP, APGA, Labour and other parties you don’t even know their name,” Adeboye said. “I have never told you which party to vote for whether in secret or in the open. “So it will be unjust to tell you to support one party over another.” The cleric noted that Nigeria might be sliding gradually towards bankruptcy, citing cases of oil theft in the country. “It is in the news that 80% of oil in Nigeria is stolen and taken out of the country. Who is stealing the oil? “Who is buying the oil? Are you even sure that the people buying the oil have your interest? If these continue, we might be sliding to bankruptcy.” Adeboye also expressed fears for the economic future of Nigeria, stating that the debt to service revenue ratio might pose danger for decades.
