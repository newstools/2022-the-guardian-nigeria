Chinyere Chukwueke outclassed Oluwadara Gbadegeshin to retain her title in the 11 to 13 years category, just as Damisa Mandela won the girl’s 14 to 16 class. Suntar Ahenjir won the girl’s eight to 10 category by beating Ayomipo Ayorinde, while Khalid Muhammed defeated Oreva Atebe for the boy’s eight to 10 title. Mayowa Orungbeja beat Kobi Ajene in the boy’s 11 to 13 class, just as Lamar Baba-Eko topped the boy’s 14 to 16 class by beating Amar Gafar. An exhibition match between Mandela and Ahenjir, both adjudged among the star prospects, was won by the former 3-2. 
At the end of the clinic, Ikoyi Club 1938 Tennis Section chairman, Akeem Mustafa, commended the kids for their sportsmanship conduct, saying that the prospect exhibited by the children has now strengthened Ikoyi Club Tennis Section’s desire to develop Nigerian tennis at a higher pace. “This has been a hugely successful programme and we are delighted the kids have performed so well and we are going to back them up with more clinics and tournaments so that they can reach their full potential in the nearest future,” he said.
