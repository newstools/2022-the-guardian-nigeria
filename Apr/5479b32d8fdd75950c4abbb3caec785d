Since the allegation by ex wife Amber Heard, Depp has been dropped from films like the ‘Fantastic Beast’ franchise and many others. “Hollywood studios don’t want to deal with the public backlash from hiring someone accused of abuse,” he said. “A false allegation can devastate a career.” Depp filed the defamation complaint against Heard in the United States after losing a separate, high-profile libel case in London in November 2020 that he brought against The Sun for calling him a “wife-beater.” In 2016, Heard sought a restraining order against Depp. Their divorce was finalized in 2017, with Heard receiving a $7 million settlement. A panel of seven jurors and four alternates is hearing the case between Depp and Heard, who had a starring role in “Aquaman.” Both Depp and Heard are expected to testify, along with actors James Franco and Paul Bettany and billionaire Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk, Heard’s former boyfriend. The trial, presided over by Judge Penney Azcarate, is expected to last several weeks.
