Days after a victim of the Kaduna train abducted last month was delivered of a baby, the picture of the newly born girl delivered in the terrorists’ den has been released. It would be recalled that the baby’s mother was eight months pregnant when she was abducted by terrorists on the Abuja-Kaduna train route on March 28. A month after the incident, a woman was delivered of a new baby girl. The picture of the new girl, it was gathered, was released on Wednesday evening by the terrorists suspected to be Ansaru, a breakaway group of Boko Haram. Investigations revealed that the terrorists invited a doctor to assist during the delivery session.
