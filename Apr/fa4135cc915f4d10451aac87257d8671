Disney, Universal, Warner Bros Sony Pictures and Paramount which are the top Hollywood giants have all ceased releasing new films there.   This has thrown the Russian cinemas into a turmoil of the latest blockbusters. However this has not changed the mind of Grekova against President Vladimir Putin. “It’s the West that I hate today and not Putin,” the 56-year-old said. “Bollywood may replace Hollywood in Russia, but it’s too late for me to learn Hindi,” she said, referring to India’s refusal to condemn Moscow or join in with sanctions. Russia’s film industry has been thrown into turmoil by the fighting in Ukraine just as it was beginning to recover from the pandemic. And like in many sectors hit by sanctions, the film industry is turning away from the West, looking inward to its own movies or east to Asia. Russians are keen cinema-goers having the highest number of admission in Europe, 145.7 million last year, according to the European Audiovisual Observatory. Many flock to see Hollywood films, which are often dubbed instead of being shown with subtitles.
