The Commander Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) and General Officer Commanding (GOC) Three Division of the Nigerian Army, Jos, Major General Ibrahim Ali, has called on Plateau and Kaduna states’ youths to distance themselves from acts capable of compromising the collective peace of the people, while urging them to take the lead in society’s developmental ventures.
    
Speaking at the Maj. Gen. I. S. Ali Peace and Unity Cultural Day celebration in Sanga Council of Kaduna State and the First Peace and Unity Gwash Ball Final Tournament held in Jos, Ali explained that sports promote affection, team spirit, community of interest, love for one another and comradeship. He charged the participants to be peace ambassadors in their respective communities and embrace the spirit of sportsmanship to foster cohesion, love and togetherness for meaningful development.
 
In one of the football matches organised as part of the event, Plateau Para-Soccer team were held to 1-1 draw by their Kano counterparts. There were also competitions in para–swimming, deaf football and powerlifting.
 
Plateau State is participating in nine out of the available 15 sports lined up by the organisers, the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development.
