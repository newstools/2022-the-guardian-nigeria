Ikotun residents and members of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) are excited with the news that the wife of late Prophet Temitope Balogun Joshua, Evelyn is set to begin open services after the first anniversary of the late cleric.
 
Since the death of the founder of SCOAN on June 5, last year, Evelyn has been grieving the death of her husband, while the church premises have remained a ghost town as the gate of the church has been closed and guarded by security men.  Recently, Pastor Evelyn visited Ghana for a programme and miracles and deliverances took place. It was not even a crusade; it was a visit to a programme. So you can see.”
   
Every year, SCOAN hosts thousands of national and international visitors. People travel from around the world to witness and receive the mighty work that God is doing in the life of the late Prophet T.B. Joshua. According to a report, 80per cent of foreigners who visit Nigeria are visitors of SCOAN. MEANWHILE, traders in the area have expressed optimism and joy at the news of the church reopening.
  
A trader who sells beside the church, Basirat said, her business has been down leading to a downturn since the weekly services were put on hold.
  
Another trader, Chibuzor Okeke, who owns one of the biggest bars in the area, said patronage has reduced from 159 customers to 10 daily.
