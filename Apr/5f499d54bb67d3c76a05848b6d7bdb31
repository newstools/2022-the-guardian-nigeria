Over 900,000 children, between the ages of zero and 59 months in Cross River State, will be vaccinated against poliomyelitis. The Obol Opol of Ugep, His Royal Majesty, Ofem Ubana Eteng, flagged off the vaccination, yesterday, in his palace at Yakurr Council. At the ceremony, the Director General of the Cross River State Primary Healthcare Development Agency, Dr. Janet Ekpenyong, said: “So far, no record of poliomyelitis type 2 variant has been recorded due to the collective efforts of all stakeholders, including the traditional, religious and political leaders determined to see a healthier Cross River State.” She described immunisation as the right of every child that  should not be deprived, saying the state government, with support from partner agencies, had mapped out strategies to get all children vaccinated irrespective of weather conditions, topographical challenges and other barriers, which hindered accessibility and 100 percent coverage in the past. On his part, the Obol Opol and the host of the event said he was excited that an exercise of such magnitude was being decentralised to encourage participation and give  sense of belonging to all communities in the state.
