A septuagenarian politician in Gombe State, Abdullahi Jalo, yesterday, said that the just held All Progressives Congress (APC) convention was put up to spite the party’s National Leader, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu. In particular, he noted that the emergence of Iyiola Omisore as the scribe of the party was a direct slap on Tinubu because he was not carried along. He said that Tinubu was visibly disturbed to learn of a unity list that favoured the candidature of Omisore, adding that Tinubu was not consulted on the list that produced Omisore as APC secretary. He spoke while addressing newsmen in his office. Jalo, who was the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but now a chieftain of the APC in the state, however, urged Gombe State Governor, Muhammadu Yahaya, to concentrate more on human capital projects to win Gombawa to his side in his quest for second term. “ Yahaya has majority of people following him because he has money. The only thing that will stop his ambition is if he refuses to spend money, that is the language people understand here,” he said. “If money flows in Gombe politics and supported by the power of incumbency, Yahaya will win.
“If the governor knows his way and I believe he does, second term will be easy for him,” he argued.
