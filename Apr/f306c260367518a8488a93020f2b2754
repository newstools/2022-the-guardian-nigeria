Knox Wire has concluded an arrangement to host top Nigeria’s bank executives and other financial institutions on the provision of financial solutions. In the statement made available to The Guardian, the firm said the increasing global demand offers financial institutions cross-border payment opportunities. It said it would formally introduce Knox Wire at a conference holding in Lagos today and would be joined by partners.
 Commenting on the development, the Country Representative, Sweetapple Capital, Bode Akinboye, said the conference would feature meetings and discuss integration agreements. The firm said Nigeria’s GDP is expected to reach $445 billion by the end of 2022 and boasts of the highest remittance inflows in Africa. “Knox Wire has garnered huge attention among Nigerian financial institutions and is set to provide an RTGS platform that is not only one of the most feature-rich but is also unparalleled in its speed. “Knox Wire is one of only three major global solutions but greatly improves upon current offerings by leveraging a correspondent network for off-network payments, advanced technical features to provide near-instantaneous cross-border transactions, anti-money laundering transaction monitoring to prevent fraudulent activity, and a system that integrates seamlessly with existing financial systems,” it stated.
