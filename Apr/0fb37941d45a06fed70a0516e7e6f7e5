The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) has commended the Mining Cadastre Office (MCO) for providing an opportunity to sensitise their staff on the 14 CCB guidelines. Chairman, Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), Prof. Muhammad Isah, said this in Abuja while presenting an award of honour to the Director-General of MCO, Mr. Obadiah Nkom. Isah, who was represented by Prof. Samuel Ogundare, said: “It became necessary to collaborate with MCO to sensitise its staff. Cadastre office is the agency that has identified with the task of making public officers comply with the code of conduct as enshrined in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Many agencies and ministries do not know what we do in CCB by bringing their staff together for the interaction. But MCO made some of its staff available for our sensitisation programme recently, which is worthy of recognition. “We want to identify with Cadastre office to strengthen their ethical structure and ensure that staff comply with all the guidelines that will make the business of government very successful and transparent. Nkom said MCO would collaborate more with the Bureau to move the country forward.
