The reign of the bulls continued unabated on the equities sector of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), as investors’ increased appetite in the consumer and industrial goods lifted capitalisation further by N2 billion. Specifically, the All Share Index (ASI) rose by 3.18 points, representing an increase of 0.01 per cent to close at 48,571.75 points while the overall market capitalisation value gained N2 billion to close at N26.186 trillion. The upturn was impacted by gains recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Presco, Guinness Nigeria, Vitafoam Nigeria, Cadbury Nigeria and BUA Cement. Reacting on market performance, analysts at GTI Securities Limited said: “The market closed positive, as investors increased buying interest in the Consumer goods and Industrial sectors extends market bullish run to six successive trading days. We expect positive sentiments to persist, as investors take positions, as companies’ Q1, 2022 financial result rolls out.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “As seen in today’s market breadth, the positive sentiment has started to wane as investors take profit from previous gainers especially in the banking sector. We are likely to see similar trading pattern tomorrow given the market’s recent rally.” However, market sentiment, as measured by market breadth closed negative as 23 stocks declined, relative to 18 gainers.
