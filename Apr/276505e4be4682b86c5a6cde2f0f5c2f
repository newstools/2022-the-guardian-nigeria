Blue Note Africa was created with the focus to giving African jazz the global presence by signing African Jazz artiste with the intention of promoting cultural dialogues through their works. Blue Note Africa will resume operations with the release of the album The Spirit Of Ntu by South African pianist and composer Nduduzo Makhathini. According to CEO of Universal Music Africa, Sipho Dlamini “Blue Note has stood the test of time by continuing to adapt but keeping its focus on discovering and introducing Jazz talent to the world. The opportunity to create Blue Note Africa and provide a channel for African Jazz talent to have a home in the U.S., with a dedicated and passionate team led by a legend in his own right – Don Was, is very exciting. We can now walk the African Jazz journey, from Cape to Cairo to California.”
Dlamini added “African music has been a major creative tributary for nearly every album in Blue Note’s extensive catalogue,” says Blue Note President Don Was. “So it’s a great honour for us to partner with Sipho and his talented Universal Music Africa team in this new endeavour. Together, we will shine a global light on the incredible music emanating from Africa today.” Nduduzo Makhathini who leads the jazz world in South African, was signed in 2018 by Universal Music Group Africa. His second work Modes of Communication: Letters from the Underworlds was jointly released on Blue Note Records. The album named “Best Jazz Albums of 2020” by The New York Times, earned recognition across Africa, Europe, and the United States.
