The Management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO), has declared that contrary to some spurious online reports, its Managing Director, Dr. Jamil Isyaku Gwamna, has not been relieved of his position. KEDCO also explained that its banker (Fidelity Bank Plc) has not in any way taken over the management and activities of the company as was insinuated in the online news platform. According to the Head, Corporate Communications, Ibrahim Shawai, who briefed some journalists in Abuja, any news about the sack of such a high-profile industry player is usually through the Board and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE). “There is no way a sensitive decision like the sack of a Chief Executive Officer of a Disco could be conveyed through an unserious and ethically-challenged online platform, which has been found to be the only source of the baseless information,” Shawai said. “It is on record that KEDCO under Dr. Gwamna’s leadership have recorded very impressive achievements, building the company from scratch to one of the best DisCos in the country. “Consequently, to insinuate that the MD has been sacked based on financial mismanagement is nothing, but a well fabricated tissue of lies aimed at suppressing Dr. Gwamna’s very impressive curriculum vitae.” He disclosed that the fact that Dr. Gwamna has announced his intention to become the next governor of Gombe State, must have frightened some shady characters into weaving spurious claims against him. “As a law abiding citizen, Dr. Gwamna knows he will do the proper thing to face his political ambition based on the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in order to commence full scale partisan political activities,” Shawai said. “The news outlets and their management, have been given seven days to apologise and withdraw their unfounded report or face legal consequences for their malicious publication that was obviously aimed at serving whatever interest.”
