Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said that there is nothing wrong with the Constitution, contrary to the agitation of many Nigerians. He said that the nation’s problem was that of leadership and those who are executing the Constitution. Obasanjo stated this yesterday during the second International Christian Leadership colloquium with the theme, “The African Christian Leadership: Radical Transformation in Unsettled Times,” organised to mark the 61st birthday of the Pastor of Trinity House and Chancellor, Wellspring University, Ituah Ighodalo, held in the church premises at Victoria Island, Lagos. He insisted that the current constitution is perfect enough to move the nation forward. “Let us treat the disease and not the symptoms and let us agree first of all that no constitution in the world is perfect. What we have in Nigeria is representative democracy,” he said. The former President, who urged leaders to emulate Biblical qualitative leadership of Abraham, Joseph and Moses said there could not be quality leadership traits like that of our Lord Jesus Christ. Keynote Speaker, Vice Chancellor, University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said leaders should empathise and identify with the less privileged. Ighodalo said Nigeria had gone through a lot of problems and not yet what she is supposed to be. He, therefore, solicited leaders with vision that will move the country forward. Discussants include Founder/Senior Pastor, House on the Rock, Paul Adefarasin, National Overseer, The Redeemed Christian Church, Pastor Joseph Obayemi, Founder/Visioner, Arise Women Foundation, Dr. Siju Iluyomade, General Overseer, Foursquare Gospel Church in Nigeria, Rev. Samuel Aboyeji.
