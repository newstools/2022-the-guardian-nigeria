And by “heroes,” we are not referring to that expensive designer gown or those favourite jeans that hold sentimental value for you. We are talking about your casual clothes, the clothes that make you feel comfortable and free. The real OGs’ Gone are the days when casual clothing items like hoodies, tank tops, and tee-shirts were what you wore when at home or running a quick errand. Thanks to the evolving nature of the fashion industry and the introduction of the beloved street style genre, these casual clothes, when paired right, are now deemed stylish. To provide insight on how you can transform that “indoor” clothes into something everyone won’t stop staring at, here are tips that can help elevate your everyday casual wear into a fashion trendsetting outfit. Sweatshirts A staple in every lady’s wardrobe. Sweatshirts have been saving lives since their creation, and while they seem ideal for cozying up on the couch when the weather is cold, it is important never to underestimate the chic transformation of this casual wear. When worn with biker shorts and thigh-high boots, the sweatshirt demonstrates that it has it all: warmth and style.  Tank tops According to fashion experts, you can never go wrong with a tank top. Often regarded as a basic item, tank tops can easily be suited to meet the dress code of any occasion. For a picnic, it could be paired with a vintage shirt, and for a formal event like an office presentation, a blazer is sure to add that extra dose of confidence. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1727186 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-478x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1600" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-922x1152.jpg 922w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee-480x600.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mercy-Ekee.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Tee-shirts A word to accurately convey how stylish this casual wear can look is “jackets.” Whether it’s plain or printed, tee shirts go great with either a denim or leather jacket. And if you are not a jacket girl, a dungaree would do the trick. Hoodies Though hoodies are popularly known to give off a mysterious and effortlessly cool vibe, they are also quite versatile. There are various ways to style a hoodie beyond the cliche jeans or shorts. Opt for belts, beret, and mid-calf boots to make your hoodie glamour come true.  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1727175 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-543x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1409" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-543x598.jpg 543w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-1046x1152.jpg 1046w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-218x240.jpg 218w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-436x480.jpg 436w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m-545x600.jpg 545w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Athlesiure.-Photo-Joyleen_m.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Trackpants No stranger to the streets of fashion, tracksuits have evolved past sports events and are now making their way to becoming an “IT” fashion item. A tracksuit can be paired with a crop top to give it that “casual but yet sexy” vibe.
