Insist Buhari must resign over insecurity 
The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to reassess the way it prosecutes its war against insurgency and terrorism to avert circumstances that gave rise to delay in weapons procurement from Western countries. The group said, rather than blame Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese Matthew Hassan Kukah or NEF, the administration should ensure military operations satisfy basic standards demanded by weapons suppliers. Speaking in a television interview monitored in Abuja, yesterday, the Forum’s Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, faulted the Presidency over its response to sundry criticisms. Baba-Ahmed’s position came against the backdrop of the Presidency’s blame of the clergyman and opponents of the government. The Presidency had accused them of straining US-Nigeria relations, leading to delay in the supply of fighter jets to the country. NEF also reiterated its earlier call on Buhari to resign if he is unable to resolve the nation’s security problems.
