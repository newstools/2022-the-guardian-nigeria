Sir: For the 2023 presidency, I prefer any candidate with a kind heart; someone that can at least take a look at the plight of Talakawas, someone that can go through sleepless nights towards securing a solution to the predicament bedevilling us; and above all, I yearn to see a president, who is capable of securing our lives against the agents of doom topping national affairs. For now, religion, ethnicity or regionalism won’t work for me; 2015 suffice to be a lesson for me. I have toed this rough path of which to date I’m struggling to cope. The people I voted for at that time, are now the ones strangling us to death with I don’t care attitude and worthless/anti-masses policies. Then why wouldn’t I be wise one more step? Therefore, to this end, I can say, I have no qualms with any candidate that really looks fit to govern Nigeria effectively regardless of his religious or ethnic affiliation. A better hand is all I look on to, to paddle and sail us through the ocean of trauma, vicissitude and unprecedented calamities. However, the question of paying 100% solidarity, loyalty or whatever they call it to any political party should be out of our sight as we have now come to a point where the ones with discerning minds realise how devilish and perilous such mentality is. The APC sinking ship is a typical case study to illustrate the magnitude of our worthless idea of going for a single party. There are many rattling faces with workable brains out there in the other camps, so it’s our business to scrutinise beyond parties if we have to pinpoint people that would be the best for the positions we want to fill. Finally, may we have those who would love us prior to and after the poll, because, with such type of people at the helm of our affairs, we could be opportune to inhale the fragrance of good governance at all levels.
