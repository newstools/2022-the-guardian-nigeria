This is definitely not the best of times for a 57-year-old ex-policeman, Sunday Ige, who was retrenched as a corporal from the Nigeria Police Force in 2006 after a ghastly motor accident left him bedridden.
   
Not only was his leg amputated as a result of the accident, but he also suffered a spinal cord injury. Ige’s situation is compounded by the threat to evict him from his  Federal Ministry of Housing apartment in Akure, which was allocated to him in 1993, for his inability to offset the cost.
    
The disturbed ex-police officer, on Sunday, showed newsmen an eviction letter, he received from the Presidency in March 2022. He lamented that he was given two weeks ultimatum to vacate the property, which will expire this week.
  
According to him, the house, located at Shagari Estate, Akure, the Ondo State capital was allocated to him in 1993, but he was yet to fully pay the N1.250 million, he was asked to pay for the purchase, which expired in 2007.
