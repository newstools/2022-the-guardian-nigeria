President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday met behind closed doors with the Sokoto State governor, Hon. Aminu Tambuwal who visited the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Governor Tambuwal is one of the front runners for the opposition People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) presidential ticket for the forthcoming general election in the country. Governor Tambuwal’s meeting with President Buhari came a few days after the plans for a northern PDP’s consensus aspirant hit the rocks. He turned down overtures by newsmen to speak on the reason for his visit to the State House.
