With stiff competition from athletes like James Cecilia and Agbodoberi Victoria, former African Open silver and bronze medalist, Ewa-Enku Ekuta, says none in her weight category, -63kg, was confident yet of making it to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Ekuta is currently in camp opened on April 15 for training at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium Ibadan, Oyo State for final selection of judokas, who will represent the country at the Games scheduled to hold between July 28 and August 8. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Ekuta stated that she could not talk about her hope for medal when the federation was yet to decide, who makes it to Birmingham because of the level of competition among her rivals in camp, adding that the federation has not decided who will represent the country. “We have been in camp for seven days now. It has been rigorous training among judokas in camp and we have been coping. The camping is the decider of who will eventually make it. “I think this is a good one ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July. For now, no one is sure of who will be picked as we are still waiting for the list of judokas that will represent the country,” she said. The Nigeria Judo Federation extended invitations to Adeyanju Adebukola (-78kg), Asonye Joy (-70kg), Azeezat Adịjat (-70kg), Augustine Esther (-70kg), James Cecilia (-63kg), Ewa-Enku Ekuta (-63kg), Agbodoberi Victoria (-63kg), Terlumun Doose (-57kg) and Agu Blessing (-57kg) in the women category. In the men’s class are Cyprain Miracle (-90kg), Micah Frank Damini (-90kg), Murtala Fatai (-81kg), Ihaza Oluwatosin (-81kg), Ika-Bassey Nsa (-73kg), Kadijo Jonah (-73kg), Edwin Patrick (-66kg), Eniafe Solomon (-66kg) and Oyewole Samuel Rotimi (-73kg). Two coaches, Mr. Ihaza Edokpolor and Mrs. Christy Obekpa-Aremu, were invited to join the judokas in camp.
