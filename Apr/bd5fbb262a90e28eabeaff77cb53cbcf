A retired  Assistant Comptroller General of Nigeria Customs Service Bashir Abubakar has said that he would tackle the problem of insecurity in Kaduna State with his long experience in the paramilitary service if elected governor in 2023. Abubakar, who called on all other aspirants to step down for him, said if elected as governor, he would do a lot to protect the lives of Kaduna residents and fortify the state’s borders against criminals. Speaking at the Kaduna State Headquarters of the All Progressives Congress ( APC) where he declared his intention to vie for the Governorship of the state in 2023, Abubakar said he has over 30 years of experience in the Nigerian Customs where he held very sensitive positions and that would equip him to deal with the insecurity bedeviling Kaduna State once he is elected Governor. He explained that his intention to vie for the number one position in the state arose after a series of consultations with friends and associates who later, urged him to contest for the governorship so as to have a worthy successor to Governor El-Rufai in 2023. He said his track records as retired paramilitary personnel and subsequent commitments to the cause of humanity, were open for the public to see. Abubakar also vowed to empower women and the youth through skills acquisition. “The world over today, skills matters more than certificates. If you have first, second and third degrees without skills, after graduation, you will remain at home. With skills, you are not only employed, but you create jobs,” he said.
