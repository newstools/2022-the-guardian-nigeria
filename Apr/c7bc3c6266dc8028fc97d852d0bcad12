A chieftain of the Lagos State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Tokunbo Pearse, yesterday, explained why the party has never won the state’s gubernatorial election, saying it’s time the party positions itself to win in 2023.
  
Pearse, who stated this yesterday, during the endorsement of Lead Visioner of Lagos4Lagos, Dr. Abdul-Azeez Adediran, also known as Jandor, for the 2023 gubernatorial election, noted that it is time for the PDP to try someone that had been in the camp of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to ensure that the party wins. The party chieftain described former governorship aspirants under the PDP, Deji Doherty and Ade Dosunmu, as serial runners and losers, saying that they can never win the gubernatorial election.
    
He noted that the endorsement of Jandor would not derail the campaign of other aspirants, as they have all made great contributions to the party, saying that of all the qualified stalwarts of the party running for governor, Jandor is the most qualified one.
  
“I appeal to all delegates to join in endorsing him. Jandor has the financial capacity as PDP flagbearer and is able to attract multiple sources of funding and can raise funds within and outside the party,” he stated.
