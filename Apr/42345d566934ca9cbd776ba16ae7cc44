Barely two weeks after Youths Network for Nigeria Union (YNNU) urged former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest the 2023 presidency, the group has handed him a seven-day ultimatum to join the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and declare interest. The pro-Jonathan group, which turned up in its numbers at a rally in Suleja, Niger State, yesterday, warned that it would not vacate Jonathan’s office, if he fails to concede to its demand. Chairman of the group, Ibrahim A. Saiki, while addressing reporters at the rally said: “You may recall that on Friday, April 22, 2023, we led over 7,500 members of our network to ‘a private meeting’ with former President Jonathan, urging him to contest the 2023 presidential election. “While responding to our plea, former President Jonathan urged the youths of Nigeria to get more involved in politics and asked us to ‘watch out’ for his next move.” Saiki noted: “Since then, the media space has been awash with reactions to Jonathan’s comments, with several persons giving different interpretations. “To us in YNNU, what Nigeria needs at this period of our national life is a unifier. That unifier is President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.”
