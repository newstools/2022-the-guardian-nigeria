The International Olympics Committee (IOC) has captured eight Nigerian athletes in its scholarship scheme ahead of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Among the lucky athletes are 100 metres hurdler and reigning Commonwealth gold medallist, Oluwatobiloba Amusan and Tokyo Olympics bronze medallist, Ese Brume. Also on the scholarship list is Aruna Quadri, who has shot himself into reckoning as the first African Table Tennis player to play in the quarterfinals of the Olympics and recently became the first African player to reach the semifinal of the World Table Tennis Star Contender Championship in Qatar. Others are Imaobong Uko (Athletics) and Offiong Edem (Table Tennis). Under the scholarship scheme, athletes will receive a monthly payment until the Paris 2024 Olympics, which opens on July 26, 2024, and ends on August 11. Also on the list are two of Nigeria’s best women wrestlers, Olympics silver medallist, Blessing Oborodudu and freestyle sensation, Adekuruoye Odunayo, as well as Taekwondo star, Elizabeth Anyanacho. An overjoyed Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) Secretary-General, Banji Oladapo, said the scholarship is an indication that Team Nigeria’s light at Paris Olympics can glow brighter than expected. Oladapo noted that the scholarship included access to appropriate training facilities with coaches, who specialise in their respective disciplines, regular medical and scientific assistance, accident and illness insurance, pocket money and travel costs for the athletes’ participation in relevant competitions and qualification events. “We congratulate these eight athletes for earning scholarships as they focus on their qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympics. All these athletes need to do is to focus on their training and set their goal towards the Paris Olympics. The NOC is always ready to ensure that Nigerian athletes benefit from the IOC as their welfare remains our highest priority,” Oladapo said.
