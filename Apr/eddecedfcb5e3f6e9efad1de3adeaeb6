Two-Time commissioner in Enugu State, Dr. Eric Oluedo, has advised the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to stick to its rules in deciding who flies its flag in the 2023 elections to avoid implosion in the party. The PDP chieftain, who was reacting to the plethora of aspirants for elective offices in the state, also asked members not to see the contest as a do-or-die affair. Despite the subsisting zoning arrangement of the PDP in the state, no fewer than 50 persons from the three senatorial zones have obtained forms to contest the various elective offices in the state. On how the party could manage the interests and still remain united in the state, Oluedo stated that the zoning arrangement should be maintained. Speaking to reporters in Enugu after obtaining the PDP Expression of Interest and Nomination forms to contest the Awgu/Oji River/Aninri federal constituency seat in the 2023 general elections, he stated that the quantum of interest in the party arose because it has become a household name in the state. Oluedo, who was Head, Directorate of Visit Every Community (VEC) in Enugu, said he was prepared to attract projects that would add value to his constituents. According to him, it is the turn of Oji River  (Achi) to produce the next occupant to the position, stressing that Awgu held the position in the last 12 years. “Aninri is showing interest at the moment, but we are saying that they have held Senate seat up to the position of Deputy Senate President. That is a bigger position and we think that Oji River should be allowed. It is, however, the party that should have the final say and it won’t be a problem if the party sticks to rules,” he said.
