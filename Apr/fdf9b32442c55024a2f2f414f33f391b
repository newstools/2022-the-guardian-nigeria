The iftar dinner was held at the Sweet Valley School and Orphanage, built by the Africa Friendship Association in Bombo, located 35 km from Kampala, the capital of Uganda. The iftar dinner was attended by Mehmet Ali Altay, Deputy Attaché at the Turkish Embassy in Kampala; Ömer Aykon, TÄ°KA’s Coordinator in Uganda; and the officials of several institutions and organizations. In his speech, Ömer Aykon, TÄ°KA’s Coordinator in Uganda, said, “We will hold a series of events and iftar dinners in Uganda during the entire month of Ramadan. Today, we held our first event with orphans in Bombo. We broke our fast with them. As TÄ°KA, we make sure to meet with orphans, refugees, people with disabilities, and disadvantaged groups who were socially isolated by various means. We will continue to hold iftar dinners with disadvantaged groups in several regions this Ramadan.” Åemsettin Türkan, Chairman of the Africa Friendship Association, one of the stakeholders in this project, noted that they built a school, a primary health center, and a mosque in the complex, which was built on a land of 1,2 hectares. Mr. Türkan stated that they provided education for 300 orphans in the complex. He said, “While we had planned to hold the iftar dinner for 1000 people, a total of 1200 people attended the dinner. Invitees from neighboring villages met with orphans. We held a pleasant iftar dinner.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA).
