A legal luminary and political lieutenant of the late Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Chief Oladipo Jimilehin, yesterday said that part of Nigeria’s problem was the inability and unwillingness of leaders to rise up to their responsibilities. Jimilehin, who stated this at the public presentation of a book he authored, titled: “Nigeria, The Journey So Far to Democracy,” held in Lagos, said another factor that had contributed to Nigeria’s problems is tribalism. He lamented that Nigeria had deteriorated, saying: “It is one of the countries that give no value for money.” He added that Nigeria had been less than fortunate in its leadership, adding that a basic element of this misfortune is the seminal absence of intellectual rigour in the political thought of the founding-fathers. Jimilehin stated that in moving Nigeria forward, there is need to reflect on the uncommon unraveling destiny, which made Nigerians one in the restricted group of the most powerful men and women in the world.
