 Amber Heard | Image: JASIN BOLAND/WARNER BROS The defamation trial involving Johnny Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard has taken another turn as it appears that her life may be threatened. The Aqua man star has buffed up her security for protection based on alleged escalating threats and attacks from fans of Johnny Depp at the trial. The security team is made up of former military and government officials, who have their eyes set on Depps’s fans who are trying to access the Fairfax County Circuit Courthouse grounds. The security company have positioned personnel at the court premises and it is uncertain how many are working undercover to protect her. A memo released by the security team read, “Don’t be predictable or complacent.” According to the security firm, video images show observers running after the actress in her car while heading home. Fans have come hard on the 36-year-old actress since the defamation trial, and her legal team have also been subjected to threats online with the hashtag #JusticeForJohnnyDepp trended on Twitter as the Pirates of the Caribbean star was examined last week.
