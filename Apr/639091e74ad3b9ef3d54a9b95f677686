Sir: Leadership recruitment has become a key issue not only for corporate organisations around the world but also in countries and the election of their political leaders.

Many experts have agreed that it is the aggregate failure of leadership that has kept many countries backwards while others with good leaders march ahead to accomplish greatness to the benefit of their citizens. Often, Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Nelson Mandela are mentioned as examples of good leaders. Therefore recently there was jubilation in Enugu State when Ben Chika Ugwu declared his intention to contest for the Nsukka/Igboeze South Federal Constituency of the Nigerian House of Representatives in the 2023 elections under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The trending and exciting story by market women, students, tricycle riders, okada riders, youths, artisans, elders, clergy, professionals and people from all walks of life in the constituency is the hope that Ugwu’s candidacy brings as a breath of fresh air as the people demand a change in the current representation of the constituency. Okeagu Ndigbo as Ugwu is fondly called by his traditional title is a man with outstanding academic credentials, sterling leadership qualities, humane and philanthropic disposition, as he remains one of the most accessible personalities in his constituency. It is on record that he played key roles in his constituency to ensure the electoral victory of not only Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi but also Senator Ike Ekweremadu and other candidates in the past. In other words, he has been a good party loyalist, and political apprentice and the time for his settlement has come.  In his own words, ‘’Governance is like all other facets of leadership is not a tea party but a sacred responsibility with many dimensions. The dearth of visionary, committed and selfless political leadership in Nigeria has never been more glaring. With constricting national economy, excruciating poverty with palpable despair amid an avalanche of social and security woes, it is high time we projected only our very best to the position of leadership; men and women of wisdom, vast knowledge, discernment, clear conscience and sound discretion. We need a fresh vision, a new dynamic approach to governance. It’s the only way we can guarantee the future we earnestly yearn for ourselves and for our children.’’ As Dr Ben Chika Ugwu, the new face, voice and conscience of his beloved Nsukka/Igboeze South Federal Constituency of Enugu State begin his march to the National Assembly, one can only call on all stakeholders in the state to give him the necessary support he truly deserves.
