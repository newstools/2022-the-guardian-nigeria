The Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), New Era, yesterday, cautioned the National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and others against being an instrument of destabilisation in the hands of the oligarchs in Yorubaland. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Sina Akinpelu, gave the charge while speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan yesterday. Akinpelu said the purported support being given to the APC leaders of the Yoruba stock to contest for the Presidency was a ploy to bring about disunity in the South, using the South-West as the entry point. He said that the South-West is very strategic in the South, hence the focus on the region. The OPC leader said that  power should go to the South-East in 2023. “They are using politics to divide the West. They are bent on destroying South-West to destroy the South. They must remember that this is a bait to destroy their fatherland. From Tinubu to Osinbajo and others, they must not be a vessel for the destabilisation of the region.”
