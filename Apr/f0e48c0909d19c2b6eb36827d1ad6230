Imo State Basketball Association is partnering with some national team players to stage this year’s Owerri Classics, which will hold from April 20 to 24. It will feature teams from the South-South and South East zones of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). The four-day event, organised by Imo State Basketball Chairman, Kelechi Anosike and former Nigerian international, Kelechi Anuna and 14 others (active and retired players), will feature 15 teams from the zones. The second edition promises more excitements as the likes of former D’Tigress captain, Joyce Ekworomadu, serial Afrobasket winners, Ndidi Madu and Adaora Elonu will join Chukwudi Madubuam, Ike Diogu, Stan Okoye, Ekene Ibekwe, Ifunanya Ibekwe and Obi Emegano to ensure a successful four-day event. Speaking on the event, 2017 Afrobasket silver medallist, Anuna said, “The initiative is to provide hope and sense of belonging to South East and South-South youths. “After the last edition in December, I knew that we needed to bring more national team players back to support. We are fortunate that many wanted to support basketball in Nigeria,” he said. Anuna, who recently commissioned a basketball court in the state, said he was motivated to start the initiative after seeing sports stars going back to their communities to build courts and football pitches while growing up. “As I got older and saw the state of basketball facilities and infrastructure in the East compared to other regions in Nigeria, I knew I had to do something. Every time I come home, I see the same thing year after year. “Instead of waiting, I said the time is now which led to the recent basketball court renovation in Owerri where this competition will hold.” He assured basketball fans that there are more plans and developmental programmes in the pipeline to revive the sport in Imo State, South East and many other parts of Nigeria with the support of the Kelechi Anuna Foundation.
