A former Deputy National Vice Chairman (South-West) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Bode George, has warned the party against leaving its 2023 presidential ticket open for all members to contest. George said the PDP must make a definitive statement that it is zoning the presidency to the South in line with the constitution of the party. He also appealed to the National Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, to put the party on winning ways by correcting some pitfalls that could mar the party’s chances of winning the forthcoming 2023 general election or face imminent defeat. George, a permanent Board of Trustees member of the party, who spoke at the weekend in Lagos, pointed out that the PDP could not allow a crisis to fester in an election year in the two most viable electoral zones of the country, saying the party crisis in Lagos, Kano, Anambra and Abia states were politically ominous. He said the party’s congress conducted by the Chairman of the Electoral Committee for the Lagos State congress of PDP and Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, that produced the present executives in the state was botched and inconclusive, saying until the process is reversed, the party will be in disarray in the state.
