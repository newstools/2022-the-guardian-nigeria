• Invests Over $3b In Nigeria Since Inception For Nigeria to benefit more from the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) infrastructure investment projects across the continent, the government needs to provide credit enhancement guarantees that would help mobilise private capital in transportation and energy sectors.
 
Already, the institution has a current investment profile of $1.6 in Nigeria out of a balance sheet of $8.6 billion to bridge the country’s huge infrastructure deficit, a challenge that is often blamed for its poor economic performance and low job-creating capacity.
   
The AFC noted that it has extended over $3billion in credit facilities to Nigeria since inception. According to the President and Chief Executive Officer of AFC, Samaila Zubairu, because transport and energy sectors are areas that can easily attract private sector funding due to over 80 percent investment opportunity that exist in the sectors, government should invest less in the two sectors and provide investment enhancement in form of guarantee and safe mechanisms to woo private funding.  “AFC’s reach on the continent is now larger than it has ever been, with investments expanding to 35 countries and cumulative disbursements rising by 14% to $9.9 billion (2020: $8.7billion). The Executive Director and Head of Services, AFC, Sanjeed Gupta said lack of access to reliable power, inferior transport networks and poor telecommunications infrastructure are currently limiting economic growth and sector development, preventing millions of Africans from fulfilling their potential. 
   
He pointed out that by providing diverse solutions, risk capital and the expertise needed, AFC is helping to fill the continent’s infrastructure void and drive sustainable economic growth.
