The new remix of Ed Sheeran’s “2step” featuring Lil Baby was released on Thursday. The original song was released in Ed Sheeran’s fifth studio album last year. The music video showed British singer Sheeran singing among dancers on the streets of Kyiv as the music video of the “2step” remix was shot in the war-torn country before Russia’s invasion. Ed Sheeran is revealed in the video wearing a grey hoodie and black coat. All royalties and earnings for the single will support DEC’s Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. During a press statement, the ‘Shape of you’ singer said “I filmed the video for ‘2step’ in the city of Kyiv, Ukraine before the devastating acts of violence started to take place,” Sheeran said in a statement. “It was my first time visiting the country and I felt so welcomed during my stay there everyone from the production crew to the many people I met across my days off.” He added that “Ukraine is a proud and resilient country and I’m grateful to have had the chance to film my video there. I stand with Ukraine.” Sheeran had been suggestive about his collaboration with Lil Baby for some time where he wrote on his Instagram page “Been a big fan of @lilbaby for a while now, so excited to have him on the remix of this song and video. It’s an honour, hope everyone enjoys, April 22nd, few more surprises after that.” Ed Sheeran recently participated in a concert in March to raise money for war-torn Ukraine. Watch the video below
