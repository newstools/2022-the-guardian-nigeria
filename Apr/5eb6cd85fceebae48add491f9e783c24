Download logo The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Ms Nonhlanhla Ncube-Ndaba, has welcomed the arrest of six men in connection with the killing of elderly women in Cacadu’s Zingqolweni Village in the Eastern Cape.  Ms Ncube-Ndaba said: “The swift arrest of the alleged killers of the Zingqolweni Village’s old ladies is an exciting development and good news of hope for the defeat of the perpetrators of the scourge of gender-based violence (GBV).” She called for closer cooperation between all key role players, to ensure that the perpetrators of the gruesome killing of Zingqolweni Village’s senior citizens are brought to book. Furthermore, Ms Ncube-Ndaba called for the acceleration of the case and urged that the families of those killed are kept informed of all developments in the case. She also urged the Commission for Gender Equality to work together with other like-minded institutions to foster the fundamental rights of all citizens, including senior citizens. To this end, Ms Ncube-Ndaba indicated that the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities informed the committee of GBVF Local Rapid Response Teams in the Eastern Cape, which were formed to coordinate a multistakeholder response to GBVF in their areas. It is therefore imperative, she said, that all stakeholders work collaboratively in this regard. Ms Ncube-Ndaba also condemned the reported ongoing killing of women in Cacadu and across the country on accusations of witchcraft, and on any grounds, in the strongest terms. “We are calling on all peace-loving South Africans wherever this bad culture prevails to nip it in the bud. It is intolerable in our constitutional democracy,” emphasised Ms Ncube-Ndaba. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Republic of South Africa: The Parliament.
