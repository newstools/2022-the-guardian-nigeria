Sadio Mane vowed Liverpool will fight to win the quadruple after his brace sealed a 3-2 victory against Manchester City in the FA Cup semi-finals on Saturday. Liverpool is bidding to become the first English club to lift all four major trophies in a single season. Jurgen Klopp’s side has already won the League Cup and now they are through to a first FA Cup final appearance since 2012 thanks to Mane’s goals at Wembley. Ibrahima Konte headed Liverpool in front before Mane punished a mistake from City keeper Zack Steffen. The Senegal forward netted again before half-time and second-half strikes from Jack Grealish and Bernardo Silva weren’t enough for City. With Liverpool just one point behind Premier League leaders City with seven games left and facing a Champions League semi-final against Villarreal, Mane knows they could be on the verge of football immortality.

It’s a big win to win a semi-final and we are very happy to qualify for the final,” Mane said. “We started very well, we pressed them high and the goalkeeper made the mistake. I was very happy to score two goals but the performance of the team was fantastic. “Every Liverpool player enjoyed it because we did the right thing at the right time.”
