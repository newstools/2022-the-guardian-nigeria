By June 12, 2023, it would be clear 30 years after the memorable Presidential election that would have ushered in Chief Moshood Abiola as Nigeria’s President. Chief Abiola, who contested the poll on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), ran a well-oiled and well-received national campaign under the banner of Hope ’93. The theme song of that Presidential campaign was ‘On the march again!’  PLACED side by side with the happenings within the governing APC, particularly as older stakeholders are not determined yet on 2023, watchers of Southwest politics conclude that Soyinka’s diatribe could be a rich political metaphor to situate the diminishing appeal of APC in the zone.
  
Although Ige was very popular in Southwest politics, his beef with former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Chief Olu Falae, informed his decision to accept to work as Minister of Justice and AGF in President Olusegun Obasanjo’s first term.
  
It was speculated that his plan to quit Obasanjo’s government was informed by his aspiration to contest the 2003 Presidential poll on the platform of the Alliance for Democracy (AD) to make up for the loss of opportunity in 1999 when Falae became the consensus candidate for the AD/All Peoples Party (APP) accord.
