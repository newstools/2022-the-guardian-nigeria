Also, profit after tax (PAT) was up by 45 per cent year-on-year to N5.2 billion from N3.6 billion in 2021. Solid growth across all businesses supported this performance.

Net interest income also followed the same path as this grew by 33 per cent YoY to N28.1 billion from N21.2 billion for the first quarter of 2021. In addition, non-interest income rose to N9 billion at the end of March 2022 from N8.2 billion for the same period in 2021. Gross fees and commissions income increased 34 per cent YoY, driven by an increase in service fees and commissions while trading income also jumped by 63 per cent YoY resulting from higher volumes of fixed income instrument trades.
