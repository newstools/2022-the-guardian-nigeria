Aspirants jostling for elective offices in 2023 on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) will have to wait a little while to buy their Expression of Interest and Nomination forms. Sale of the forms was scheduled to begin on Saturday, but a visit to the party secretariat showed a delay in the commencement of the exercise. An authoritative source at the party secretariat told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that printers had not delivered the forms as at close of work on Friday. The source assured, however, that the sale of the forms would begin soon after they had been delivered to the secretariat and logistics fine-tuned. “The delay is because the contractor did not deliver the forms as at close of work on Friday, but may deliver before the weekend runs out. “If that happens, sale of forms could begin on Monday or Tuesday. “The party’s National Working Committee will determine the new date,’’ the source said. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Felix Morka, did not respond to messages put across to him.
