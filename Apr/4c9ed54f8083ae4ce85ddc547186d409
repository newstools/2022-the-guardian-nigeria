The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has commiserated with the Nigeria Referees Association and the immediate family of former FIFA referee, Festus Bolaji Okubule, who died in Lagos on Tuesday evening at the age of 80.
 
Okubule, who was the second Nigerian referee to officiate at the Africa Cup of Nations after Sunny Woghiren in 1974, was nicknamed ‘Showboy’ for his demonstrative stance on the pitch and his immaculate dressing. He refereed at the 1986 Africa Cup of Nations hosted by Egypt.
