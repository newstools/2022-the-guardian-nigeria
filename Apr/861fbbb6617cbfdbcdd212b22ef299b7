Hails senator’s contribution to democracy The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Enugu State chapter, has debunked claims that Senator Chukwuka Utazi (Enugu North) was denied the right to purchase the Expression of Interest and Nomination forms for Senate seat, for allegedly insulting the State Vice Chairman (West) of the party, Dr. Okey Ozoani. In a statement, yesterday by its Publicity Secretary, Chief Jude Ugwu, the party described the claims as “spurious and ridiculous,” adding that they were “the handiwork of few traducers notorious for their street-level mendacities.” “Those pandering to these mischievous spins are unnecessarily muddying the waters. “Senator Utazi is one of the shining examples of Enugu’s contribution to the red chamber and has religiously contributed to the success of PDP from inception. Enugu PDP is, therefore, proudly associated with the senator for his robust, enviable and indelible contributions towards the sustenance of our democracy,” the statement stressed. Urging members of the public to ignore the baseless, unfounded and vexatious claims, the party enjoined its teeming faithful and the general public to note that “such outlandish and unsubstantiated news is fake and ridiculous.”
