The ceremony which took place on Monday had in attendance Khaled’s wife Nicole and their two sons, Asahd and Aalam, as Khaled was cemented into Hollywood history. Khaled was also flanked by the music industry’s finest, showing support with artists like Jay-Z and Diddy, Fat Joe, Teyana Taylor, Jeezy Cool, Dre and N.O.R.E. in attendance. Fat Joe said of Khaled’s win “When I think of Khaled, I think of love,” he told the crowd on Hollywood Blvd. In hip-hop for a long time, we haven’t really embraced fatherhood. Nobody has done it like Khaled. Music-wise, there’s nobody with a greater ear.” Diddy also added, “Khaled means forever and I want to congratulate you on something that will be here forever to mark the great work that you’ve done.”
The induction into the Hollywood Walk Of Fame recognises DJ Khaled’s accomplishment as a disc jockey.
The 46-year old and CEO of We The Best has a new collaboration with Jordan Brand for a clothing line and four different Air Jordan 5 colourways. DJ Khaled thanked all in attendance saying “I want my star to represent the light, the love that shines on everybody. God put me on this earth to be a light. The room could be pitch dark and when I walk in, it’s bright. This is for hip-hop. But I want to make it clear, we just getting started.”
