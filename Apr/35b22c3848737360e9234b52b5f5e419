Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Transportation, Oluwatoyin Fayinka, has said that checkpoints at Apapa and Tin Can axis have been assigned to specific agencies as part of the state government’s effort to eliminate gridlock and curb illegal extortion. Speaking at a stakeholder meeting with transport unions, Fayinka said the state government had reached an agreement with the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA) to streamline checkpoints along the corridor and feeder routes. Fayinka also explained that in doing that, illegal extortion points would be disbanded. He explained that some checkpoints would be manned by the NPA alone while others would be assigned to the NPA and the Lagos State Government. In the same vein, the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) will manage some points independently without interference from other agencies. The special adviser promised that the state government would enforce zero tolerance on illegal extortions and activities of miscreants along the corridor through special mobile courts. He said the agencies charged with the role of managing traffic flow along the axis have been clearly defined and assigned to prevent any illegal activity that would hinder smooth port operations. The Transport Special Adviser further stated that trucks would no longer be stopped for ETO at Ijora Badia (LPC axis), Mile 2 under and over the bridge and UBA (TCIPC corridor). He added that truck movement would not be interfered with at NAGAFF, Area B, RRS Marine Bridge, 7up, Fidelity Roundabout, Etisalat Roundabout (LPC axis) and RRS (TCIPC corridor).
