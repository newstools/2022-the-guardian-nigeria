It is not out of place to see a pregnant woman in a long flowing dress, loose pants and tops. The easier it is, the better right? With the deliberate focus on maternity styles and how to be chic with a belly, maternity style has reinvented itself such that body con dresses and stilettos are now go-to items. When musician and fashion mogul, Rihanna stepped out with her maternity style, pregnant and sexy bagged a new look. Rihanna’s baby bump style set off with a vintage hot pink Chanel puffer coat, complete with floor-grazing jeans and multicoloured bejewelled chains that draped over her bare stomach. She is most certainly giving off a new definition of maternity styles. She once said in an interview, “Fashion is one of my favourite things, so, you know, we’re defying what it even means to be pregnant and maternal. It can get uncomfortable at times and so you can dress the part and pretend.” In true fashion, at the Dior fashion week, the mom-to-be wore knee-high black boots, with her neck and décolletage encircled in layered necklaces with her baby bump in full display. Stylist and fashion consultant, Solange Franklin applauding this trend said, “Rihanna is setting pregnancy style ablaze, presenting a bold vision for mothers-to-be. It’s not hiding. It’s not accommodating. It’s more of an effusive energy… an unabashed and abundant beauty”. It is safe to say that with Rihanna, we are in a masterclass on how to be pregnant and fashionable.
