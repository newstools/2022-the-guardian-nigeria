However, this skin condition is natural and could be caused by several reasons, including accumulation of dead skin cells, shaving and sweating. Rather than be dismayed, there are helpful tips for lightening your underarms. These are seven natural remedies for getting rid of dark underarms: A proven cure for dark underarms, tea tree oil performs two functions, lightening dark underarms and keeping them odour-free. Tea tree oil also contains anti-microbial properties that keep the underarms free from bad odour. To apply, mix some tea tree oil with water in a spray bottle and spray. Repeat this process multiple times for effective results. A well known natural bleaching agent, lemon juice contains a high concentration of citric acid that removes dead skin cells from the underarms, lightening it over a period of time. Cut lemon slices, gently scrub your underarms with them, and leave on for up to 10 minutes before rinsing off with cold water. Repeat this process up to three times weekly. Aloe vera is well known for its antibacterial properties that help soothe and lighten the skin. Take a fresh leaf of aloe vera, cut and extract the gel. Massage the aloe vera gel onto your underarms and leave to dry for up to 20 minutes, then rinse off with lukewarm water. Aloe vera gel can be substituted with aloe vera gel; repeat this process multiple times. Easily found in the kitchen, apple vinegar cider help with lightening dark underarms. Loaded with amino and lactic acids, this natural remedy helps remove dead skin cells. It also contains astringent properties that unclog the pores smoothing the armpit area. Dilute apple vinegar cider with water. Soak a cotton ball in it and dab gently over your armpit area, leaving for up to 10 minutes, then rinse off with lukewarm water. Continuing both skin healing and skin lightening properties, turmeric also contains antibacterial ingredients, which brighten your underarms and reduces itching. Mix turmeric, honey and milk in a small boll and apply to the underarm area. Leave on for 15 minutes, then rinse off. Also found in the kitchen, potatoes brighten the skin, reducing patching and itching. Its mild citric acid also makes it best suited for everyone, including those with sensitive skin. Grate and extract the potato juice and apply it directly to your underarms with a cotton ball. Rinse after 10 minutes with cool water. A few cool cucumber slices rubbed directly on your underarm, and you can say goodbye to dark underarms.
