 Cuba Goodling Cuba Gooding Jr. has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour count of forcibly touching a woman at a New York nightclub in 2018 which makes him avoid a jail term. The agreement with prosecutors stipulates that if the Oscar-winning actor continues to undergo court-ordered counselling for six months, he can then withdraw his misdemeanour plea and plead guilty to a lesser violation of harassment. The actor had been accused of violating three different women at various Manhattan nightspots in 2018 and 2019 and faces up to a one-year jail term if he fails to comply with the agreement made with the prosecutor. if he does not comply, the 54-year old faces up to one year in jail. The Manhattan district attorney’s office said that Gooding admitted to subjecting two other women to “non-consensual physical contact” in 2018 and 2019, which came three years after he was arrested. The count charged him with forcibly kissing a woman at a nightclub in September 2018.
Gooding also noted, “I apologise for making anybody feel inappropriately touched.” Minutes after the plea, a Manhattan federal judge rejected Gooding’s bid to dismiss a $6 million civil lawsuit by a woman allegedly saying that Gooding raped her twice in 2013 at the Mercer Hotel in Manhattan’s SoHo district but Gooding denies her claims. U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty said the woman didn’t take too long to sue by waiting until 2020 to invoke a New York City law protecting victims of gender-motivated violence. Cuba Gooding Jr. earned an Academy Award for best-supporting actor in the 1996 romantic comedy “Jerry Maguire” playing the role of a tense football player.
