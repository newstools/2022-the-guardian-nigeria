Tunde said medical attention was given to them, but they were not given proper treatment because no medical doctor was available at the hospital. “Those that were seriously injured were taken to the General Hospital in Badagry for proper attention. “Since my injury is not much, I decided to take care of myself,” he said. Also speaking, Chief Thoma Agodi, the Baale of Iragbo community, said he was inside his palace when a resident came to inform
him that the church building had collapsed. “We have to thank God that there is no fatality as a result of the collapse,” he said.
