Former Super Eagles Coach, Christian Chukwu, has urged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to stop lamenting over the country’s failure to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup and begin preparations immediately for the fast-approaching Cote d’Ivoire 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series. According to Chukwu, one of the ways to ensure that Nigeria’s bid to qualify for Cote d’Ivoire 2023 does not suffer the same fate as the World Cup games is by appointing, immediately, a suitably qualified coach to start preparing the team for the challenges ahead. He said the AFCON qualifiers and friendly games against tested teams would help the new coach to study his players and build a team of his taste. “A coach should be appointed to take charge and start building a solid team by playing friendly games with teams that have qualified for the World Cup. This will enable the coach to access more players from Nigeria and abroad to make up his main team. “ The coach that will be appointed, foreign or local, must be ready to live in Nigeria, discover and groom players from the league and open doors for stiff competition for shirts in the Eagles team. “The Super Eagles can be great again with proper management. Delaying the appointment of a coach is dangerous now,” he said.
