The continued presence of eggs in the human diet is largely linked to them being a major source of protein, calcium, and several vitamins and nutrients. Asides from that, eggs have a higher shelf life and offer a larger culinary variety, including hard-boiled eggs, omelettes, and devilled eggs, to mention a few. Still, wondering why you need to include this fantastic protein in your diet? Here are five health benefits of eating eggs daily: A single large egg contains up to 70 calories, 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat and 0 grams of carbs. The yolk, the most important part of the egg, is the source of nutrients like vitamin B12, vitamin D and choline. These nutrients help the body process food into energy, and the combination of protein and healthy fat gives eggs some staying power allowing you to feel full for longer. Eggs are a primary source of different B vitamins, such as vitamins B2, B5 and B12. These nutrients each perform different functions in the body, including maintaining healthy skin and hair. Since B vitamins are water-soluble, they aren’t stored up in the body for long, so you have to eat them regularly to meet your dietary needs. Eggs are also very rich in amino acids (protein building blocks) like methionine that improve skin tone and strengthen your hair and nails. Eggs contain the micronutrient choline, which is vital for creating cell membranes and essential neurotransmitters in the body. Choline helps with memory, mood, muscle control and general nervous system function, and consuming little or almost none may limit your neuro function. Egg yolks contain two carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which are important for eye health: these carotenoids aid eye development and healthy vision. They have also been proven to lower the risk of common age-related eye diseases. Vitamin D contains several health benefits, the more important being its role in maintaining healthy bones. Eggs contain vitamin D, which improves calcium absorption in the gut and keep calcium and phosphorus levels in a range to promote healthy bone growth and bone remodelling. Affordable and super-nutritious, eggs are packed with protein, vitamins and nutrients that provide the body with tremendous health benefits.
