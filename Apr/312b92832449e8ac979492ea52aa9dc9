Thomas Partey has joined a list of Arsenal players who are likely to miss tomorrow’s match against Brighton due to injury, reports www.sussexlive.co.uk. The midfielder came off in the Gunners’ 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday night with a suspected thigh problem. Mikel Arteta confirmed earlier this week that left-back, Kieran Tierney, has a knee injury that could rule him out for the season and right-back Takehiro Tomiyasu is still sidelined with a calf problem. Now, Arsenal has said Partey sustained damage to his right thigh against the Eagles. It appears he will miss this weekend’s game, and potentially their matches against Southampton and Chelsea as well. A club statement reads: “Our No.5 was substituted during Monday night’s game against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park after aggravating his right thigh. “Thomas has since received further assessments and a subsequent scan has shown muscle damage to his right thigh. We will continue to assess Thomas in the coming weeks, during which time he will also receive further specialist consultations. “Everyone will be working hard to get Thomas back on the pitch as soon as possible.” Arsenal’s record with Partey is much better than when he is unavailable. This season, the Gunners average two points a game when he plays and has a win percentage of 65.2. In the six games without the 28-year-old, their win percentage is 33.3 and they average 1.2 points per match.
