Collin Morikawa is employing an interesting strategy on Day 1 at the Zurich Classic at New Orleans. The strategy being, “Let’s try to put the ball in the hole without using a putter,” reports golfdigest.com. And through the first nine holes it was a strategy that paid dividends. Paired with Viktor Hovland in the tour’s only team-centric event, Morikawa provided his first highlight at TPC Louisiana’s 13th hole (the young guns started their round on the back nine), making his approach from just under 100 yards disappear for eagle. Which, while impressive, is not necessarily that surprising; Morikawa led the tour in SG/approach last season and ranks inside the top 10 this year. The man has a habit of working magic with his irons.

Morikawa and Hovland were the favorites entering the week, with the belief that the only thing holding the supergroup back could be their putting. Looks like Morikawa has figured out a work-around.
