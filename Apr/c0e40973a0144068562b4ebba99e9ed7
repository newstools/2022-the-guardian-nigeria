Kebbi State Government has commended the Federal Government on the reopening of Kamba Border and expressed support for the Nigeria Customs Service Area Command in the state in the discharge of its statutory functions. Kebbi  Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, expressed his delight during a sensitisation programme organised by NCS. Represented by the State Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Garba Geza, the governor expressed optimism that the reopening of the border would impact positively on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and youths who stand to benefit most from the border reopening. The Customs Area Controller of Kebbi Command, Comptroller Joseph Attah, told stakeholders and indigenes of Kamba that the reopening of the border presents an opportunity for legitimate business activities across the border. He said the border reopening was not an invitation to illegitimate trade and not permitted for the importation of every manner of goods, especially those that could compromise national security but to allow trade that could improve the economy and impact positively on people. Attah said that his officers and men were ready to facilitate legitimate trade and do all within the ambit of the law to make trade across Kamba Border seamless as long as stakeholders import what is allowed by the law, make a proper declaration and pay appropriate duties to the Federal Government coffers. He took the time to explain the import and clearance procedure to the audience, emphasizing the need for strict compliance. The District Head of Kamba, Mahmuda Fana, commended the Federal Government for the development noting that the reopening would boost the economic activities of the border town and the nation at large. The sensitisation programme had in attendance the representatives of all relevant units at the border as well as representatives from the Niger Republic.
