President Muhammadu Buhari has signed Executive Order 11 on maintenance of national public buildings. Buhari signed the document, yesterday, before commencement of the cabinet meeting, holding at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja. Speaking shortly before signing, he directed all Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government (MDAs) to set up maintenance departments, in line with provisions of the new Order. He said the Order now gives legal backing to the country’s national maintenance policy, following its earlier approval by the Federal Executive Council. He said government had already started utilising the policy to give facelift to some of its buildings, like the federal secretariat, Abuja, and 24 others spread across the country. He said: “The office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation has approved the establishment of a department of federal public assets maintenance as a vital step in support of the implementation of this national policy, which is unprecedented in our history and approach to maintenance.” “In order to ensure the fullest implementation and impact of the policy, it is my pleasure to sign this Executive Order that ties maintenance direct to our economy. “By this Order, I expect MDAs to set out and ensure the operation of their maintenance departments and make necessary procurements for their maintenance in accordance with the provisions of the Public Procurement Act.”
