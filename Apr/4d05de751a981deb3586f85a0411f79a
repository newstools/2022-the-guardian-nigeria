Starling Jenkins, a member of Depp’s security team, testified about the faeces in the trial between Heard and Depp.
According to Jenkins, the actress defecated on the bed she shared with Depp. In his testimony, Jenkins also testified that the actress on April 21, 2016, hit and cursed Depp for being late for her 30th birthday dinner after he was held up at a meeting discussing his poor finance. The security guard confirmed that this happened after the two were involved in a heated argument that made Johnny Depp leave the house. The next morning after Heard had gone on her Coachella trip, the housekeeper found faeces on the bed of the couple.
Speaking about this in court, Depp says, “My initial response to that was, I laughed,” Depp said in his testimony while describing his reaction when he saw a photo of the faeces. He added, “It was so outside, it was so bizarre and so grotesque that I could only laugh.” Depp is suing ex-wife Heard, for allegedly defaming him when she wrote an article for the Washington Post that described him being abusive to her in their marriage.
