Presidential hopeful on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), Stanley Osifo, yesterday, identified insecurity and poverty as the bane of the country’s growth and development. He equally expressed worry over the situation in the country, pledging to reorganise the nation’s security architecture for better service delivery and operational efficiency towards tackling the challenge head on. Addressing leaders of APC and the party faithful at its secretariat in Benin City, Osifo said the insecurity and economic challenges bedeviling the country prompted him to join the race to contest for the number one office in the country to save the situation. He said the country needs educated and experienced men with capacity to deliver on their mandate, particularly on the need to address issues of insecurity, poverty and inequality, among others, plaguing the nation. Osifo, who hails from Ovia North Council in Edo State, declared his readiness to take the country to an enviable height if given the opportunity by ensuring wealth creation, youth empowerment and development of all parts of the country. Receiving the aspirant, the APC state Chairman, Col. David Imuse (rtd) informed him of the need to purchase party’s nomination form as the first step in indicating his interest to run for presidency.
