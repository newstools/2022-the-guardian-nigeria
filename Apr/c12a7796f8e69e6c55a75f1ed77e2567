Ohaneze Ndigbo has described politicians whose election forms are purchased by other people as tricksters. Obiozor  The group said such a ‘dramatic’ increase in the purchase of presidential nomination forms for the 2023 election could be a subterfuge. “Nigeria has the right to prevail over egotistical leaders, with the signing of the new electoral law, hope for credible elections and a transparent transition process. It is time for massive voter registration by Nigerians, especially Ndigbo.” “We are bestowed with the obligations to update our people scattered across the 774 local councils in the country that there is fresh hope of their votes counting in 2023. We are aware of the loss of interest in the elections since 1999, and corrupt politicians had capitalised on the apathy of Nigerians to impose unpopular and corrupt politicians on Nigerians, in connivance with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agents. Igbos should get their PVCs ready and chase away hypocrites and impostors in power,” the statement read in part. The group noted that Igbo candidates won two federal and House of Assembly seats in Lagos in 2011, regretting that with the loopholes in the electoral process, there was coercion and oppression against Ndigbo in Lagos in 2015 and 2019 elections. It added: “The scenario will be different in 2023. We are excited to inform Ndigbo to stop the boycott and participate in the 2023 election in every ward they found themselves across the country. We have the numerical strength to push for a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023. We will get it right now, but it starts with the registration of voters. “Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) members should get their own for elections and future referendum.”
