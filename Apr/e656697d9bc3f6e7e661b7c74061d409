Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Kano, Usman Alhaji, has charged civil servants in the state to work hard towards attaining the pinnacle of their careers for societal and personal glory. Alhaji, who is Wazirin Gaya, stated this in his office while bidding farewell to the Permanent Secretary, Council Affairs Directorate, Government House, Kano, Binta Salihu, who recently retired from service. This was disclosed to The Guardian, yesterday, by the Press Secretary, Cabinet Office, Musa Muhammad. The dream of any civil servant, according to him, is to retire as a permanent secretary, which could be attained only through selfless service, patience and hard work. He added that “the apex position in the civil service is only attainable by a very few” and should be considered a divine gift and honour to facilitate one’s quest to serve humanity.
 
Extolling the retiree for having dealt and interacted with different calibre of people over a considerable length of time, the SSG charged her to use her wealth of experience for the development of the state’s civil service and the state in general. Also, the Permanent Secretary, REPA, Bilkisu Memota said the retiree would always be remembered for her simplicity, friendliness and, above all, her fear of God in her dealings and wished her well in her future endeavours. Responding, Salihu thanked God for the opportunity to reach the peak of her career, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for the confidence reposed in her to serve, the governor’s wife for her motherly care and the SSG for his mentorship, praying God to reward them abundantly.
