Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said he is not ready to negotiate the presidential ticket for any other position as he also jettisons consensus. He stated this, yesterday, in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State during his visit to consult with the state Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on his intention to run for the position of President. While telling party members that he has the capacity to run for the presidential position, Wike accused those calling for a consensus candidate of hiding the truth from Nigeria. He said: “I want to make myself available for the people of Cross River that I will run for the president of Nigeria. I do not want to be recognised as a former presidential candidate. I am going to run and get the ticket, I am not running to negotiate for anything to be the vice president but I am running to be the President of Nigeria.
   
“I am not a party to consensus, what I do not like is deceiving people. If you want us to do consensus, tell us the truth, everybody knows about consensus. Some people talk of consensus; I am not here for that rubbish. “If you want to run for election, come out and run. I told them I am not a party to consensus. If you want to win the election, you need someone with capacity and energy, I am the one that has the capacity and energy, give me the ticket.” Former state governors, Liyel imoke and Donald Duke, thanked Wike for giving Cross River his support when the party was in dire need of it. They assured him of the party members support in the race of being the next President. Describing Wike as a man that has the capacity to rule the country, Senators Gershom Bassey and Sandy Onor also assured him of their support.
