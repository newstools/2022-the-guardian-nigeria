President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, in Abuja, urged Nigerians to resist agents bent on causing breakdown of law and order in the country, assuring that no individual or group will be allowed to destabilise the country. ‘’We have the land, we have the resources, and we have the people. But I do not know why people will allow themselves to be successfully subverted to destabilise their own country,’’ the President said at an Iftar dinner with governors, ministers and heads of government agencies. Buhari, who thanked the governors and ministers for honouring his invitation to break the Ramadan fast, expressed confidence that, in spite of the current security challenges, the country will succeed.
