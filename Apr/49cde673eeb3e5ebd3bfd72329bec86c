As part of events marking the celebration of International Table Tennis Day, residents of IDPs (Internally displaced Persons) Camp Uhogua, Edo State, were presented with table tennis equipment that was donated to them by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) on April 6, 2022. The donated table tennis equipment includes canvass shoes, table tennis balls, table tennis rackets and T-shirts.
The National Coordinator of CSED Initiative, Edema Fuludu, presented the donated items to some of the selected male and female residents of the IDPs Camp, who before now, had access to one hand crafted table tennis board. At this event, Fuludu formally handed over three new hand crafted table tennis board that was donated by CSED Initiative to the Management of the camp. Two of the new table tennis boards will be used by female students/resident of the camp, while the boys will use the other one in order to develop their table tennis skills. Receiving the donated items, Pastor Evelyn Ekhator, on behalf of the Management staff of the IDPs Camp Uhogua, commended the ITTF for extending the benefit of “Table Tennis United” to their rural part of Benin City. Pastor Ekhator assured the ITTF and CSED Initiative that the donated table tennis equipment would be properly utilised by the children and youths of the camp. It would be recall that in 2018, CSED Initiative donated a table tennis board to residents of the camp, but it got damaged due to being over-used. Though CSED Initiative is an NGO partner of the NTTF (Nigeria Table Tennis Federation), lack of fund has prevented them from implementing their grassroots table tennis programme. Now that they have been able to commission durable handcrafted table tennis boards, CSED intends to launch their grassroots table tennis programme in Edo and Delta States in 2023. An important part of CSED grassroots table tennis programme is the training of P.E. Teachers, who will in turn, impart their knowledge on their students.
