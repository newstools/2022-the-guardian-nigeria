The African Table Tennis Federation (ATTF) has picked Lagos as a venue for the World Championships regional qualification, African Cup and African Club Championships. The championships are scheduled to hold between May 19 and 28 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall of Teslim Balogun Stadium. Qualification for the World Championships regional qualification for West Africa is slated for May 19 to 21, while the African Club Championships will hold between May 23 and 25. The African Cup, which is a singles tournament, will climax the event between May 26 and 28. Speaking at the event, ATTF President, Khaled El-Salhy, said the choice of Lagos was centred on the remarkable organisation of earlier tournaments, coupled with the encouraging remarks from players, coaches, and the participating teams. “Lagos has the best bid to host the African Cup in 2022 together with the African Clubs, as ATTF is always satisfied with the remarkable organisation in Lagos, coupled with full capacity of spectators in the venue throughout any major competition,” he said. The ATTF boss said the African Cup would now be a continental qualification for WTT Cup Finals. “The new thing is that the ITTF World Cup may not be held this year and the other option will be the WTT Cup Finals which will include the same policy that continental cup winners will represent each continent,” he added. Meanwhile, a nine-man Main Organising Committee (MOC) has been approved by the ATTF with Wahid Oshodi chairing the committee. President of Cote d’Ivoire Table Tennis Federation, Prof. Alfred Germain Karou, will deputise for Oshodi in the MOC. Other members include the Chairman of Lagos State Sports Commission (LSSC), Sola Aiyepeku, Dr. Adesoji Tayo, Kweku Tandoh and Mokhtar Toukabri of Tunisia.
