I never saw it as my final destination.” He added, “I never want this show to overstay its welcome in any way. I always want to love making it. And I think in a year from now, that will be a good time to move on and see what else might be out there.” Corden further said that he wants the next season to be the best year of the show as he goes out with a bang.
