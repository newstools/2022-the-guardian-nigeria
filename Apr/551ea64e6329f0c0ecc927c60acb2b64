The 12-song album produced by Kanye West and Pharrell Williams also includes contributions from Jay-Z, Kid Cudi, Lil Uzi Vert, Don Toliver, Nigo, Labrinth, and Pusha T’s brother and Clipse bandmate No Malice. Below, listen to It’s Almost Dry and find the album’s full credits. Ahead of the album’s release, Pusha T was the musical guest on The Tonight Show, Starring Jimmy Fallon. It’s Almost Dry is a follow-up to Pusha T’s 2018 album Daytona. He had earlier released singles Diet Coke, Hear Me Clearly and Neck & Wrist off the album. Last week, Kid Cudi addressed his contribution to It’s Almost Dry, making it clear that while he worked on the song with Kanye West, it didn’t mean they were cool. “I did this song a year ago when I was still cool w Kanye,” Cudi tweeted, referring to “Rock N Roll.” “I am not cool w that man. He’s not my friend and I only cleared the song for Pusha cuz thats my guy. This is the last song u will hear me on w Kanye.”
