Mountain of Fire Ministries Football Club (MFM FC) coach, Ikechukwu Christian, foresees a fierce battle between his team and their hosts, Plateau United in today’s fixture slated for the New Jos Stadium, Jos. The encounter, a Nigeria Professional Football League Matchday 23 fixture, is a battle for the league title on the part of the Peace Boys, while the Olukoya Boys are struggling to escape from relegation waters. Having both played 22 matches, Plateau United are second on the log after securing 14 wins, drew three games and losing five fixtures, while MFM FC, which amassed only 23 points, have won six games, drew five and lost 11 to sit 18th on the log. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, coach Christian said that regardless of the opponent’s position on the league table, his team was ready to make their away record count in today’s epic clash. “We are definitely going to take the match as a normal league fixture and we are going to approach it just as we did in every other game. Since we came on board, out of six away matches, we have been able to pick at least four points from our host teams. We are still learning from these feats and we are not resting on our oars. “Plateau United is aiming for a continental ticket, while we are still battling to escape relegation. It is definitely going to be a huge clash for both teams and we are not leaving any stone unturned. We have to give it our best as we have been doing in the past matches,” he said. Ikechukwu added: “Plateau United is currently one of the strongest teams in the NPFL at the moment as far as the table records are concerned. Tomorrow’s game is like a case of a top dog against an underdog. But I can tell you that anything can happen in football. We are hopeful of coming out with a good result at the end of 90 minutes,” he stated.
