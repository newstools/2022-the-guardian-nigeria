Presidential aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Obi, has said he is not desperate to be president bur desperate to make Nigeria work. The two-time governor of Anambra State and vice presidential candidate of the PDP in 2019 stated this, yesterday, when he paid a courtesy visit to Governor Douye Diri at the Bayelsa State Government House in Yenagoa. Obi said Nigeria was a great country with untapped potential, noting that he was desperate to move the nation away from a consumption economy to a productive one. He stressed that Nigeria was not working because of its unproductive state, which, he said, was unacceptable to the nation’s young, intelligent and smart population. Obi asserted that if elected Nigeria’s president, he would end the current oil revenue sharing formula and introduce a production formula, particularly in agriculture and ICT. He said the $18bn Nigeria oil monthly income could not be compared to Facebook or Twitter, which was just sold for $44bn. “I am aspiring to lead this country. For me, it is not a desperate aspiration but I am desperate to see Nigeria work. “This is a great country and I have a simple thing to do. I want to move it from consumption to a productive country. It is not working because it is not a productive country,” he said. In his remarks, Diri said Obi proved his worth, while he served as governor of Anambra, especially when he saved and handed over N75bn to his successor. Diri said Nigeria needed well-equipped and knowledgeable people like Obi to rescue the country from those who have failed to fix it.
