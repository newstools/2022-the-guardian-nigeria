However, due to a variety of factors like sun damage, ageing, and lifestyle changes among others, our skin encounters dullness and pigmentation. One of the best ways to take care of your skin is through professional facial treatments. With a professional facial treatment, you can tighten saggy skin, soften skin texture, improve skin elasticity, fight hyperpigmentation and reduce wrinkles and fine lines on your face. Getting a facial treatment is a great way to improve your look without resorting to plastic surgery. Below are the types of facials you can get to rejuvenate your skin and fade blemishes: Brightening Facial A brightening facial specifically targets areas of hyperpigmentation on our skin. It also helps to even out our skin tone. A brightening facial uses powerful ingredients like Vitamin C which improves skin texture while boosting radiance. It is definitely one of the must check out facials if you suffer from hyperpigmentation or dull skin. Microdermabrasion This facial is ideal for anyone looking to remove age spots and acne scarring. A microdermabrasion facial buffs away the top layers of your skin. It brushes off dead skin cells and, as a result, improves cell turnover and promotes elastin growth and collagen production. A microdermabrasion facial reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, blemishes, age spots, blackheads and enlarged pores, just to name a few. It is important to avoid direct sunlight exposure for a few hours after getting this facial treatment. Laser Skin Resurfacing A laser skin resurfacing facial tightens the skin using infrared light. This procedure removes the outer layers of the skin and stimulates the production of collagen and new cells. It is also used to reduce the appearance of wrinkles and lines on the face and neck. Visopeel Glycolic Facial Visopeel Glycolic Facial has been praised for improving skin appearance. Visopeel glycolic facial combines Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) and Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHAs) to provide a clearer, fresher looking skin by removing dead skin cells through exfoliation. The ingredients penetrate and deliver anti-oxidants and vitamins into the skin, promoting new cells to grow stronger and healthier. This treatment combats acne and oily skin. If you want youthful and radiant skin, you’ll love this facial treatment. Mixed fruits with apple banana orange and other on wooden background – Healthy food style Fruit Facial Treatment A fruit facial is one of the best types of facial for your skin. AHA acids, which are derived from fruits, can help in gently removing dead cells and giving radiant skin. For example, lemon brightens while malic acid in apples is a great exfoliator. A fruit facial is rich in vitamins and anti-oxidants. It is a perfect option to deeply cleanse and improve tone and texture. It is also great at minimising the appearance of dark spots and wrinkles. It is recommended for all skin types and it has little or no side effects. Chemical Peels This type of facial is typically used as an anti-ageing treatment. A chemical peel is a technique used to improve the appearance of the skin on the face, neck, or hands. A chemical solution is applied to the skin that causes it to exfoliate and eventually peel off. The new skin is usually smoother and less wrinkled than the old skin. The new skin is also temporarily more sensitive to the sun. A chemical peel can also be used to improve the appearance of mild scars, treat certain types of acne, reduce age spots, freckles, and melasma. After getting a chemical peel, your skin is more sensitive to the sun. It is important to avoid the sun for at least a week and use sunscreen too. Dermaplaning Dermaplaning (aka blading or microplaning) is a skin treatment that involves using an exfoliating blade to slough off dead skin cells and hairs from your face. Dermaplaning helps to deal with acne scars, sun-damaged skin, dull skin, fine lines and wrinkles. Aromatherapy Facial Aromatherapy facial is a type of facial that is prepared with essential oils which deeply nourish the skin. This type of facial helps with stress relief because the essential oils have stress-relieving properties. It also detoxes your skin, relieves skin dryness, improves blood circulation in the body, treats poor skin conditions and, improves skin texture as the oils contain anti-inflammatory properties.
