The Nigeria Rugby Football Federation (NRFF) has submitted its ratified constitution to Rugby Africa, as part of the process to get the continental body lift the ban on the country. Rising from its general assembly in Benin City, the NRFF said the ratification of the constitution is a step towards being readmitted into the International Rugby Union, adding that Rugby Africa mandated the NRFF to meet to resolve all disputed areas of the rulebook. At the extraordinary Annual General Meeting attended by delegates from the various state chapters, Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) representatives, Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, as well as a representative of the Rugby Afrique, the federation also deliberated on relevant issues affecting the sport’s development. Speaking after the meeting, NRFF President, Dr. Ademola Are, thanked the Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare, for his support and passion for the growth of rugby in Nigeria. “I feel relieved at this stage because if we had failed, we would have been back to square one. A country that is not internationally recognised is not going to live up to its full potential,” he said. He commended members of the board and stakeholders for their show of solidarity, adding that the board is now set for business and hopes to actualise most of its programme this year. He also thanked sponsor of the meeting, CEO of Padmozi Marketing, Mike Itemuogba, for his contribution towards the hosting of the Extraordinary Congress.
 
Grace Iyorhe, who represented Rugby Afrique, said she was happy with the smooth conduct of the general assembly.
 
“This is what we have been waiting for, Rugby is set to open a new chapter in Nigeria and we will be happy to welcome the Country back to the International fold. She promised to submit the report to the continental body, adding that she believes the outcome would be positive based on the successful outcome of the Congress.
