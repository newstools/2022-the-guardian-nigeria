The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has filed N50 billion damages against the Federal Government and the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, over his abduction in Kenya and continued detention. Kanu, through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), also requested N100 million as compensation for the cost of the action at the Federal High Court in Abuja. Ozekhome said Kanu’s abduction and rendition to Nigeria without extradition proceedings or hearing in Kenya is a clear violation of Article 12(4) of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act CAP A9, LFN 2004. He said it also violates Article/part 5 (a) of the African Charter’s Principles and Guidelines on Human and Peoples’ Rights. He said the continued detention of Kanu on the strength of an amended charge filed after his forceful rendition to Nigeria is illegal and ultra vires the powers of the Federal Government and Malami under the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture, its operational protocol, and constitutional rights of the Plaintiff; and the UN Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 1948.
