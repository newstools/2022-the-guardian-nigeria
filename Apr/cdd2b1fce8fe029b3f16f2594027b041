The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mr Alkali Usman, says the rumour making the rounds that Kaduna is inaccessible by road, air, or train is mere propaganda. The IGP stated this during his operational visit to the Abuja-Kaduna road on Saturday in Kaduna. He said the visit was to check the situation along the Abuja-Kaduna road. Usman noted that they have already made arrangements to secure the road. “My coming out today is to check the deployment we made to ensure the road is safe and also to check the deployment we have made at the scene of the train accident where repairs are taking place. “We have also deployed our men to assist the engineers in taking care of the situation and I want to assure the public that the propaganda going around that Kaduna is inaccessible by road, air or train is not true. “The road is safe for motorists and we will try our best to keep it safer.” He added that the visit was also to ensure that officers and men deployed to keep security on the road are performing their duties diligently. The IGP explained that they would work with available resources given to commands, however, he called for improvement.
“Government is giving us the resources and in turn, we are deploying them to our commands. Usman, responding to questions from journalists on the certainty that passengers would no longer patronize the train when restored, said “It is only a perception, the incident has happened and gone, that, of course, has informed us on measures to take in ensuring such a thing does not occur again”. He called on the troops to be diligent and dedicated to discharging their national duties.
