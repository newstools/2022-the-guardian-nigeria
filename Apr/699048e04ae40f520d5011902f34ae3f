Prominent Urhobo socio-political organisation, Urhobo Solidarity Front (USF), has hailed the leadership of Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide, for its wisdom and courage in endorsing Olorogun David Edevbie as the consensus candidate of the Urhobo nation for the Delta 2023 governorship race. USF gave the commendation, yesterday, in a statement signed by its Secretary, Oghenekaro Umukoro, following the public statement by the leadership of UPU announcing its adoption of Edevbie as preferred aspirant from Urhobo land and Delta Central Senatorial District. The body reiterated the need for Delta Central and Urhobo nation to present a single consensus candidate at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary, scheduled to hold on May 21, to ensure Urhobo do not divide their votes at the congress. The group warned that the situation needed to be handled with caution not to make Delta Central lose the party’s governorship ticket. The group said it had uncovered plans by some agents of disunity in Urhobo land to counter the decision of the UPU, which it noted could also sell out the Urhobo nation and play into the hands of external forces bent on undermining the interest of the Urhobo nation. It said: “We have seen external forces and the saboteurs among us have gone on to sponsor a multiplicity of aspirants across Urhobo land with the objective of having Delta Central split our delegates to the advantage of other ethnic groups. “It is for this reason that we commend the UPU Worldwide for coming out to decide on a consensus candidate to ensure that Urhobo go into the primary with one voice and come out successful to produce the next Governor.” “We are also especially satisfied with the UPU Worldwide choice of Olorogun David Edevbie, who is known and widely accepted by all Deltans as the most qualified, most competent and best prepared, going by his high educational background, experience in the private sector in top corporations, both locally and internationally, and public service in support of various administrations of Delta State and the Presidency, to carry on the development of Delta State from where His Excellency, Governor Okowa will end.”
