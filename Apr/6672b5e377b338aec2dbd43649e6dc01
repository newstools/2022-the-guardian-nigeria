Former Lagos State and a presidential aspirant Bola Tinubu Monday met with some All Progressives Congress governours hours after Vice President Yemi Osinbajo formally declared to run for president. A source told The Guardian that at least 13 APC governors attended the meeting held at the Kebbi State Governor’s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja. Osinabjo met with governors on Sunday night ahead of his declaration earlier this morning. Governors at the meeting with Tinubu included Nasir El-Rufai (Kaduna), Babajide Sanwo-Olu (Lagos) Umaru Ganduje (Kano), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Mai Mala Buni (Yobe), Mohammed Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa) and Dapo Abiodun (Ogun). Others were Abudlrazaq Abdulrahman (Kwara), Hope Uzondinma (Imo), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa) and Isiaka Oyetola (Osun). Tinubu, Osinbajo and Minister for Transportation Rotimi Amaechi are considered the leading contenders to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Others such as former governors Orji Uzor Kalu and Rochas Okorocha and serving governors of Kogi and Ebonyi states Yahaya Bello and Dave Umahi are also seeking the ruling party’s ticket.
