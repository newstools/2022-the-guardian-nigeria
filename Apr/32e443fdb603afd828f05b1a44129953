Liverpool will be without striker Roberto Firmino, as he continues to struggle with a foot injury. They are aiming to go five top-flight games unbeaten at St James’ Park for the first time since May 1969. The Reds have failed to win seven of their previous 10 league trips to face Newcastle (D3, L4). Newcastle United manager, Eddie Howe, has no fresh injury concerns. Kieran Trippier and Callum Wilson are edging closer to returns from respective foot and calf issues but this game will come too soon for them. Curtis Jones and Kostas Tsimikas missed Liverpool’s midweek win over Villarreal with non-Covid related illnesses and both could return to the squad today. After winning four games in a row, the Magpies will be full of confidence as they face Jurgen Klopp’s side. Newcastle is winless in 10 Premier League meetings with Liverpool (D4, L6). Newcastle could win five consecutive Premier League games for the first time since November 2014 under Alan Pardew, a run that included a 1-0 home victory over Liverpool. The Magpies have won six consecutive home league matches and have lost just one of their last 12 top-flight games at St James’ Park. Newcastle has lost all five league fixtures this season against the current top four. Bruno Guimaraes has scored three goals and assisted one in his past three Premier League appearances. Liverpool has taken 37 points from their last 39 available in the Premier League (W12, D1). Jurgen Klopp’s side has lost one of the past 27 matches in all competitions (W21, D5). The Reds are unbeaten in all 10 of their away fixtures in 2022 (W8, D2). Liverpool has won all four Premier League matches this season played at 12:30pm (UK time) on a Saturday by an aggregate score of 11-0. Mohamed Salah has scored in six of his last seven league starts against Newcastle but has just one goal in four top-flight matches at St James’ Park. Culled from BBCSports
