Newly-appointed Super Eagles Team B Goalkeepers Trainer, Ike Shorunmu, believes the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) can solve the country’s goalkeeping problems, adding that he would devote attention to the league. Shorunmu noted that in the past, Nigeria’s goalkeepers came from the NPFL, which discovered and nurtured some of the best safe hands in Africa, adding that with adequate attention, more quality talents could be discovered from the league. Calling on home-based goalkeepers to prove that they are equal to the task when invited to the national team, Shorunmu said no sane coach would ignore local goalkeepers if they prove they can do the job with good performances for their clubs. The former Stationery Stores of Lagos star called on stakeholders in Nigerian football to find ways of revamping the NPFL to attract sponsors to the competition, adding that more players would be attracted to the league if they feel they can make descent living in the domestic league. He said: “If great goalkeepers like Vincent Enyeama, Peter Rufai, Alloy Agu, Wilfred Agbonavbare and others can be discovered from the domestic scene before moving to clubs in Europe, I see no reason why such situation cannot be replicated now. “I believe talents abound in Nigeria, all we need to do is to come together to discover the talents, expose and nurture them to quality players. “Going overseas to get goalkeepers for the Eagles is not the best if we consider the past achievements of goalkeepers discovered in Nigeria. “However, the home-based players can only assert their authority in the national team if they work hard and prove that they deserve to get national team invitation.”
