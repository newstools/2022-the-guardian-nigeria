Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo, on Friday in Benin, enjoined Christians to emulate the virtues of tolerance, love, and selflessness as shown by Jesus Christ on Good Friday. Obaseki gave the charge in a message to mark Good Friday, a Christian holiday in preparation for the Easter celebration. He urged Christians to use the celebration of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ for mankind on Calvary, to reflect on the significance of the day by imbibing the virtues of love, tolerance, and selflessness. “It is only when we are able to tolerate and accommodate others; love one another irrespective of religious, political, ethnic, or ideological differences, and live selflessly as Jesus Christ did by sacrificing his life on the cross, that we will be able to tackle the many challenges facing us as a country and people,” he said. Obaseki urges all to be their brother’s keeper, uphold the spirit of togetherness and remain resolute on their love for God and our nation.
