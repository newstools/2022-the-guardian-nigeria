They are conscious about their body, how they look and would search for solutions wherever it can be found. Consequently, people are conscious of who and where they go to for treatment, and ultimately, they make caring for their body personal. One of such places is Murray’s Corner. Also known as MurrayKurves Secrets, it was founded by Aderemi Hellen Fiyin, and offers such services as fat reduction, butt and hip enhancement, laser and facial treatment, teeth whitening, stretch mark removal, skin tag removal, pedicure, and waxing, among other services. One of Murray’s Corner’s specialty is in the area of helping clients with low libido get their mojo back. “Unlike many women, I never had issues with my sexuality until 2018 when I had a history of hormonal imbalance, I experienced a lot of dryness during intercourse, I became really frigid and sex was a problem for me,” revealed Fiyin. Speaking further, the Murray’s Corner founder said: “I started conducting research on my issue and found out about some fruits and vegetables that I could mix to help my sexual problems. I started mixing and drinking and got my groove back. This was also one of my encounters with aphrodisiacs. “I began making great recipes to help boost my libido. And I started putting it into use for all of my other clients who complain of such and it has been of great help,” she added.
