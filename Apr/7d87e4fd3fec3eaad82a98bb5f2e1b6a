Says Aderoju is authentic state chairman The National Chairman, Social Democratic Party (SDP), Dr. Olu Agunloye, has dismissed the parallel state congress held by the party in Oyo State. Agunloye’s reaction is coming on the heels of a report that the party held a parallel state congress in Oyo State on Saturday that produced two state chairmen. He said authentic congress of SDP was held at the Havana Conference near the University of Ibadan main gate. He said the only one recognised by the national body of the party, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and various security agents produced Okunlade Michael Aderoju as the state chairman, while Idowu Owokoya emerged as State Secretary. Agunloye said that there was, however, a commotion towards the end of the congress, alleging that one Mr. Kola Balogun came with about 30 thugs to disrupt the event but were curtailed  by the law enforcement agents.
