Promoters of the much-awaited world heavyweight boxing title rematch between champion, Oleksandr Usyk and the man he dethroned, Anthony Joshua, are expected to unveil the date and venue of the fight in two weeks’ time. Three world titles will be at stake in the fight. According to dazn.com, Saudi Arabia has been touted as a likely venue for the fight with the Kingdom able to offer up a huge sum to the fighters. Saudi Arabia had been considered for last year’s planned bout between Joshua and Tyson Fury. Joshua last fought there in 2019 in his rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. Instead, Joshua fought his WBO mandatory Usyk when Fury was obliged to complete a trilogy rematch with Deontay Wilder. While Fury emerged victorious in October, Joshua lost his three belts – IBF, WBA and WBO – to Usyk in September. Speaking to Sky Sports, Alexander Krassyuk said: “Within the next two weeks, we expect to finalise details. “This location is under discussion at the moment. Late June is also the timing we are considering now. “Many things will depend on how fast we manage to ink the papers. The good thing is that Usyk is already in Europe to start his preparation.” The fight had been expected to take place in April or May, but the event had to be put back because Usyk returned to his country to take up arms against Russia following the invasion, which began in late February. The government later gave Usyk and fellow boxer, Vasily Lomachenko, permission to leave the country to compete in boxing fights, but only Usyk has taken up the offer so far.
