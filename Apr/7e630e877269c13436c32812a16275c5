Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel, has declared that Nigeria has no direction and that 2023 will determine whether Nigeria would move forward or not. Emmanuel, who was in Calabar, yesterday, to consult with delegates and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members on his presidential aspiration, said Nigeria was comatose and needed to be “rescued and restored”. He said: “Today, we must all rise and restore Nigeria as everything has gone and the only industry is the extractive industry. Any country waiting for monthly allocation is a finished country. “If God must rescue Nigeria, God must use a man and that man is Udom Emmanuel and I offer myself to rescue Nigeria and we must rescue and restore.” Emmanuel was accompanied by his campaign Director-General and former governor of Benue State, Gabriel Suswan; former Nigeria’s ambassador to Russia, Assam Assam (SAN), and Cross River National Assembly caucus Chairman, Gershom Bassey and others. He said: “When the PDP was in power, the exchange rate of naira was N186 to a dollar but now it is over N500 and the unemployment rate is high as Nigeria is now a country, where graduates are gatemen.” He said any country that must revamp its economy and grow must have a national carrier like Ethiopia, connecting everywhere; yet Nigeria cannot boast of one plane. Emmanuel also decried the poor security situation in Nigeria saying: “We need sincerity to tackle it. Our foreign policy today is completely dead. What stops us from drafting a policy that will make people respect our currency?” Earlier, Suswan, while introducing Emmanuel, said the Federal Government had failed woefully, noting that for the country to move forward, there’s a need to move away from primordial sentiments, which had run the country aground. While Imoke said that going by Emmanuel’s presentation, no one would doubt his capability to rule the country, Ikem commended him for his achievements and for presenting himself to rescue Nigeria.
