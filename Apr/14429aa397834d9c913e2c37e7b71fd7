Plans are at advanced stage by the Federal Government to equip the 84 border locations in Nigeria with e-border monitoring cameras to check issues of illegal immigrants and other border criminal activities.
   
The Acting Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Alhaji Isah Idris, who disclosed this after a tour of facilities of the Control Post in Akwa Ibom Command, said the Federal Government has signed an agreement with a Chinese company for the installation of the surveillance cameras across the locations.
   
Isah said the implementation of the e-border monitoring would kick-start from second quarter of 2022. According to him, when the operations commence, monitoring of borders across the country would be real-time online, using Information and Communications Technology (ICT) system.  “Of course, ICT requires money and we are going to be all time online. The President has equally approved the construction of our data communications centre in Abuja. It is a pilot product where we can view what is happening at Illela in Sokoto live.
   
“If they have connected Ibaka to our communications centre, you can see what we are doing here, realtime online. That’s what the Government is doing.
 
“So, Government is doing well and it requires the support of the communities and Nigerians to achieve complete security of the nation. I assure you by second quarter of this year the implementation will start,” Idris said.
