An aspirant to the House of Representatives in Lagos State Afeez Ipesa-Balogun has promised to donate his salary and allowances to the development of his constituency, if elected to represent Oshodi Federal Constituency 1.
  
Ipesa-Balogun, a former Chairman of Oshodi/Isolo Local Government, who declared to vie for the ticket of the constituency under the All Progressives Congress (APC), said he would not take salary and allowances for personal use as a member of the House of Representatives but for the development of every level of the constituency.
   
Ipesa-Balogun, also a former member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, said he would set up a Constituency Trust Fund to which his salary and allowances would be paid into and then applied to all areas of the constituency, if he won the party’s primary to run for the Oshodi Federal Constituency 1 and gets elected into the house.
