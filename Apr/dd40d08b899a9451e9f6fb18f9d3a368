The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe State has described the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain and former governor Ibrahim Dankwambo as a peace loving and a leader worthy of emulation. APC applauded Dankwambo for his display of “rare peace and calmness.” The party hinged its applause on the fact that as intimidating as the crowd that trooped out to receive him last Saturday, no breach of peace was either noted or recorded. Addressing newsmen, the APC state publicity Secretariat, Moses Kyari said it was expected that since he was coming to the state first time in three years after he left office he would be escorted by touts and thugs: “unlike his predecessor, Senator Danjuma Goje who visited the state with thugs and breached the peace as his thugs wrecked severe havocs, Dankwambo came in like an ordinary man, save for the crowd that received him, he would have gone for nobody.” He stated that “we were not surprised at all because we know the kind of person Dankwambo is; he is not violent; he is a peace loving personality just like Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya.” The party also appreciated Governor Yahaya for his understanding of the polity not to “go ahead with a state function around the PDP Secretariat on Saturday to avoid political supporters’ clash that may arise.” He urged politicians in the state to imbibe the spirit of love in pursuit of their ambition. He however warned that the state may be forced into severe action next time Senator Goje and or his supporters attempt to cause a breach of peace.
