Over 19 years after conception of the Brass Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) project, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, has indicated the initiative might come back to life. This came as a gas company, Greenville NLG, showed interest in the project, which was conceived in 2003 and expected to cost $20 billion	. Speaking during an inspection of the project site in Twon Brass, Bayelsa State, with the management of Greenville, Sylva said government was keen on completing the project because of its manifold economic benefits. The project, which has Trains 1-4 concept, with a yearly projected capacity of 8.4 million metric tons, was initiated in 2005. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo performed the groundbreaking ceremony on May 14, 2007. In a statement, Sylva said: “We want this project to pull through, this time, and we will do everything possible to ensure that the Final Investment Decision (FDI) is taken as soon as possible.”
