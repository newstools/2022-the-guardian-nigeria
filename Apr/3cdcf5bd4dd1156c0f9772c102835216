The Group Chief Executive Officer (GCEO) of the Guaranty Trust Holding Company Plc (GTCo), Segun Agbaje has decried the increase in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), which he said has further made things difficult for banks. 
    
The implication of the high CRR for Nigerian banks, he said, is that money that would have generated more interest profits is being held with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
   
Agbaje also assured that the completion of its restructuring into a holding company structure, will take it beyond current valuation.
   
While he disclosed the plan of the company to update its banking software this year to a friendlier and more adaptable platform; he mentioned that it will also be publishing what its payment company does quarterly. “We are going to create transparency in the Financial Technology (FinTech) industry that doesn’t exist.”
