Not only is that a waste of material, experts say it’s also needlessly contributing to the climate crisis. The textile sector accounts for up to 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.  To help extend the life of clothes, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) leads the Innovative Business Practices and Economic Models in the Textile Value Chain (InTex). The three-year project is designed to improve resource efficiency and promote circularity in textiles.  One of the programme’s members is Africa Collect Textiles, a Kenyan start-up that upcycles textile waste into rugs, toys, yarn and other products that can be re-introduced to the market.  Through InTex and the Beat Pollution campaign, UNEP is developing innovative economic models that reduce the impact of pollution and improve human and environmental health.
