A renowned socio-political activist and critic, Otunba Adesunbo Onitiri, has advised the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, to resolve the matter between the Federal Government and university lecturers immediately or resign as the minister without delay. 
 
In a statement in Lagos, yesterday, Onitiri said Adamu must be told the truth that he cannot continue to remain in office while Nigeria’s university education is being messed up with lecturers on indefinite strike for months and the government unconcerned.  Onitiri regretted that because of ASUU’s strike, many university students have taken to crime because idle hands are the devil’s workshop.  “All the higher institutions are on strike and on compulsory vacation. Now that our national elections are around the corner, we cannot afford to have our youths idle. They will provide easy bodyguards to our devilish politicians.”
