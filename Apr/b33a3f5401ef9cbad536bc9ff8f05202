She confirmed her engagement in an interview with Beat FM in January. The interviewer had asked her about the diamond ring she had on her finger and how she got it. Showing off the ring, she responded, “Some guy gave it to me and said, ‘hey would you marry me?“ “It’s a diamond ring for real, and it’s forever,” she continued. The pregnant singer confirmed her engagement to be one of the reasons she has been glowing. “I was already glowing before I met him; if I was not a package, I wouldn’t have said yes,” She said. Seyi Shay also debuted her second studio album Big Girl in 2021. Speaking to Guardian Life, she described the album as “a defining moment for me. It’s a body of work that I’ve been wanting to create for years. Musically, I’m in my element, and I’ve never been so brutally honest with lyrics and emotions in a song in my life.”
