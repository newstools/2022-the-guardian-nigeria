The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has approved the Local Passengers’ Flight Welfare Scheme for Anchor Insurance Company Limited. This was contained in a statement signed by the company’s Managing Director, Ebose Augustine, who said that the scheme would run concurrently with its existing general insurance products. In its approval letter to the Company, NAICOM stated: “In the exercise of the powers conferred on the Commission by Insurance Act 2003, your company is hereby granted a ‘no objection’ to introduce your product tagged ‘Local Passengers’ Flight Welfare Scheme’ to the Nigerian Insurance market.” According to Augustine, the company sees the development as another opportunity to make the Nigerian local flight passengers enjoy more peace of mind while flying. He urged the local aviation operators to see the insurance product as a value-added package that will endear them to valued passengers. Ebose said: “As one of the fastest-growing insurance companies in Nigeria, we thrive in providing our clients with top quality insurance care through our friendly and experienced professionals, timely claim administration, customer-friendly products and super customer experience delivery.”
