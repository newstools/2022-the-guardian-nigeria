Stop Wild Goose Chase, Olomu Warns Petitioners All Youths Re-Oriented Initiative Of Nigeria (AYRION) has petitioned the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission to investigate corruption allegations against the Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Ogun State, Prof. Adewale Olomu. The petition was sequel to a ruling by a Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, that the non-governmental organisation had no locus standi to prosecute the MD. But determined to get justice in the matter, AYRION, in the petition, requested the investigation of Olomu and prosecution if found culpable. “We are a non-governmental organisation birthed into existence to, among others, defend the future of the Nigerian youth by fighting corruption in public places, defend the defenceless, and re-orientate the youth, by inculcating developmental norms and values for the achievement of dreams and national development “It is with great pleasure that we wish to draw your attention to the case our organisation maintained against the Federal Ministry of Health as first respondent and the Medical Director of Abeokuta Federal Medical Centre, Prof. Adewale Olomu, with no FHCIAB/100/20221 as the second respondent, for age falsification, abuse of office and irreconcilable names on certificates, which judgment was given against us, but not on the merit but based on preliminary objections.” As the court did not decide whether or not the second respondent is liable for age falsification, abuse of office and irreconcilable names on certificates.” But the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the medical facility, Mr. Segun Orisajo, called on the group to stop the wild goose chase and concentrate on a more fruitful venture. He advised the youth organisation to toe the path of peace and accept, in good fate, the decision of the court of law on the matter.
