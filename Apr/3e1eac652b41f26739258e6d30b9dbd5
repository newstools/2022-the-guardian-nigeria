Sir: Many people are used to this saying, ‘the reward of the teacher is in heaven.’ This has made several people not appreciate the efforts of teachers in shaping the lives of the students whom they teach and in turn the society in which they live. This has also given room to the ill-treatment of teachers, especially by some state governments. For example, in states like Benue, teachers are the worst hit whenever it comes to non-payment of salaries.
