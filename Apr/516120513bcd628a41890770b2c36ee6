Stakeholders in the justice administration and correctional sectors have canvassed attitudinal change towards ex-convicts. 
The experts said unless ex-offenders are integrated into the society without stigmatisation, the problem of minimising criminality will persist. 
   
They expressed the view at a two-day workshop on inmates’ behavioural and cognitive modification programmes, organised by the Prison Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) with the Theme: “Remedial Programmes Symbiotic Reinforcement held at R & A City Hotel, Ikeja Lagos.” 
   
The Executive Director of Prisoner’s Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA), Dr Uju Agomoh, said a society that refuses to reintegrate offenders and ex-offenders further forces them to embrace those who have hard criminal networks and that will be worse for the country.
