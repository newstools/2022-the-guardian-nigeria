Following the failure of the Super Eagles of Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the erstwhile Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen, has stepped down from that position with immediate effect. The NFF has in the meantime withdrawn the two-and-a-half year contract offered the coaches and terminated the appointment of the entire technical crew of the team with immediate effect. A new crew will be announced after a proper review to lead the new charge of reinvigorating the Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately, the federation said. “We thank the coaches and team officials for their service to the nation and wish them success in their future endeavours,” said NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi. Super Eagles failure on Tuesday brought to the fore the number of failed attempts by the various national teams under coach Augustine Eguavoen. Eguavoen led the Nigeria Golden Eaglets to crash out in the group stage of the FIFA U-17 World Cup at Finland 2003, the worst ever record at that level till date. Three years later, Eguavoen led the Super Eagles to lose to Cote d’Ivoire in the semifinal at Egypt 2006 Cup of Nations despite parading a star-studded team with the likes of Austin Okocha, Nwankwo Kanu, Wilson Oruma, Julius Aghahowa, Garba Lawal, among others. In 2007, he led the Super Eagles to suffer a 4-1 defeat to Ghana in a friendly match, which stands till date as one of Eagles’ worst results ever against the Black Stars. Eguavoen also failed to qualify the U-23 team for London 2012 Olympic Games, after the team grabbed a silver medal under coach Samson Siasia at the previous Olympic Games at Beijing 2008. Eguavoen led the Super Eagles to crash out in the round of 16 at the last Africa Cup of Nations held in Cameroun, one of the worst performance in the history of Nigeria’s participation in the tournament.
