Spain will reopen its embassy in Kyiv “shortly,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Monday, the latest country to return its diplomats to the Ukrainian capital after the withdrawal of Russian forces. The country’s diplomatic delegation was evacuated from the Ukrainian capital to Poland shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. “We will reopen the Spanish embassy in Kyiv in Ukraine shortly, in the coming days, as another show of the commitment of the Spanish government, of Spanish society, with the people of Ukraine,” Sanchez said during an interview with private television Antena 3. Spain is providing support to Ukraine through military equipment, humanitarian aid and by welcoming Ukrainian refugees. Turkey has moved its embassy in Ukraine back to Kyiv after relocating it to Chernivtsi near the Romanian border. France announced last week that its embassy would return to Kyiv from the western city of Lviv.
