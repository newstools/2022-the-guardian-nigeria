Sports betting firm, Bet9ja, has warned perpetrators of a criminal cyber-attack on its operations to desist from such acts, just as it has advised its clients to be a little patient with it. The firm said in Lagos, yesterday, that its “betting platform, just like so many market-leading global organisations, has recently become a victim of a sophisticated criminal cyber-attack, which is restricting our customers from having access to the platform.”
