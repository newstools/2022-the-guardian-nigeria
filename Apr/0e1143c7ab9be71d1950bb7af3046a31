Holding on May 8, the concert dubbed, Asa Live In Lagos, will see the Nigerian-French chanteuse serve a live version of her career-defining fifth studio album dubbed, V, for the very first time. “I grab every opportunity to come home and perform. I do not want to be a stranger at home. Coming home this time around, I am super excited. People need to see what Asa has been doing elsewhere around the world. So, it’s a good thing to be back home performing. It’s going to be a different experience and vibe,” Asa tells Guardian Music, during a recent press briefing. For a singer notorious for her avant-garde performances across Europe and Africa, Asa is definitely one of the most enchanting stage performers in the continent. According to ace Nigerian comedian, Basketmouth, who is the host of the show, the concert is geared at creating a timeless experience for her fans. “We are talking to the Cavemen. We are talking to BOJ as well, people that can complement Asa’s kind of performance. We would have surprise artiste performances, as well. What we are trying to do is to give the audience something they will never forget in a hurry. The last time Asa headlined in Lagos was in 2017; so, this is like homecoming for her. She just released an album, which is doing amazing. With that new album definitely, the show is going to be memorable.”
