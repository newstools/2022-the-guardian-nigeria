The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) has concluded a plan to address gridlock arising from the operation of Pinnacle Oil and Gas FZE, one of the free zone enterprises (FZE) in the Lekki Free Zone, including the creation of a truck park. The Managing Director of the Authority, Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, disclosed this on Monday in response to the concern raised by the Nigeria Economic Zones Association. Executive Secretary of the association, Toyin Elegbede, had expressed frustration over gridlock, in recent times According to him, efforts made by the association to get both Lekki Free Zone Development Company and Pinnacle Oil to resolve the emerging traffic crisis has not yielded any result. “This has led to scores of tankers parking on the road, effectively converting it into a truck park. This affects the flow of traffic and throws all stakeholders in the axis into distress. The current shortage of fuel has exacerbated the issue as it has hampered the operations of other businesses operating from the axis,” Elegbede stated. But the NEPZA boss, commending the association for its intervention, said: “We shall take up the matter immediately to resolve whatever constraint the parties are confronted with. “I will summon a meeting on this matter. A truck park must be created within Lekki Free Zone to accommodate the number of trucks doing business in the Lekki Free Zone axis. “As an immediate step, we will ensure that the Lekki Free Zone and Pinnacle Oil operate in such a manner that trucks are not parked on the road.
