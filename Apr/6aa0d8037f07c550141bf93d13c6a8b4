The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and Google Global Services Nigeria have forged an alliance toward the actualisation of national targets for ubiquitous broadband access in furtherance of Nigeria’s digital transformation policy. 
  
The two organisations made the commitment when a delegation from Google Global Services Nigeria paid a courtesy visit to the commission’s head office in Abuja recently to deliberate on viable collaborative interventions to propel digital transformation across the country and Africa.  The EVC expressed optimism that Google’s investment in the subsea cable, Equiano, which is expected to land in Nigeria by end of April 2022, will be more impactful in driving NCC’s ongoing implementation of the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP), 2020-2025, aimed at increasing broadband penetration to 70 per cent by 2025.
