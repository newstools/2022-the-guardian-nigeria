• Says N157b released to fund project
Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, the Chairman, Board of Directors of the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr. Farouk Gumel, and the NSIA Managing Director, Uche Orji, on Saturday, began inspection of the second Niger Bridge project. The visit came barely three weeks after President Muhammadu Buhari inspected work on the project. Buhari, who was represented by his Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, was accompanied by Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola; Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige; Orji and other top officials of government. Speaking shortly after the inspection, Ahmed described the bridge as a very significant project for the Federal Government. She said the government attached so much importance to it because of the huge developmental impact it would have on the lives of Nigerians. Ahmed expressed satisfaction on the pace and quality of the job done by both NSIA and Julius Berger. The minister said: “Today is a very significant day in the construction circle of the second Niger bridge. This is one of the most iconic projects in the country at an initial contract cost of N206 billion. “Today, we have been able to fund this project with N157 billion and I’m here to see where all this money is going. And also, the significance of today is that the two ends of the bridge are being put together, and this is the final phase of the work in truly competing the project and finishing work.” “So, technically, I can report to Mr. President that I have seen where all the N157 billion has gone. This is a project that is very dear to the President and it is designed to uplift the lives and livelihood of people of the South East and other parts of the country. And we hope that when this project comes on stream, it will ease traffic, will enhance commercial activities and improve the lives of people of the state.”
