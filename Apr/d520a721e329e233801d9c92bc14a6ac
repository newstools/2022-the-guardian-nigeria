The All Progressives Grand Alliance Party (APGA) in Benue has vowed to win the governorship election in the state in 2023. The party Chairman, Mr Paul Salem, said this on Saturday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi. He said that the party knew what it takes to win elections and what the people want in the state for development to thrive. Salem said the party had done a lot to sensitise the people against selling their votes and their future for “peanuts”. He said the party would not disclose its winning strategy at the moment saying APGA would surprise so many at the end of the election. “We believe with our major input, we would win, it might look somehow to somebody that APGA would win, but with God on our side, it will happen. “Nobody believed APGA could do anything in Benue in 2019, but the party was able to win  Three House of Representatives seats and I know something new is going to happen,” Salem said. He said three people were currently aspiring for the Benue governorship position on the platform of the party including a female. Speaking on consensus, Salem said that it would deny the rights of the people, adding that he believed in democracy of impact. “Let the masses decide on who they want at the primaries which are coming up very soon,” he said. NAN reports that APGA would hold its primaries on May 10 for the ad hoc delegates election, and May 24 for the State House of Assembly. The party would hold its House of Reps primaries on May 26, while that of Senate and Election Appeal has been slated for May 28. The party’s governorship primaries would be held on May 29 while the presidential primary is on June 1. NAN reports that the governorship primaries would be held in Makurdi, while the State House of Assembly would hold at the various state constituency headquarters, along likewise the House of Representatives.
