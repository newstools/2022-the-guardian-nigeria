Similarly, all other indices, finished higher except NGX Asem, NGX Growth and Sovereign Bond indices which closed flat. The market opened for four sessions last week as the Federal Government declared Friday a public holiday to commemorate Good Friday. Notably, bargain hunting in Nigerian Breweries (+11.8 per cent), Zenith Bank (+8.7 per cent), GTCO (+6.5 per cent), Okomuoil (+5.6 per cent), MTN Nigeria (+3.4 per cent) and Dangite Cement (+2.4 per cent) spurred the weekly gain. The development triggered a month-to-date increase of the MTD and YTD return to +1.2 per cent and 11.2 per cent, respectively.
Also, sectoral performance was broadly positive following gains in the Banking (+5.6 per cent), Consumer Goods (+1.9 per cent), Industrial Goods (+1.6 per cent), Oil and Gas (+1.6 per cent) and Insurance (+1.1 per cent) indices. Analysts at Codros Capital said: “In the near term, we expect the bulls to retain dominance given the positioning for the Q1, 22 earnings announcements, even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the FI market. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Despite the profit taking in the banking sector, the NGXBNK closed as the week’s best performing sector with a 5.59 per cent gain. “We expect to see further profit taking in that space going into the new week amid last week’s record gain.
“We expect Q1 results of some companies to hit the market next week, and we anticipate this to drive market sentiments as well.” Consequently, a total turnover of 1.25 billion shares worth N22.4 billion was recorded in 23,406 deals by investors on the floor of the exchange, higher than a total of 1.1 billion units, valued at N10.8 billion that was exchanged in 23,471 deals during the preceding week.
