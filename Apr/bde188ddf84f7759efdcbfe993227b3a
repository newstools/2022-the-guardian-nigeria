There are strong indications that the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, will declare to contest the presidential election on Tuesday, April 19, 2022. Responding to a clarion call by his supporters in the All Progressives Congress (APC), who thronged the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, to receive him, Ngige promised to respond to their demand next Tuesday. He noted that the Southeast zone has remained the only part of Nigeria that has not tasted the country’s presidency. Ngige, who described the presence of the crowd as “Easter Ambush”, said he had got similar calls from his brethren in the past, assuring he would speak this time around. He invited them to his country home on Tuesday to get a response, pointing out that he has done extensive consultations. Earlier, spokesman of the group, Tony Chime, told Ngige that they came to the airport to plead with him to contest for president in the 2023 election. Chime said their demand was based on his good records when he was Anambra State Governor and now a Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
