Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt has fixed May 11 for the hearing of the fundamental human rights enforcement suit filed by the Chairman of Ibeto Cement, Cletus Ibeto, against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and a businessman, Chief Daniel Chukwudozie. Justice Boma Diepiri, who had earlier fixed Monday for the hearing of the suit, adjourned it following an application by Ibeto’s counsel, Onyechi Ikpeazu (SAN), for more time to reply to a counter-affidavit filed by the respondents. Counsel for the EFCC, Simon Ibekwute, and that of the second respondent, Patrick Ikwueto (SAN), urged the court to grant them an extension of time to enable them reply to the motion by the applicant. After listening to the parties, Justice Diepiri said he would not deny them their constitutional rights and adjourned till May 11, to hear their motions. The judge directed counsels to get all their processes ready before the next adjourned date and that they should come to court with, at least, photocopies of all the authorities cited. Ibeto had dragged the EFCC and Chief Chukwudozie before the court through a Fundamental Rights Enforcement suit. In the suit, he seeks to prevent the anti-graft agency from investigating allegations of fraud bordering on obtaining by false pretence, the sum of N4.8 billion, forgery and criminal breach of trust brought against him by Dozzy Oil and Gas Limited.
