University of Jos’ (UNIJOS) preparation to host the Nigerian Universities Games Association (NUGA) sports festival in 2024 has been boosted by the Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Kim Young – Chae, who has commissioned an indoor taekwondo gymnasium complex built, funded and donated by the Korean government to the university.
 
The gymnasium also has a table tennis court, boxing training kit, basketball court and badminton, as well as a gallery that can accommodate about 200 spectators. Speaking on his visit to UNIJOS, Young-Chae said he came to commission the sports complex because the university and Korean Embassy have a longstanding relationship. “Korean government has been a good partner of Nigeria for decades in terms of politics, economy and education because training young people to become professionals in their various fields of endeavours remains our target,” he said. Earlier, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Prof. Tanko Ishaya, said the institution is privileged to be in a cordial relationship with the Korean Embassy, noting that the whole process that saw the actualisation of the indoor sports complex started right from the administration of former Vice Chancellor, Prof. Sabastine Seddi Maimako.
 
Ishaya added: “It is our prayer that the friendship will continue to mature as we desire to have sports institute.”
   
He stated that the institution was lucky to have a good contingent that performed credibly well in the recently concluded NUGA 2022 in Lagos, adding, “we hope to host the best NUGA in 2024.”
