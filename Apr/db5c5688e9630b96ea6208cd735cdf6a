Mukaddas explained further that N250,000 each will also be given to 22 persons who were severely injured. It stated: “Three hundred and sixty-nine victims were called and offered opportunities for psychological support, 264 persons accepted the offers and were supported. “We secured ambulances and busses for evacuation and moved to the scene. Before arrival, the military had commenced evacuation. We, therefore, evacuated the dead bodies, few severely wounded victims and one person that escaped captivity. “We deposited the dead at the 44 NARH and others at St. Gerald’s Hospital for treatment. We set up a crisis centre, which availed families of the victims opportunity to call for enquiries and provide relevant information about their missing relatives,” he added.
