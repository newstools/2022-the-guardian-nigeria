In an exclusive video clip shared via her fan newsletter, JLo gushes over her beautiful green-hued diamond ring. The ring features an emerald-cut, pale green diamond. Lopez says softly, “you’re perfect”, as romantic music plays in the video. She also shared a teaser of the clip on social media, captioning the post “major announcement” as fans began to send messages of congratulations to the couple. Lopez teased the “exciting and special” announcement on Facebook earlier Friday evening. Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck first met on the set of rom-com Gigil back in 2001, and the two soon became the IT couple by August of the same year. In November 2002, Bennifer announced their engagement after Affleck proposed to the singer with a 6.1-carat pink diamond that cost him $2.5 million. However, the two announced the end of their relationship two years later for reasons not disclosed. But true love, they say, never dies, and the couple once again reunited in April 2021 after Lopez’s engagement to Alex Rodriguez ended. In February, Lopez told PEOPLE that compared to 18 years ago, their connection this time is different. “We’re older now, we’re smarter, we have more experience, we’re at different places in our lives, we have kids now, and we have to be very conscious of those things.”
