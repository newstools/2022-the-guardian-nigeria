Political pressure group, Citizens Alliance Project (CAP), has called on Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State to step up for a national assignment and be part of the team that would rescue Nigeria in 2023. Making the call during a press conference, National Chairman of the group, Shedrack Agediga, said their membership strength cuts across all geopolitical zones in the country, saying: “As a group, we are well informed on the politics of Nigeria and we have been following with keen interest.” Agediga, who was flanked by the Director of Mobilisation, Ambassador Obinna Nwoke and Coordinator North, Alhaji Muktar Usman of the group, said: “Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, a founding member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has grown through the ranks as a public officer from being secretary to Local Government Council to Chairman of Local Government Council, Commissioner, Secretary to State Government, a Senator representing Delta North Senatorial District at the National Assembly and governor of Delta state.” “In all these assignments of public interest, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has provided credible service to the people, who freely gave him their mandates, trusting in his capacity to deliver. In 2015 after the party primaries election that saw his emergence as the flag bearer of the PDP, the Smart Agenda began like every other normal political mantra and after his popular victory at the polls has long gone beyond a mere mantra to becoming a clear policy direction of a very focused and people-oriented government in Delta state.” Agediga concluded: “With a very rich experience in people-oriented leadership provision and the state of the Nigerian state, we can without any equivocation call on the governor of Delta state, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, to step up for a national assignment of being part of the team that will rescue Nigeria in 2023.
