No fewer than 150 children are participating in the ongoing Tiger Tennis Foundation Easter Training and Tournament holding at the National Stadium in Surulere, Lagos. Foundation founder and tournament director, Moses Paul, said it has been a life-long dream to gather kids and bring them up to speed with the latest skills in tennis and expose them to national, regional and international competitions. He said the Easter holidays provided opportunity to finally launch out with his Tennis Foundation, which, he hopes to expand in the coming years. At the event, which started on Monday and will end on Saturday, the registered kids are expected to undergo training at different age categories for each of the days. “I am grateful to God that this opportunity has finally come my way. The training and tournament are open to national players because it is an open event. We want to give everybody opportunity to participate in the training.
  
“As we speak, over 150 children are already here, and we are still expecting much more. Training for all age categories (ages nine and under 12, 14, 16 and 18) held on Monday and yesterday, while the tournament proper is for Wednesday and Thursday. “The semifinal matches for all categories will hold on Thursday and Friday, while the finals for all six categories and presentation of prizes will hold on Saturday.” Paul said he was overwhelmed by the number of registered players, adding that over 200 players came in from Abuja, Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Lagos and Ekiti states yesterday for the exercise. National junior tennis coaches were on hand to instruct the players and guide them through the training sessions according to their age categories. Supported by the Nigeria Tennis Federation (NTF), Paul urged parents, coaches and players to follow the order of the one-week training and tournament to ensure a successful event.
