Photo credit; The Independent John Boyega has revealed he would like to feature in the hit series Bridgerton. The actor made this known in subtle ways during an interview. Sources say that when asked if he would be open to joining the romantic drama series, the 30-year-old actor responded in a Bridgerton-style voice and said, ‘Oh absolutely!’ He added ‘I would, I’m all about versatility. That’s what we were taught especially in drama school, we were taught about roles that wouldn’t necessarily come our way but we were still trained to try and portray it. So yeah definitely, I would love to be in things that are more nuanced. After this period and doing Star Wars and being on quite a strict eight-year contract and being out of that, my man now feels like a football player like, “what team?” He praises the clourblind casting of Bridgerton, noting that black characters take up significant roles that with the mention of race, they would typically not be cast. Since the beginning of his career, Boyega has shown diversity in the roles he depicts. Featuring as Finn in the latest Star Wars trilogy, ending with the final installment The Rise of Skywalker released in late 2019. After that, Boyega has featured in fantasy, sci-fi, and crime comedy. Away from such genres Boyega’s latest feature is the historical epic The Woman King with Viola Davis, and Attack The Block 2film. Explaining further Boyega said he is open to more space for a fresh take on his career.
