Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has urged members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state to play politics with decorum and not see the forthcoming general elections as do-or-die affairs. Abiodun, who stated this while addressing the party faithful at a Ramadan Iftar organised for members from the three senatorial districts, at the Presidential Lodge, Abeokuta, said the party would follow its constitution to the letter without prejudice in selecting people that will represent the state at all levels during the election. This, he noted, would sustain the party’s stronghold in all the 20 local councils and 236 wards. The governor noted that his administration since inception had done a lot through the implementation of workable policies and programmes in ensuring that the APC waxes stronger daily. He further said that the party had since become a beautiful bride as people from other political parties have joined it to be part of the success story. He, therefore, promised that the party state executive committee led by Yemi Sanusi and other leaders across the state would do everything possible to make the state primary elections crisis-free. While charging the party members to imbibe the spirit of love and forgiveness in line with the spirit of Ramadan, the governor further urged them to continue to support the government in its determination to reposition the state. The former governor of the state, Olusegun Osoba, in his remarks, admonished the party members to avoid  foul language during campaigns, expressing confidence that the party would emerge victorious in 2023. Also, Sanusi noted that the victory of the party in the state during the general elections in 2019 was as a result of the determination and co-operation displayed by party members. He urged them not to relent but continue with such collaborative spirit, as the party leaders would not disappoint them during the forthcoming general elections.
