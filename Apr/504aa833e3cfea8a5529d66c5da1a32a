The Speaker of Bauchi State House of Assembly, Abubakar Sulaiman, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. He announced his defection during the breaking of fast last night at the Government House Bauchi, with Governor Bala Mohammed alongside PDP stakeholders from Ningi, Toro, Warji and Dass local government areas of the state. Abubakar emerged as speaker of the Assembly during a controversial election on June 21, 2019 on the floor of the assembly by 11 members of the 31 lawmakers. At the inauguration of the 9th assembly, PDP had 8 members, APC 22 and a member under NNPP. The development created a factional speaker, who later submitted to the leadership of Abubakar after 16 months. About three years after his emergence, Sulaiman said his decision to return to the PDP was as a result of his good understanding and working relationship with the governor and promised to work together for the best interest of the state. “I want to use this opportunity today to officially announce to His Excellency, the Executive Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed and other stakeholders in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) of my formal defection to the State ruling party,” Sulaiman said. “One of my reasons to return to PDP is in recognition of the exemplary leadership style of our Governor and his commitment to transforming the state.” With Abubakar’s defection, APC has 16 members while PDP has 15. A source told The Guardian that another member of the APC is expected to follow the Speaker while the majority leader, Tijjani Aliyu, has been consulting to leave the APC.
