The National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) has dissolved its Lagos State Council under Alhaji Musiliu Akinsanya, popularly known as MC Oluomo. The National Administrative Council of the union made this known, yesterday, in a statement titled, “Dissolution of Lagos State Administrative Council,” jointly signed by its National President, Alhaji Tajudeen Baruwa and General Secretary, Alhaji Kabiru Ado Ya’u, after a meeting held at the national headquarters of the union in Abuja. The union’s Secretary in Lagos State, Seyi Bankole, was subsequently announced as the new head of NURTW in Lagos. The statement reads in part: “On the strength of the development, all members of the union in Lagos State and beyond, including members of the public, are hereby kindly requested to henceforth stop dealing with members of the dissolved Lagos State administrative council on issues concerning the union.” Meanwhile, a source at the meeting said the national administrative council, after several minutes of deliberation, the union members resolved at about 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday that Lagos Council be dissolved immediately. The source added that before the decision was reached, there were arguments at the meeting on what measures to be taken against the executive members of the Lagos chapter and that after several minutes, it was agreed that the council be dissolved in accordance with the NURTW constitution. He disclosed that barely two weeks before the dissolution, the national executive had passed a resolution to grant pardon to MC Oluomo if he becomes remorseful and tenders an unreserved apology to the union. The source stressed that up till the moment before the dissolution was concluded, the suspended state chairman did not respond or appeal for more time to file his letter of apology before the transport body, a development that further aided the national administrative council’s decision.
