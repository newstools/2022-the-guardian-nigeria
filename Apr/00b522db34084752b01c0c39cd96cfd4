The afrobeat singer revealed this in an appearance on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah last night, where he discussed his journey since his last appearance on the show, selling out Madison Square Garden and his album Twice As Tall. Trevor Noah had expressed his surprise to hear that the album was produced on Zoom and asked him, “how do you know it’s going well?” To which Burna Boy replied, “You don’t; you hope for the best.” Burna Boy narrates how he made his Grammy winning album on zoom at The Daily Show with Trevor Noah pic.twitter.com/IL96MWa5Nj — African Folder (@africanfolder) April 27, 2022 Describing the production process, he said, “it’s not like you record the song on zoom.” “You just have the laptop on in the studio with all the parties involved while we’re making the music and stuff. And everyone’s like this is the song we have to choose, we have to choose this, and then yeah, it just worked out.” Burna Boy also teased his forthcoming album, but he’s still holding on to details; only hinting that “it’s going to come out on a day when everyone celebrates for themselves when it’s their own day.” (his birthday, maybe :)) Burna Boy released Twice As Tall in 2020, which went on to win the Best World Music Album at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards. Since the album’s release, Burna Boy has snagged several achievements, including selling out The O2 Arena and, more recently, The Madison Square Garden.
