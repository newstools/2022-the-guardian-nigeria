Federal Government has declared Monday, May 2 and Tuesday, May 3, 2022 as public holidays to mark Workers Day and Eid ul-Fitr celebrations. Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, made the declaration on behalf of the Federal Government. He congratulated workers across the country on this year’s celebration, urging them to raise the bar of their trade, in line with the President Muhammadu Buhari administration’s drive to rev up governance and make Nigerians derive maximum benefit from the nation. He also congratulated Muslims for the successful completion of the holy month of Ramadan, urging them to imbibe virtues of kindness, love, tolerance, peace, self-denial, sacrifice and good neighbourliness, as exemplified by the Holy Prophet Muhammad.
