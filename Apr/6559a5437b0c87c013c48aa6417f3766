The President-General of the Association of Igbo Maritime Practitioners in Nigeria (ASIMPIN), Damian Obianigwe, has raised alarm over what he called calculated attempts by a group of disgruntled people that claimed to be elders of the association to cause disaffection and plant bad blood amongst their members. Speaking through his Senior Special Assistant, Media, Godfrey Nwosu, he said unequivocally that nobody constituted any council of elders in the association and that a purported meeting by the so-called elders is a ruse. In his words: “I wonder who constituted the council, elders in Igbo cosmology are men of wisdom whose predominant attention is peace, rectitude and prudence. These attributes are deficient in the proponents of the meeting and their spurious claim of belonging to the council of elders. “It is noteworthy to state that Obianigwe has since taken bold steps towards constituting a committee to organise elections in the nearest future but for the effects of COVID 19 and unfortunate demise of two members of the association namely: Dom Obi, Secretary-General of the Association and the former first electoral committee Chairman, Chief Achike Molokwu.” The royal father further assured all genuine members of the association of his unalloyed commitment and efforts to keep hope alive and stand the great association on the solid ground better than it was from its inception. He also advised all those that embark on campaigns of calumny by writing frivolous releases to turn a new leaf and genuinely help in contributing to the success of the association, which the President General nurtured from infancy to greater heights today.
