Rihanna, who was officially certified as a billionaire in August 2021 due to her vast beauty and lingerie empire, debuted at no 1729 on the 2022 Forbes World Billionaires List. Her debut on this list with a net worth of $1.7bn makes her not just the world’s richest musician but also the richest person in her home country Barbados. Forbes wrote, “The company, which she co-owns with luxury conglomerate LVMH, reportedly raked in more than $550 million in revenue in 2020. “She also has a 30 percent stake in her Savage x Fenty lingerie line, which raised approximately $115 million in series B funding at a $1 billion valuation in early 2021.” Kanye ‘Ye’ West, on the other hand, snagged the 1513 spot with a net worth of 2$billion, which Forbes linked to his lucrative Yeezy partnership with Adidas and deal with Gap. Jay-Z also made his debut on the 2022 list at number 2,076 with a net worth of $1.4bn. Standing strong at the top of the list is Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, with an estimated worth of $219billion (£167bn). In second place is Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, worth almost $50bn (£38bn) less than Musk with $171bn (£130bn). The 2022 billionaire list included 2,668 billionaires with a collective worth of $12.7tn, a notable change from the 2775 billionaires listed last year who were collectively worth $13.1trillion.
