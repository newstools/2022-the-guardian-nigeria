House of Representatives, yesterday, berated Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mele Kyari, for refusing to appear before it over the organisation’s financial status. This resolution followed the failure of the GMD and heads of Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna refineries to appear before the House Ad-hoc Committee on State of Refineries in the country, yesterday, in Abuja. The lower legislative chamber is worried that the three refineries have been operating at loss since 2010 before being eventually shut down in 2019, consequent upon which the lawmakers constituted the committee to demand accountability. Chairman of the committee, Ganiyu Johnson, said: “It is worrisome that the GMD of the NNPC, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and the General Managers of Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna Refineries have refused three invitations to appear before the committee to account for the billions of dollars spent on the rehabilitation of the refineries over the years.”
