Two persons were killed when gunmen ambushed the convoy of the newly elected member representing Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency, Musa Agah on Tuesday night. It was gathered that the member was returning from Jebbu Bassa after a tour of the four Wards of Rukuba Chiefdom of Bassa local government council. The personal assistant to the lawmaker, Moses Maly, who was in the same car with him when the incident occurred said that the legislator’s wife and two kids were also together with him but all escaped while his car was shattered with bullets. Two persons who were on motorcycle including the People Democratic Party (PDP) Ward Chairman and Woman Leader who were ahead of the convoy were killed in the ambush, Maly added. The lawmaker was recently sworn–in as a member representing the Jos North/Bassa Federal Constituency following his victory on February 26, 2022 by-election. PDP State Publicity Secretary in Plateau State, John Akans, who spoke to journalists lamented the sad incident, saying that the people of Plateau are in danger . “It is sad that nowhere is safe in our state,” Akans said. “We are all living in hell.” Akans  also flayed as inexcusable, the failure of the  APC led Government to act upon early danger signs and threats by taking precautionary measures that could have averted incessant killings, particularly in the state . “We are really devastated by this rising ongoing massacre of innocent citizens in the State. This act of wickedness of humans against fellow humans has continued to spread freely as a result of the incompetence and nonchalant attitude of the APC,” he added.
