SIR: The recent suit filed by the former Attorney General and Minister of Justice,  Michael Aandoakaa urging a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja to review a judgment barring him from holding public office, a case already decided by the Supreme Court, is an action that must be properly dealt with in order to prevent a recurrence, and the best way out is to dismiss the man who initiated such a preposterous move from the association and his certificates withdrawn. It is sad that a person in the calibre of a former attorney general of a nation could be out to bring its judicial process into disrepute through a frivolous application and unless the body of benchers takes a serious action that can send a strong warning to all members, such arrant nonsense will continue to repeat itself and that will deal a devastating blow to Nigeria’s judiciary.
