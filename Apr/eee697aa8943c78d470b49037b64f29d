Manchester City drew 2-2 with Liverpool for the second time this season in a Premier League classic at the Etihad, reports theathletic.com. Before yesterday’s kick-off, the fixture had been described as a title decider with each team in lockstep as they racked up wins in their pursuit of the title. That equation has not changed, with City still leading Liverpool by one point with seven games remaining for each side. Raheem Sterling missed a glorious early chance for City, but Kevin De Bruyne atoned for his team-mate’s miss with a deflected finish after only five minutes. However, Liverpool responded almost immediately, with Trent Alexander-Arnold brilliantly cutting back for Diogo Jota to force the ball past Ederson. Both teams flirted with the opposition goal, with De Bruyne firing narrowly wide and Ederson taking risks near his own net, before Gabriel Jesus beat the Liverpool offside trap to give his team a 2-1 half-time lead. City failed to defend their lead after the restart. Mane raced onto a through ball to lash home after only 46 seconds of the second half, and Liverpool remained in the ascendancy afterwards. Yet, it appeared to be City who had restored their lead for a third time with 30 minutes remaining. Sterling raced through to convert past Alisson, only for VAR to rule the winger offside. Neither side could force a result in the closing stages, despite two chances for Riyad Mahrez. The substitute hit the post with a long-range free-kick before he spurned an opportunity for a famous winner after overhitting a chip. City remains fractionally ahead in their bid for a fourth Premier League title in five years.
