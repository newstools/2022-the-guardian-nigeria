The single “One chance” is infused with Igbo lyrics describing his love for a certain maiden. Most Nigerians know the thought of being caught in “one chance” situation will have you shiver with horror, but here, the newbie croons his admiration and how he would be with her regardless of the imminent danger of it. “Mary o, if your love na one chance o, i go enter o. Nga ebuligi n’obi o m ga agba cha the whole race,” he sings. His choice of language is nuanced and clean and doesn’t require pg (parents guidance). The track, one chance is produced by Smithzervybe and written by JA Mike.
