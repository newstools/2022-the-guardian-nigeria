 Ne-Yo and Crystal Renay | Image: Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for Ciroc Ne-Yo and his wife Crystal Renay have been remarried two years after filing for divorce.   The So Sick singer wedded the former reality star in an over-the-top wedding on a rooftop of the new Resorts World complex in Las Vegas on Sunday night. TMZ reports that the couple filled the venue with more than 10,000 red roses and ordered an eight-foot-tall cake with four different flavours. Their guests included former Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes and Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta alum Tammy Rivera. The news outlet also shared videos of the newly remarried couple dancing to Ed Sheeran’s Thinking Out Loud and Ne-Yo’s Miss Independent. In a post on Instagram earlier on Sunday, Ne-Yo revealed that he felt “honoured and beyond happy” to be in a good place with his wife again.   A post shared by NE-YO (@neyo) “This weekend means the world to me,” Renay added. The couple first got married in February 2016 but split after Ne-Yo filed for divorce in March 2020, which Renay claimed to have learned about on the internet. However, Ne-Yo soon withdrew the paperwork, explaining that they had reconciled while quarantining amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The duo share three children together; sons Shaffer and Roman and daughter Isabella, whom they welcomed in June 2021 after they reconciled.
