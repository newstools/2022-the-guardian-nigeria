The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), yesterday, picketed the corporate headquarters of a new generation bank in Lagos over alleged disobedience to a court order. According to the chairman, the Lagos branch of NLC, Olufunmilayo Shesi, in 2019, a Court case between Amalgamated Union of Public Corporation Civil Service and Recreational Service Employees (AUPCTRE) and Anambra State government was won over debt of salaries and other allowances due to Anambra State Environmental Protection Agency (ANSEPA) and Anambra State Water Corporation.
 
After the case was won, the court ordered a Garnishee against the state, but other banks complied except the bank “A 21-day ultimatum was served on them, yet no response.  Another seven days expired on Wednesday, April 13. Then we decided to picket their office,” she added.
