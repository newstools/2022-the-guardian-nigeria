Federal Government’s revised COVID-19 travel protocol for travellers arriving in Nigeria takes effect from today. Chairman of the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, disclosed this in a statement yesterday. The new protocol stipulates that inbound passengers to Nigeria who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 are no longer required to carry out the mandatory PCR test before boarding Nigeria-bound flights. Also, fully vaccinated passengers arriving Nigeria will not be required to carry out the post-arrival PCR or Rapid Antigen Tests. “Children below the age of 18 years will be accorded the same privileges as persons who are fully vaccinated,” the new protocol document said. However, inbound passengers, who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated for COVID-19, will still be required to take a PCR test 48 hours before departure and undergo Days Two and Seven post-arrival PCR tests at their own cost. All inbound passengers, regardless of vaccination status, are expected to register via the online Nigeria International Travel Portal. All passengers travelling out of Nigeria are “encouraged to have evidence of full vaccination against COVID-19; comply with COVID-19 guidelines of their destination or transit countries; and familiarise themselves with COVID-19 travel requirements of their destination and transit countries before embarking on a journey.”
