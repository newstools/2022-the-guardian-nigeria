DR. Ifeanyi Chukwuma Odii, yesterday, said that the major reason for his decision to contest for the governorship position of Ebonyi State is to tackle unemployment through wealth creation. In a chat with The Guardian in his country home, Isu, in Onicha Local Council of the State, Odii said that he will be contesting under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), noting that if elected as governor, his government would focus on wealth creation by way of creating jobs for the unemployed youths, so as to reduce social vices. While maintaining that he has the capacity to deliver, he added that his vast experiences in growing his business empires have given him the edge over other candidates promising Ebonyi people that he will not disappoint them. He said: “It is only God who knows the heart of any individual. For me, I am an Ebonyian. I am running for governorship because I am an Ebonyi man and not because I am from Ebonyi South, North or Central.”
What I believe is the capacity. Leadership is all about who can deliver.”
