Member representing Ikwo/Ezza Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Chinedu Ogah, has said betrayals to Governor David Umahi undid majority of Ebonyi State lawmakers on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the National Assembly. He disclosed that prior to his decision to join the APC, the governor and all other elected representatives decided to pitch tent with him politically on account of his performance in office. In an exclusive interview with The Guardian, Ogah, who has been endorsed by constituents for a second term in the Green Chamber, stated that none of the current members of the Ninth National Assembly could boldly claim that he was not elected on the popularity of Governor Umahi. Assuring that APC would clinch all National Assembly seats in the 2023 general elections, Ogah, who is the only APC lawmaker from Ebonyi State, said reality had dawned on the opposition that “they have nothing to campaign with to earn the people’s votes.” He stated: “You know the impending displacement is all about gains for our people. From your analysis on effective representation, can you show me any of my colleagues that will win in their constituency? Show me one person. “So, it is an opportunity for other people to come up. We know ourselves. We know how we came up. To be very frank, but for the betrayals from our people, none of them can stand to say that the governor has not done well for them. That is my take. “Irrespective of whatever had happened in the past, I treat everybody with compassion, irrespective of political party, my friend is my friend. That you are on a different party platform will not affect our good relationship, we still maintain that relationship. But betrayal is not good.”
