Download logo Following consultation with UEFA and the member associations concerned, FIFA (www.FIFA.com) can confirm the dates for the two remaining matches of the European qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off path involving Ukraine.  The European qualifying play-off between Scotland and Ukraine will be played on 1 June and the winners will face Wales on 5 June in the play-off final for the remaining European spot at football’s flagship event at the end of the year. The rescheduled fixtures have resulted in the UEFA Nations League calendar being adjusted for some of the games in order to accommodate the postponed play-off matches. FIFA would like to thank all of the parties involved for the strong spirit of solidarity and cooperation that has led to this unanimous decision. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of FIFA.
