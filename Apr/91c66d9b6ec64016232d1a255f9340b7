The Auditor-General for the Federation (AuGF), Adolphus Aghughu, has charged digital forensic auditors in Nigeria to be professional in the performance of their duties. Aghughu gave the charge, yesterday, in Abuja at the induction of new digital forensic auditors by the Computer Forensics Institute, Nigeria (CFIN). The Auditor-General, who himself was an inductee, along with 39 other personnel in his office, said that the Office of the Auditor-General of the Federation is now fully equipped both with human and technical resources to carry out its mandate effectively. He said: “We have a very functional digital forensic laboratory. This is so because, in the present age, we cannot run away from digital auditing because all our transactions are automated.” He advised the new inductees to make the best use of the training they have received for the good of the nation. Chairman, Computer Forensic Institute, Nigeria, Prof. Peter Olayiwola, said the challenge of digital forensic auditing in Nigeria is the lack of enough standard digital forensic laboratories. “We can count on our fingertips the number of digital forensic laboratories in the Nigerian Police Force and the military. At this time when the nation is facing serious and existential challenges because of insecurity, we cannot but adopt digital forensics to be able to battle crime and criminality. “I am, however, glad that the initial fear of adopting digital forensic auditing is fading away. In the judiciary, our judges are beginning to acquire knowledge of digital forensics. Even our military and other law enforcement agencies are keying into digital forensics,” he said. He called for the training of more professional digital forensic auditors because Nigeria, a country of over 200 million people, needs to have a good population of its citizens fully equipped with the knowledge. Also inducted were 50 officers of the Nigerian Police Force (NPF).
