Harry Maguire’s house was checked by police on Thursday after the Manchester United captain received a bomb threat. England defender Maguire, who lives with his fiancée and two children, has endured a difficult season with club and country, but it is not known who made the threat. The 29-year-old’s home was swept by Cheshire police to ensure his safety. “In the last 24 hours, Harry has received a serious threat to his family home,” a spokesman for Maguire said.

Maguire was part of the United team thrashed 4-0 at arch-rivals Liverpool on Tuesday. He is next due to play when United travel to Arsenal on Saturday for a crucial Premier League clash in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League. United, who have slipped to sixth in the Premier League, on Thursday announced the appointment of Ajax boss Erik ten Hag as their new manager from next season.
