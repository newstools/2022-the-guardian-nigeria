MTN Nigeria has launched a voice over long-term evolution (VoLTE) call service in line with its commitment to providing access to the best communications technology and improving the overall customer experience. The service also referred to as high definition (HD) calls provides customers who own compatible devices with superior natural-sounding voice quality, reduces background noise and increases the speed of call connectivity. Speaking about the new service, the Chief Marketing Officer of MTN Nigeria, Adia Sowho, said: “With VoLTE, MTN Nigeria continues to enhance Nigerian lives with innovative technology. VoLTE is free to access today at your rates from a VoLTE-enabled smartphone so you can call and surf at the same time with no interruptions ever again.” The MTN VoLTE call service will be charged at regular call rates. It will be available to all customers with VoLTE-enabled devices such as Tecno Phantom X, Infinix Zero X and Infinix Zero X Pro smartphones. Other device models from Samsung, Nokia, Apple and Tecno will be supported soon. To enjoy the service, customers only need to do three things – check that they have a 4G USIM; check that they are within a 4G coverage area by texting 4G to 131 and update their VOLTE smartphone to the latest software version.
