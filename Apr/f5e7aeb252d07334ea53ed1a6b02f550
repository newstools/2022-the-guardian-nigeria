 Bowie The biopic film Moonage Daydreamor which portrays the life of David Bowie has gotten official approval from his estate. Moonage Daydreamor was named after his 1972 hit song Moonage Daydream from his album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The film is co-produced by BMG and Live Nation Productions and directed by Brett Morgen who has significantly invested four years in the film’s project by going through archives of Bowie’s performances. Moonage Daydreamor will focus entirely on the late singer’s creativity and music career between 1970-and 1977 when he was yet to make global recognition. According to Brett, “The feature-length experiential cinematic odyssey that explores Bowie’s creative, musical and spiritual journey, is how it is being described. Told through sublime, kaleidoscopic, never-before-seen footage, performances, and music, the film is guided by Bowie’s narration and is the first film to be officially sanctioned by Bowie’s estate.” Since his death on 10th January 2016, his archives have been preserved with utmost care with some unfinished works he began when he was alive. Unlike other films, The Rise & Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars that were denied full access to the estate Mopnage Daydreamor has full access including archives and music, which could perhaps give better insight while working on Moonage Daydreamor. David Bowie was the husband of model and entrepreneur Iman Abdulmajid.
