 Selena Gomez Selena Gomez has said that she has been away from the internet for four years and a half years.   Being the most followed celebrity in 2016, the former Disney star said in an interview that her withdrawal from the internet has “Changed my life completely.’’ She says “I am happier, I am more present, I connect more with people,” Gomez said. “I understand how powerful the internet is, and in so many ways it’s done the best things for the world. But for me, I get news that is actually important. I get through people in my life.” The singer and producer, presently with over 300 million followers on Instagram says “There are places where people go when they need help, and it’s unfortunate that they cost ridiculous amounts of money,” Gomez said. “But [as with] Planned Parenthood, there’s a place for women to feel okay and to feel understood, and I want that for mental health.” Selena Gomez founded a mental health platform that she is promoting, and has been outspoken about her struggles with bipolar disorder.
