The Tennis Section of the Ikoyi Club, Lagos, has announced that it will host a tennis clinic for youths in the forthcoming Easter holiday period. The five-day clinic and tournament have been scheduled to start on April 19 at the club to boost the Easter season for the young ones. Captain of the Tennis Section, Ekene Nwakolo, yesterday, said the tournament will be for players from the ages of five to 16. “Everything is set. We expect the young ones to learn more and have a good time during the clinic/tournament. Our aim is to produce future stars because once they know the foundation, they can get better with keen interest,” Nwakolo said. The chairman of the Tennis Section, Akeem Mustafa, enjoined parents to support their kids to actualise their potential in sports generally. “What we are doing is a foundational programme that could be the beginning to stardom for some of these young ones. We thank our sponsors, Leadway Assurance, for supporting us to arrange this for the kids,” Mustafa stated.
