NSIA MD: Compensation Ongoing The Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, has expressed optimism that the completion and inauguration of the Second Niger Bridge, scheduled for the third quarter of this year, will boost trade and commercial activities in the South South and South East geopolitical zones.
 
Ahmed, after an inspection tour of the project, along with the Managing Director of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), Mr. Uche Orji, and Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Gilbert Ibezim, as well as top officials of the ministry and the contractors, yesterday, stated that the bridge was designed to uplift the lives of the people of the South South and South East.
   
“Today is a very significant day in the construction circle of the Second Niger Bridge, which is one of the most iconic projects in the country put at an initial project cost of N205b. Today, we have expanded this project to the tune of N157b.  Orji explained that the Presidential Development Fund is managed by NSIA, which has put in its own funds and some monies from the recovered Abacha loot; hence the funding is by the federal government and NSIA, adding: “So, it is purely the federal government and NSIA that is the face of the project.”
 
NSIA is an investment institution owned by the federal, states and local governments, as well as shareholders. 
He stated that compensation is an ongoing affair, noting: “We have paid significant sums earlier and there are more yet to be paid in some areas as we continue work.
