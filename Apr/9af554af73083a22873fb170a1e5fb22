The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has assured motorists and Premium Motor Spirit users in the Southeast that there would be a regular supply of products during Easter. Mr Chinedu Anyaso, the IPMAN Chairman, Enugu depot community in charge of Anambra, Ebonyi and Enugu gave the assurance in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Saturday. The IPMAN chairman said that people should not panic because members in the zone had products at the outlets. According to him, a good number of trucks are loading at the depots and, under the current supply, there is nothing that will lead to product shortage. “There is no shortage of product now, our members have enough products and more are on the way; so nobody should panic, transporters should not take undue advantage of travellers in the name of petrol scarcity,” he said. Anayaso, however, said it was regrettable that markets in the zone had relied on depots outside the zone for sourcing products for more than 15 years when the Enugu depot went moribund. He said that marketers in the zone had faced additional operational challenges associated with long-distance and bad road while transporting products from Lagos, Warri and Calabar. He urged the Federal Government to reactivate the Enugu depot to ease the challenges of downstream operators in the zone. He also called on governors of the Southeast to support the siting of tank farms and the building of refineries in the region.
