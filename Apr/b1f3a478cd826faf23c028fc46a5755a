Demand release of Catholic priest
The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID), yesterday, condemned the recent attack on a community harbouring some victims of the massacre in Effium community, in Ohaukwu Local Government Area of Ebonyi state. AESID President, Ambassador Paschal Oluchukwu, in a statement, urged Governor Dave Umahi-led government to bring the perpetrators of the dastardly act to justice. AESID remarked that it was unfortunate that the Governor Umahi-led administration has not lived up to its responsibility to protect lives and properties of the citizenry in the state. The diaspora association, therefore, challenged the Umahi-led government in the state to explain the rationale behind the release of 31 remanded Uffiom youths arrested with various guns and other weapons after unleashing mayhem on an Ezza settlement in Effium recently. The diaspora group demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the remanded Catholic Priest by security agencies within 48 hours.
