Following last week’s directive by the Federal Government for the reopening of four more borders, the Controller-General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Col. Hammed Ali (rtd), yesterday, reopened the Kamba Border. Ali, who was represented by the Kebbi State Area Controller, Joseph Attah, said the reopening of the border is to sustain the economy and security in the area. “This is to make sure that businesses impact on the economy. People should follow the Customs’ extant laws,” he said. Urging smugglers to use genuine and valid licence for smooth business activities in the area, he added: “Kamba is among the borders the Federal Government gave directive to be reopened. Today, we have done that and it is not made for any illegal activity.” Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu, commended President Muhammad Buhari for reopening the Kamba border. Represented by the Commissioner for Commerce and Industries, Garba Geza, the governor expressed his administration’s readiness to support the Customs area command in sustaining the Federal Government’s directive and ensure smooth business activities in the state. He then admonished border agents to follow due process in their business activities. The District Head of Kamba, Alh. Mamudu Fanna, who also expressed appreciation to the President for reopening the border, promised to sustain the Federal Government’s directive by following due process in import and export.
