Sir: It is elections year; politicians are at it again and political campaigns have started even when the referee has not blown the whistle for the campaign to start. I want to sound a note of warming to all Nigerians. The super propagandists are at what they know best. They have the resources and they control radio and television stations. They can go on air 24 hours a day, dishing out figures that look like facts.  The NET building and other property of Nigerian External Communication are now in private hands. They are all politicians. Their target is to make other Nigerians slaves in their own country.  They baited most Nigerians to rush to purchase their stock at 50 kobo, but the stock is now less than 2 kobo at the Stock Exchange. The shareholders associations have been compromised. Corruption has eaten deep into various associations and they are not operating with the principles. Chief Akintunde Asalu set up the first shareholders association in the country. No Annual General Meeting of Shareholders since the past five to 10 years or so. All the government agencies have been compromised. God will judge Nigeria. Dr. Sunday O. Ajai.
