Ten All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirants in Rivers State have signed a pact to support whoever emerges as the party’s standard-bearer in 2023 general election. The Chibuike Amaechi-led faction of the party in the state had insisted the governorship ticket would go to the riverine area. Riverine communities and the  Ogoni people have been clamouring for the number one seat for the sake of equity and justice , saying the upland has held power since  1999 when former  Governor  Peter Odili governed the  State. The governorship aspirants, who are mostly from the riverine axis of the state include  Dr. Dakuku  Peterside, Dr. Dawari George,  Tonye Cole , Prince Tonye Princewill and Dr. Sokonte Davies. Others are Biokpomabo Awara, Francis Ebenezer Ada, Mina Tender, Ojukaye Flag-Amachree and Ibinabo Micheal-West. A communiqué issued, yesterday, in Port Harcourt after an indoor meeting, noted that the aspirants also agreed to go about their consultations in a peaceful and civil manner. The communiqué reads: “The progressives’ aspirants agreed that all aspirants should go about their consultations in a peaceful and civil manner; avoiding name-calling, insults and pulling down other aspirants to gain attention. Aspirants also agreed to caution their supporters and social media aides from attacking aspirants from opposing camps. “The progressives’ aspirants to work in unity and support whoever emerges at the party primaries either by way of consensus or election as exemplified by the party leadership at the just-concluded national convention.” “The progressives’ aspirants called on the party leadership to ensure a level-playing field for all aspirants during the primaries to give everyone a sense of belonging, fairness and equity.”
