The national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Abdullahi Adamu on Tuesday formally resigned from the Senate. Senator Abubakar Kyari representing Borno North also resigned from the Upper Chamber. Adamu late March was elected APC chairman during the party’s National Convention in Abuja by consensus. The former two-term governor of Nasarawa State, emerged as the party’s consensus candidate after six other aspirants reluctantly withdrew from the race hours into the convention. Adamu officially assumed office by receiving instruments of office from the immediate-past interim chairman of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mala Buni, at the party’s national headquarters in Abuja. In his address at the ceremony, attended by one of his predecessors, John Oyegun, and other elected National Working Committee (NWC) executives, the new APC chairman said he never thought he would be the party chairman 30 days to the convention.
