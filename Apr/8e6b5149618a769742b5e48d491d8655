Another bomb planted by terrorists was yesterday discovered by residents of Shanono area of Rigasa community in Igabi local council of the Kaduna State. Kaduna  Yesterday’s discovery was the second in Rigasa after last Tuesday’s attack on train passengers. Incidentally, the community plays host to the train station in the state. The anti-bomb squad of the state Police Command had deactivated the device discovered last Thursday and no casualty was recorded. A resident, Tijjani Umar, told journalists that children in the community discovered the fresh object in a jerrycan covered with a black nylon. He said it was placed very close to a stream in the community. “It was kept at the same spot where the Thursday IED was discovered. We don’t know what is happening in this community. It was my sister-in-law that rushed to inform me that the children found another bomb inside a jerrycan,” he said. Spokesman of the state Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the development, saying the anti-bomb squad team had been mobilised to the area. “The area has been cordoned off so as to protect the people from getting hurt while our men are there to defuse the device,” he said. He urged people of the area to be more vigilant as they go about their lawful duties.
