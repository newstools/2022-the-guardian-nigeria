   Parents, coaches and guardians of budding tennis players have been turning up at the club to register their wards for the clinic expected to start tomorrow. While children of club members pay N3, 000 for registration, non-members are paying 5, 000 to be part of the five-day event.
The yearly junior tennis tournament is organised for boys and girls between the ages of five and 16 with support from Leadway Assurance Company. Chairman, Tennis Section, Akeem Mustafa, said at the weekend that the registration for the event has shown that it would be a huge fun for the participants. “The more players we have, the better for the kids and also the atmosphere. We are happy with the huge response of the parents for the clinic so far, which means the clinic would be exciting,” Mustafa said. Captain of the tennis section, Ekene Nwaokolo, also said that arrangements were in top gear for the start of the clinic, adding that some club members, who travelled out of Lagos, made calls to register their wards for the tennis clinic/tournament. In the 2021 edition of the junior tennis tournament, Benjamin Okoronkwo defeated Tele Orungbenja 7/5, 10/8 to emerge champion in the Boys U-16 event, while Modupe Akinyemi defeated Omosofe Akpata 7/3, 7/4 in the girls U-16 category.
