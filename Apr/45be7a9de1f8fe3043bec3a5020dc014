Former Nigerian Taekwondo Federation (NTF) President, George Ashiru, has lauded Christ College, Lagos, for its commitment to sporting activities, which, he said, has made the school unique. Ashiru, who urged other schools to emulate the college’s efforts at building talents and ‘catching them young,’ was the guest speaker at the 10th yearly inter-house sports competition at the college’s sports complex The Commonwealth Taekwondo Association vice president, who was represented by retired Assistant Commissioner of Police and President, Taekwondo Supporters’ Club of Nigeria, Gideon Akinsola, said: “A sound mind leaves in a sound body. I, therefore, encourage other schools to add sports activities in their curricula. Exposing the young ones to sports will help detect their inherent talents and potential. “As a sports administrator, I have realised that everybody has one gift or the other. These could be physical, mental and spiritual. And the best way to realise these potential gift is by catching them young.” Also speaking at the event, Chairman, Board of Governors of the College, Pastor Samuel O. Olatunji, said: “In Christ College, every child’s uniqueness is explored. We improve on uniqueness of the children to meet up with both physical and academic demand.” Olatunji lamented the state of education in the country, saying, “it is lack of attentiveness of successive administrations to the sector. And the only way to right this wrong is when the people begin to hold government and political leaders accountable.” At the end of the event, Blue House emerged the overall winner champions.
