Troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have neutralised the commander of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), Abubakar Dan-Buduma, and 19 other fighters in Borno State. Dan-Buduma and his lieutenants were eliminated in an intelligence-led and coordinated aerial and ground bombardment by the Nigerian Air Task Force, under Operation Hadin Kai, and the Multi-National Joint Task Force in Kwalaram Village, in Marte Local Council of the state. 
  
Dan-Buduma, who had replaced Muhammed Ba’ana, was the ISWAP’s Chief Naval Officer commanding the waterways of Kirta, Bakassi, Buningil, and Doron Buhari, in Marte Council.
  
A security analyst and expert, Zagazola Makama, who made the disclosure, yesterday, in Maiduguri, confirmed that the deceased was appointed in January this year to replace Ba’ana as the naval commanding officer in the lake.
