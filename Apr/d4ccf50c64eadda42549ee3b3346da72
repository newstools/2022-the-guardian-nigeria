Professor Akinjide Osuntokun is the youngest of the Osuntokun brothers from the same mother. Today, he is the lone survivor, the patriarch of the Osuntokun clan who, for almost a century, has been part of our history. Osuntokun chooses to be an historian, but he is also a part of our living history for he was an eyewitness and participant in some of the more turbulent aspects of our contemporary history.   
  
Now at 80, he would reflect and would be full of gratitude to benevolent fortune that, despite the toss and twist of life, has made him victorious and in relatively good health. He is now an old man witnessing the struggles and progress of his children, grandchildren and the newer generations of the Osuntokun clan.
  
Professor Osuntokun is a man of omnivorous interests. We grew up to know him even before he became my in-law, being the uncle of my late wife, Adekemi.  I first met him in 1984 when he came to Okemesi with his young children and Aunty Biodun, his wife. He was then a young professor at the University of Maiduguri, where Professor Jubril Aminu, an old student of the University of Ibadan Medical School, was the vice chancellor. Osuntokun, who read history at Ibadan for his first degree, has adopted Ibadan, the old Yoruba war camp, as his second home. We struck it off immediately and since then, he has become the favourite among the Osuntokun boys who dominated our childhood years.
