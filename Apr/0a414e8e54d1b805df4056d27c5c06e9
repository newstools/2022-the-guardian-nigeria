The Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) has deployed her leading groundsmen to Achimota to provide technical support to the Ghana Cricket Association (GCA), who are upgrading its top facilities ahead of the All Africa Games next year. Cricket has been approved to feature in the continental sports fiesta for the first time and that has put pressure on GCA to upgrade the facilities for the occasion. Nigeria’s Francis Ategeka and Yemi Amusa were at the Achimota College Cricket Oval, where their expertise was required for the upgrade and the reconstruction of the playing turfs ahead of the games. NCF President, Uyi Akpata, said the gesture is part of the ongoing collaborations between the various cricket bodies across the region, adding that cricket’s success at the All Africa Games is for all. “Our groundsmen’s successes with our facilities can help Ghana get their facilities in the best shape with minimal cost and also help upskill their groundsmen as well,” Akpata said. Two grounds inside Achimota College are presently being prepared and, according to Yemi Amusa, who also superintends over the Tafawa Balewa Square and University of Lagos Cricket Ovals, each of the pitches is being laid for four and six strips. “The hardcore, granite and sand have been laid and a very good clay source had been identified, but the regressing and the other technical bit have equally been scheduled. I think the grounds will come up well and better than expected,” he added. Nigeria’s growth has provided leverage for a number of regional bodies growth, including Sierra Leone and Cameroun, who are also counting on NCF for expertise, equipment and development partnership.
