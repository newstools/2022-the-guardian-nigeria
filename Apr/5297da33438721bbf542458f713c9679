The United Kingdom (UK) has expressed commitment to support the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the world’s largest free trade area initiative.
   
The International Trade Secretary, UK, Anne-Marie Trevelyan who announced the initiative said the programme (of up to £35m support to AfCFTA) is expected to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty, create jobs, and provide new commercial opportunities for businesses across Africa and the UK.
   
Trevelyan revealed this as the Secretary General of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Wamkele Mene, visits London to discuss how the UK can continue its work as a strategic partner to the trading bloc.  Secretary General of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Wamkele Mene said: “We are pleased to receive this support from the Government of the UK, as it ushers us into a partnership for strengthening cooperation related to customs and trade facilitation and trade policy across the African continent.
   
“In the last five years or so, we have seen the re-engineering of our Regional Economic Communities, to take into consideration the aspirations that are embedded in the AfCFTA instruments. We have also witnessed during this period the enthusiasm and the energy of our private sector to rise to the occasion and begin to exploit what is provided for in the Agreement.
