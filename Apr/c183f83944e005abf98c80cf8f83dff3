Protests have continued to trail the commencement of tolling on the Lekki-Ikoyi Link Bridge, which was suspended after the tolling device was damaged during the #EndSARS crisis in 2020. 
  
Over one year after toll collection was stopped, the state government and its concessionaire, Lekki Concession Company Limited (LCC), in the penultimate week, announced April 1 for the re-commencement of tolling, a development, which was kicked against by many, including motorists who ply the route, activists that took part in the protest, as well as residents of the Lekki-Ajah corridor.       
  
This is not the first time that the tolling of the bridge is generating controversy. A similar scenario played out when the facility was completed and about to commence tolling. Then, motorists and residents, especially those living on the Lekki and Ikoyi corridor also protested the development.
