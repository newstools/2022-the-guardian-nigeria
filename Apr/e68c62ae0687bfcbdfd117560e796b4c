 Ben king being examined and Johnny Depps’s defamation trial After Depp finished testifying, his attorneys called as a witness Ben King, an Englishman who managed the home where the couple stayed in Australia during the 2015 filming of the fifth instalment of the “Pirates” franchise. Much of the testimony at the trial has revolved around an incident that occurred there in which the tip of the middle finger of Depp’s right hand was severed. Depp told the jury it happened when Heard threw a vodka bottle at him, smashing the finger against the edge of a bar in the house. Heard’s lawyers suggested that Depp cut it with a knife in the kitchen. King’s testimony appeared to back up Depp’s account. The house manager said he found the severed fingertip in a tissue on the floor of the bar along with a broken bottle of Stolichnaya vodka. He said a “big chunk” of the marble bartop had been broken off. King said that while he had witnessed frequent arguments between the couple during their stay in Australia, and another in London, he had never seen them be violent. Testifying last week, Depp said the allegations that he was a “drunken, cocaine-fueled menace who beat women” have cost him “everything.” The actor said that a “couple of days” after the Post column appeared, Disney announced he would no longer appear as Captain Jack Sparrow in the blockbuster “Pirates” franchise Depp filed the defamation complaint in the United States after losing a separate libel case in London in November 2020 that he brought against The Sun for calling him a “wife-beater.”
