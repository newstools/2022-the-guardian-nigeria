ARM Group has partnered Greentec Capital to announce the commencement of the ARM Labs innovation programme in the Nigerian market. Formerly known as LABS by ARM Accelerator Programme and changed to ARM Labs Innovation Programme, the initiative is designed to support ARM’s mission to fund compelling Nigerian fintech startups in the incubation stage. Benefiting startups should be poised to solve key problems in innovative ways within the financial industry and introduce ideas that can transform how users access financial services. Through the programme, ARM will support selected startups to commercialise and grow in product or service lines. During the seven-week innovation programme, each participating fintech startup will be engaged intensively in a series of activities including advisory and mentorship sessions amongst others to exponentially advance its growth. The ARM Group will make an investment of $50,000 for six per cent of equity in each of the five selected startups and provide them with an office workspace to assist them in achieving their goals.
