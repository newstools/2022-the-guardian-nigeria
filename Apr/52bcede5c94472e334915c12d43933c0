The LA Galaxy are reportedly in talks to sign Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong on loan from English Premier League side Watford. The Nigeria international helped the Hornets to promotion from the EFL Championship after joining from Italian side Udinese last season and was a regular at the beginning of this campaign, starting 18 of Watford’s first 21 Premier League matches. But the center-back has lost his place since heading to the Africa Cup of Nations as Nigeria captain, failing to play a single Premier League game since returning. On Tuesday, CBS Sports’ Roger Gonzalez reported the Galaxy were in talks with Watford over a possible loan deal to bring Troost-Ekong to Los Angeles. Watford denied the two clubs were in contact over the following hours, but according to 90min, citing sources, the Galaxy are looking to push ahead with a loan deal. The MLS transfer window remains open until May 4, giving the clubs plenty of time to agree a deal, while the secondary window opens just over two months later on July 7. Should he depart the Premier League for the MLS, Troost-Ekong would add valuable depth and quality to the Galaxy’s centre-back options. At the moment, Galaxy head coach Greg Vanney has just three central defenders at his disposal: Nick DePuy, Sega Coulibaly, and Derrick Williams. LA Galaxy have made a positive start to the 2022 season and sit third in the Western Conference with nine points from five games.
