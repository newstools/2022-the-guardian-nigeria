The result of Bayern Munich’s 4-1 win at Freiburg last weekend will stand as the German FA (DFB) on Friday dismissed the hosts’ appeal after the Bundesliga leaders had briefly played with 12 men following a substitution mix-up. Bayern had an extra man on the pitch for 18 seconds last Saturday after two players came on, but only one came off, leading to Freiburg lodging an appeal on Monday. The sports court of the German Football Association (DFB) has ruled Bayern were not at fault for the mix-up, but said the error was down to the “misconduct” of the match officials. The decision means Bayern retain their nine-point lead and look set for a tenth straight Bundesliga title.
