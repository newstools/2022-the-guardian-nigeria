 Wizkid Made In Lagos superstar, Wizkid lost both nominations at the 2022 Grammy awards.   Wizkid was nominated in the Best Global Music Performance category, recognising new vocal or instrumental Global music recordings. He also received a second nomination in the Best Global Music Album category for albums containing at least 51% playing time of new vocal or instrumental Global Music recordings. However, the singer lost both nominations as the Best Global Music Performance award was won by Arooj Aftab, Mohabbat, while Angelique Kidjo, Mother Nature, won the Best Global Music Album category. His loss comes as a surprise to many who had predicted a double win for the singer in both categories. The 64th Grammy Awards is being held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas today, Sunday, April 3.
