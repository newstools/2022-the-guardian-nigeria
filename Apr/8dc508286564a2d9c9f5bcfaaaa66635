Speaking of the event, former international and 2017 Afrobasket silver medallist, Kelechi Anuna, said, “The tournament initiative is to provide hope and a sense of belonging for the Southeast and South-South youths. After the last edition in December, I knew that we needed to bring more national team players back to support. We are fortunate that many wanted to support basketball in Nigeria,” he said. Anuna, who recently commissioned a basketball court in Imo State, added that seeing sports stars going back to their communities to build basketball courts and football pitches, while growing up, gave him the motivation to give back to society. “As I grew older, and saw the state of basketball facilities and infrastructure in the east compared to other regions in Nigeria, I knew I had to do something. Every time I come home, I see the same thing year after year. Instead of waiting, I said the time is now, which led to the recent basketball court renovation in Owerri, where this competition will hold,” he said. He assured that there are more plans and developmental programmes in progress to revive basketball in Imo State, Southeast, and other parts of Nigeria with the support of the Kelechi Anuna Foundation.
