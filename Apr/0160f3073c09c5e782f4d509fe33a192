To further protect intellectual properties, the Senate, yesterday, passed a bill to allow for holistic review of Nigeria’s extant copyright law. The exercise is to strengthen the provision of policy and legal framework for the effective regulation, protection and administration of copyright in line with global best practices. The proposed piece of legislation tagged, “A Bill For An Act To Repeal The Copyright Act CAP LFN 2004 And To Re-enact The Copyright Act 2021,” was sponsored by Senator Adetokunbo Abiru (Lagos East). The passage was subsequent to the consideration of a report by the Joint Committee on Trade and Investment and Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters. Co-chair, Senator Saidu Ahmed Alkali (Gombe North), in his presentation, said the bill essentially seeks to strengthen the copyright regime in Nigeria to enhance the competitiveness of its creative industries in a digital and knowledge-based global economy. To the lawmaker, the re-enactment would effectively protect the rights of authors to ensure equitable rewards and recognition for their intellectual efforts. He, however, stated that the legislation would also provide appropriate limitations and exceptions to guarantee access to creative works, encourage cultural interchange and advance public welfare. He explained that “the proposed legislation makes online/digital reproduction an infringement, as well as properly defines copy to accommodate transient or non-permanent ones obtainable online.”
