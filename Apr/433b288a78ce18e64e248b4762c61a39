The Yoruba World Centre has shifted the launch of its language millionaire contest from May to July in honour of the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III. Alaafin was the chairman at the launching of the Centre. In a statement signed by its Co-ordinator, Alao Adedayo, the board and the management team of the centre felt they could not bring themselves together to organise such huge ceremony just a month after the death of the foremost custodian of Yoruba history, arts and culture, who was the one who had chosen the period of the launching. “The passing on of Alaafin is a personal loss. He was the first to be consulted once the formation of the Centre was agreed upon, and he keyed into the project. He also promised that he would use all resources at his disposal to ensure its success. He said he was proud of it and would see to its completion. “Alaafin Adeyemi was not just an Oba of Oyo, but a father to all Yoruba people. He was the embodiment of history, a repertoire with large resources, an Alaafin that oozed out our culture in all his speeches, actions and comportment. When you meet Alaafin, you have met a complete Yoruba in everything,” the statement stated. “We sincerely condole with the Yoruba people, particularly the governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde and other South-West governors, our revered royal fathers, people of Oyo and the immediate family of our father. No doubt, his demise will create such a gap that can’t be filled in decades. Who is going to dance like him? Who is going to chant like him? Who is going to relate Yoruba history with dates and data off hand? Who is going to promote the Yoruba royal ways of dressing like Oba Adeyemi? The gap may continue to grow wider,” the statement concluded.
