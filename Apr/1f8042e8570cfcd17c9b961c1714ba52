Golfers from across the country have been registering in large numbers for this year’s DStv Premium Golf Day, which will hold at the Ikeja Golf Club, Lagos, on Saturday. The competition, which debuted two years ago, is also supported by soft drinks bottling giant, Pepsi. Flykite Production, organisers of the event, in a statement, yesterday, noted that interest in the event has exceeded expectations, attracting about 600 registrants, who will battle for the three bumper prizes on the table. The first prize is a business class flight ticket to Dubai for a weekend stay in a five-star hotel, with the second being a business class ticket to Kigali, Rwanda, for a weekend stay at a five-star hotel. The third prize is a weekend five-star hotel stay in Lagos. According to the organisers, 100 golfers will be selected for participation from the about 600 registrants for the event, which will be played with only four clubs and a putter with winners emerging via a stroke play format. At the maiden edition, Dr. Ogunbiyi Ogunbanjo of Ikeja Golf Club, Messrs. Remi Olukoya and Rasheed Adebisi won the first, second and third prizes respectively.
