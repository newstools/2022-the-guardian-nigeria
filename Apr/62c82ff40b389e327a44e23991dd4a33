Plateau State Police Command has arrested two mobile officers whose photographs went viral on social media as they were forcefully collecting bribes along Kadarko Road in Wase Council of the state.
 
The Guardian learnt that the officers from 66 PMF have been detained and undergoing police trials.  “The state’s  Commissioner of Police, Batholomew  Onyeka, in line with his anti-corruption policy thrust, vows to deal ruthlessly and to get rid of criminally-minded personnel who fall short of ethical standards under his administration.”
 
The commissioner, he said,  further appreciated members of the public for their swift action, urging them to continue to expose the unprofessional conduct of members of the force to sanitise the system and have a Police Force to be proud of.
