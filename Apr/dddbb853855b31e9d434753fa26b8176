REMA Taking to his social media, the Dumebi crooner lamented that since he got admission into the University of Lagos, which he announced earlier this year, he has been unable to attend any classes. “ASUU, since dem give me admission I neva start school o, e don do nau!” he wrote in Pidgin.
Recall that Rema announced in January that, upon his mother’s insistence, he sought and gained admission into the creative arts department of the University of Lagos. His decision to further his education was greeted with positive sentiments by his fans across the country. Other superstars such as Davido, Naeto C, Kizz Daniel, among others have similarly toed the line of music, alongside completing their first degrees in university. Rema’s outcry is coming days after students under the aegis of the National Association of University Students, Osun Campus Monitoring Committee, called on the Federal Government and striking lecturers to return to the negotiation table, and resolve their disagreement. According to ASUU, the strike was due to Federal Government’s failure to implement the agreement between both parties, signed in 2009. ASUU had also accused the Federal Government of working against the deployment of the University Transparency and Accountability Solution, a payment platform designed by the union in place of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System by the Federal Government.
