The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has named Shell as a “leading tax compliant organisation in Nigeria for 2021.”
 
At an award ceremony in Abuja, as part of the second annual National Tax Dialogue, Shell companies in Nigeria also won the award for ‘remarkable performance in the remittance of various taxes’ in the same year.
 
The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) and Shell Nigeria Gas paid a combined $6 billion in direct taxes between 2015 and 2020 to the government.
   
The Executive Chairman of the FIRS, Mr. Muhammad Mamman Nami, noted that Shell companies demonstrated commitment to paying all government taxes hence the two awards.  Okunbor, who was represented by a director of the SPDC and General Manager, Business Government Relationship, Bashir Bello, said Shell companies would remain committed to expanding their gas portfolio for domestic and export market while also increasing access to energy for Nigerians.”
