Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has commiserated with the former President of the Senate, Adolphus Wabara, on the passing of his wife, Felicia Wabara. Mrs. Wabara reportedly died on April 10, 2022 at 69, while battling a protracted illness. In a statement by his Chief Press Secretary/ Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, the governor said he shared Wabara’s pains because of his relationship with the family. The governor regretted that Mrs. Wabara’s passing had suddenly thrown the family members, those of her friends and associates, into unexpected mourning, and implored the senator, his children and other family members to be strong in their faith and believe in God to take control of whatever challenge they were passing through. While also commiserating with the government and people of Abia, Uzodimma assured that his family, the government and people of Imo would continue to remember Mrs. Wabara and those that survived her in their prayers. The governor specifically prayed God to grant Mrs. Wabara the strength, courage and fortitude to bear the pains the exit of his better half brought upon him and his family.
