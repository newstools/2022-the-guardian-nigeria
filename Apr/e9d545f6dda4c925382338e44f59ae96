 Vox. Miles Morales and the rest of the Spider-folks in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Sony has announced a new date for Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse a sequel of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The new date being June 2nd, 2023 sets the film eight months behind the initial schedule of October 7th. This delay in the anticipated film was made known via the film’s official Twitter account which read, ‘‘Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is now scheduled for release on June 2nd, 2023, rather than October 7th this year.’’ This will be the third shift as Sony had originally noted that the Spider-Verse sequel would be released in April 2022. It is however not certain what might be the reason for the production delay but writer and producer Christopher Miller posted a tweet that suggests it is for the best ‘‘More time to make it great.’’ Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse becomes the first out of two sequels Sony plans in its animated Spider-Man film series and the second part is scheduled for release on March 29th, 2024. The animated sequels are the latest live-action Spider-Man film featuring Tom Holland in Spider-Man: No Way Home which was the highest-grossing movie of last year. The expected film will again follow the multiversal adventures of Miles Morales played by Shameik Moore. Come back actors set to voice the film are Oscar Isaac, Hailee Steinfeld, and Jake Johnson with Issa Rae joining the cast as Spider-Woman.
