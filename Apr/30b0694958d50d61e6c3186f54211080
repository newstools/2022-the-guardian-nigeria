The chances of Princess Olatorera Majekodunmi-Oniru representing Ogun Central Senatorial District in the Senate have been boosted by the declaration of the current occupant of the seat, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, that he would contest the 2023 presidential election. Amosun, a former governor of Ogun State, had in a letter within the week informed the Senate of his intention to vie for the highest office in the land. The development was cheery news to supporters of Majekodunmi-Oniru who have since doubled their efforts towards helping her to realise her senatorial ambition. The aspirant is an Egba descendant of the popular Majekodunmi family. She got married in 2012 to Prince Adedapo Oniru of the Oniru Royal Family in a grand ceremony in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. While sharing her vision as contained in her manifesto at a meeting with media stakeholders recently, she said: “I am working for us and fully ready to represent Ogun Central Senatorial District in the Upper Chamber of our National Assembly.” Primaries are set for May 18, 2022. Our push for greater Nigeria will be achieved; one great leader elected after another. We will advocate and establish strong laws and institutions with checks and balances to propel our developing economy with every citizen well accounted for. “Together, we will push our dreams of greater Nigeria, starting yesterday, starting now. Together, we will achieve greater Nigeria with each passing day, each passing election. Greater Nigeria is achievable; greater Nigeria is a must. We must increase the standard of living. We must have a stable electricity supply. We must capitalise on our agricultural growth potential and we must ensure the highest quality primary, secondary and tertiary education for each and every citizen.”
