NLNG Ship Management Limited (NSML) has secured the terminal’s Ecoport Port Environmental Review System (PERS) certification, making it the first in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to get the certification. NSML, a subsidiary of Nigeria LNG Limited, provides a wide range of maritime and shipping services ranging from manning, fleet management, training, terminal management and maritime consultancy to project management. According to the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of NSML, Abdukadir Ahmed, the certification is an attestation that NLNG’s Bonny terminal operation complies with leading environmental management practices. “Our operations are guided by our commitment to the environment, decarbonisation and ultimately sustainability. This achievement tells the story of our conscious effort to secure the future and at the same time, contribute to the development of the maritime sector in our country. For us at NSML, this is the new standard, and we shall not relent to maintain this certification,” Ahmed stated. He added that the certification was earned through proactive work by the NSML terminal management team in applying global standards in port/terminal environmental management and imbibing a culture of continuous improvement. He stated further that the milestone has conferred on NSML and NLNG a pioneer status, making them thought leaders in managing safe and environmentally-friendly port and terminal operations. The Ecoport Port Environmental Review System (PERS) certification is the only port sector-specific environmental management standard, mainly achieved by leading ports/terminals globally.
