The Federal Government has rejected the 2021 World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) that identified Nigeria as a country not conducive to journalism practice. Rejecting the index, it argued that the Nigerian press is among the most vibrant and freest in the world. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made the government’s position known in Abuja when he received the executive members of International Press Institute (IPI) Nigeria in his office, yesterday. The President of IPI Nigeria, Mr. Muskilu Mojeed, who led the delegation, had cited the WPFI as an example of the country’s low rating in the area of press freedom. Describing the IPI assessment as lacking empirical verification, the minister said: “I disagree with your assessment of press freedom under this government. Honestly, at times when I read what the media write here about Nigeria, I begin to wonder whether I live in the same country they are writing about. I disagree vehemently with the assessment because it is unfounded and has no scientific basis. I have been the Minister of Information and Culture since 2015, so I know the state of press freedom in Nigeria.” Mohammed stated that some people misconstrued government’s efforts to ensure a responsible use of social media as an attempt to tamper with press freedom or threaten independent journalism, emphasising that “the government does not harbour such intention.”
