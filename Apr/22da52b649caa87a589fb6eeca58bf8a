President Muhammadu Buhari has mandated the Minister of Agriculture, Mohammad Abubakar, to immediately release grains to cushion the effect of the rising food prices, especially during the Easter and Ramadan period. Briefing newsmen after he met with the president, Abubakar said over 40 metric tonnes of grains would be released from the Strategic Grains Reserves (SGR).
 
He said the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development would facilitate the distribution of 12,000 metric tonnes of the various grains.  On the list of people to benefit from the grains, he said, “If you remember very well, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. President also directed and approved the release of grains, the grains were released and distributed.
 
“So, those structures of distribution, both from the Humanitarian and the Ministry of Agriculture, are the same structures that we used. However, whatever you do, you take a look, is there any area for improvement? Is there any area that you can change, or restructure? We’ll consider that and distribute the grains as has been done in the past.”
