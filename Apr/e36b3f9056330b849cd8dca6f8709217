I vividly remember the clanging of pots and pans as they floated while my sister and I (as toddlers) tried to play in the water, and my parents tried to keep us out of it. Ours was yet another house that had been built on reclaimed land in a swampy/wetland area. Every time it rained, my parents would worry about our safety. Because of this, I can imagine the experience of people who live in communities (including Ijora, Lagos, Nigeria) where ‘rainfall is a curse.’
 
Last July, Lagos was ravaged by yet another flood (perhaps the most serious yet), which left many people dissatisfied. But in particular, it was the focus on climate change as the major issue behind these floods in the media coverage that made it even more dissatisfying for me. While climate change may increase the flooding risk of an area, it is not climate change that pours concrete over absorbent soil, over and over again, and causes it to actually flood (because where do you expect all the water to go?)  It is not climate change that strips away areas of natural vegetation, which take so many years to grow and perform important functions. 
 
Nature has built-in systems, which would help mitigate climate change if they are properly managed. When we are not careful, in the name of development, we strip away the defences we already have against climate change. Wetlands, or marshy ground, containing mangroves (including, and especially those in urban areas) are one of such systems and are thought to store large amounts of carbon (which is one of the major drivers of climate change). And it would seem that the value of wetlands is obvious considering how the media gets flooded every World Wetlands Day, with wonderful messages.
