Young Leaders Coalition of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bauchi State chapter, has accused the former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, of anti-party activities and recommended him for sanction. Chairman of the youth group, Musa Khalid, while submitting the petition to Bauchi APC Chairman, Babayo Misau, alleged that Dogara convened a meeting with some members of the party in Abuja, which the party leadership in Bauchi warned members to boycott. Khalid said: “The meeting was planned in bad faith to destroy the image of our great party. It is, of course, an illegal meeting because any party meeting must be organised through the chairmanship of Adamu Adamu, through the state party. “We wish to state clearly that Dogara is not a party chairman and not a party executive member; rather he is just an elected member of the House of Representatives. His action provokes the party members in Bauchi.” Meanwhile, Misau has assured the angry youths that APC would not underestimate their grievances. He applauded them for approaching the party to table their issue. “The party is solidly behind you. We have listened keenly to your grievances and we are going to address them,” he said. Misau urged the party members in the state to be more resolute and committed to reclaiming power from the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023.
  At press time, Dogara’s media aide, Turaki Hassan, is yet to respond to the allegations against his principal.
