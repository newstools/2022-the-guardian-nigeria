Gombe State governorship aspirant on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), AVM Adamu Fura (rtd), has urged other politicians not to engage in politics of do-or-die. Addressing newsmen in his Gombe residence, Adamu said though he had all it takes to govern the state, he never allowed his ambition to blind him. “If truly patriotism and genuine love for our state is all we all are after, then anybody could have it. If not me, whoever wins it has my support. “My military background will, no doubt, make me a good team player and leader since military is all about leadership and service. Even at that, my ambition is next to the peoples’ wish and need,” the retired Air Force chief stated. According to him, military training is partly leadership and management of resources. He, however, urged all to be actively involved in politics, as “whoever shies away from politics runs the risk of being governed by his inferiors,” according to Pluto. He argued: “We, with military background, ought not shy away from politics because even great nations like United States of America, France and Russia are better under leaders with military training.” Fura, who said he was not desperate to govern Gombe, however, directed his supporters never to disparage any politician with same ambition. “Governorship aspiration is between brothers; it is not a do-or-die venture. I am doing my best in my own ways. I have cautioned my supporters not to disparage other aspirants because I don’t wish for divided house before facing the common enemy, the All Progressives Congress (APC). “I often pray for my fellow aspirants, whether they too pray for me is between them and our Creator,” he added.
