As part of its commitment to promoting the entertainment industry through various initiatives, Bigi carbonated soft drink has rewarded winners of ‘Watch & Win’ promo with a new car. The beverage industry brand gave out a car and consolation prizes comprising laptop computers, blenders, printers, Bigi products and several prizes to the winner and other participants after about a 12-week programme. The Bigi CSD flagged off the reward scheme in December 2021 to excite movie and cinema lovers in Silverbird Cinema in Lagos and Abuja by offering them rewards for their viewing experiences. Speaking on the initiative, Rite Foods’ Brand Manager, Boluwatife Adedugbe, stated that through the promo, Bigi created an exciting movie experience for its consumers in a way that has made movie viewing worthwhile, thus demonstrating that it places them at the core of its mission, offering value for money while having a delightful moment. Expressing delight, the winner, Amarachi Chukwuma, commended the brand for connecting with its consumers through a platform that refreshes movie lovers as they watch their favourite films. “I was excited when l was told I won the prize, as most people were skeptical about it, and today, I am very happy that the Bigi brand lived up to its commitment. Also, I have heard that Bigi is doing a lot for consumers and intends to do a lot more consumer-centric activities,” she said. She further stated that the Bigi brand has elevated her status as a car owner, adding that she would forever be grateful to the brand for bringing an unbelievable change, excitement, and refreshment to her and her family. Other consumers, who received consolation prizes also applauded Bigi for the love shown to them, as the gift would help them wonderfully.
