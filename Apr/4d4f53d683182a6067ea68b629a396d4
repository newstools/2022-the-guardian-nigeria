Joint efforts by the Air Components of Operation Hadin Kai and Nigerien Air Force under the Multinational Joint Task Force may have continued to yield expected impressive results as intelligence to ISWAP terrorist, Ibn Usman and five other associates have been neutralised.
  
A source within the military circle revealed that the joint air strikes undertaken on April 14, 2022 at Tumbun Rego and a training Camp about two kilometres Northwest of Tumbun Rego, have led to the elimination of five key ISWAP leaders, including one of the most wanted terrorists, Ibn Usman.  “Using a mix of NAF and Nigerien Air Force aircraft, the aircraft attacked and bombed the location in the early hours of April 14,2022. The reliable outcome of the strike has now revealed that over 70 ISWAP terrorists were either eliminated or severely injured.
  
“Locals have also confirmed that the strikes and mop-up operations by the Nigerian Army under Op Lake Sanity was successful. Clearly, there seem to be no hiding place for ISWAP and Boko Haram terrorists in the Northeast, especially with the capture of most of their enclaves in Sambisa Forest and the current onslaught in the Tumbuns.
  
“The increased coordinated and joint air strikes by NAF and Nigerien Air Force jets adds an impressive aspect to the new type of operation being witnessed in the Northeast, which should be commended.”
