Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has urged Christians in the state and the country at large to reflect on the reason for the season by showing love, forgiveness and compassion to one another. In a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Richard Olatunde, yesterday, in Akure, Akeredolu described the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ as a symbol of sacrifice and renewed hope for the believers. He admonished the people to reinforce their trust and hope for greater Nigeria, especially in the forthcoming primaries of political parties and 2023 general elections. According to the governor’s Easter message to the people of the state, despite the various challenges facing the country, the hope and trust of the people are the seeds needed to surmount the obstacles and birth a greater Nigeria. “The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ represents Christ’s victory over death. It also brings to the fore the lessons of love, sacrifice and renewed hope for mankind. We must imbibe the teachings this season represents. “As a people desirous of positive change, we must strive not to lose hope; rather, we must invest our trust in God and work hard to emplace good governance in all levels of government. “As we celebrate the Resurrection, let us show love to our neighbors and remember the less privileged.”
