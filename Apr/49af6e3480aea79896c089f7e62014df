Gombe State’s Cricket Field Officer, Mercy Ene Odang, has said the sport is gaining popularity among youths in the state, as well as the entire North East zone. Odang, a member of the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) staff, said insecurity is no longer the only story coming out of the zone, adding that cricket has been playing positive roles in the region. Early this year, the zone debuted at the third edition of the PwC/NCF National U-17 championships in Abuja and Odang, whose team facilitated the zone’s participation, assured that the development was just the beginning. “I will say all the states in the zone are developing the game at the grassroots. The states have field officers and the reports from them are good. “Even though the schools are on break, some students are still able to train, although we will have more kids when  schools resume. “For some students and parents, participating in sports is just like a break-away for them, outside the sad news of insecurity and that’s where cricket comes in. “It’s relatively a new sport to some of them and many are very interested in it. Since our arrival from the tournament in Abuja, a lot of students have indicated interest and it’s almost like no one wants to be left behind,” Odang said. The NCF official also appealed to state governments to invest in sports  to get youths engaged and keep them off the street.
