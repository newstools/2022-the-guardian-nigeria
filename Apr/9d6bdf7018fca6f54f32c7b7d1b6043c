Amidst the demand shortfall of Wheat grain due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) has commenced the harvest of 1000 metric tons of grain in Gombe state. The farm which sits on 100hectares of land was one of the 2500 hectares of wheat farmland cultivated in 9 northern states at the beginning of the dry season in December 2021. The NALDA Executive Secretary Paul Ikonne while addressing farmers noted that the harvest was proof that Nigeria can be self-sufficient in wheat production. Ikonne represented by Engineer Olusegun Owolabi, Director of Engineering in NALDA, observed that the feat was worthy of celebration as Nigeria spends huge foreign exchange on wheat importation annually, hence NALDA is changing the narrative. He added, “The authority observed that wheat, an agricultural product, is the third item in the national importation list, and resolved to rewrite history on this. This made NALDA collaborate with some states including Gombe to produce the grain. While appreciating President Muhammadu Buhari’s support in ensuring Nigerians produce what they eat, Ikonne also commended Gombe State Commissioner for Agriculture, Nafada Local Government Chairman, traditional ruler and beneficiaries for giving their best in ensuring a bumper harvest. It would be recalled that the beneficiaries were provided with two brand new tractors, agrochemicals, fertilisers, irrigation pumps, improved hand tools, land clearing and technical guidance by NALDA. The Commissioner of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Gombe State, Magaji Gettado, said the farm would go a long way to improve the livelihoods of farmers in the state. He stated that before the establishment of the farm, youths of the community at this particular period of the year often migrated to neighbouring Taraba State and other towns to earn a living, but noted that they were currently on the ground in Gombe working on the dry season wheat farm.
