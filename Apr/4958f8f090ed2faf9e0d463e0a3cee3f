Horse racing fans in Kaduna and its environs were treated to the best of the sport last weekend when the best jockeys from within and outside West Africa gathered for the maiden FirstBank sponsored Nigerian Derby, an international competition, which climaxed at the Murtala Mohammed Square. With jockeys from Niger Republic winning most of the trophies, Chinada Mamman, riding a local breed horse, was the star of the competition. He won the first prize in the Governor’s Cup after outrunning other competitors from Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Chad Republic for the N1 million star prize. Buhu Mamane and Hadju Husseini won the second and third positions respectively. Chinada, from Niger Republic, again in the special Upper-Class Division A, raced over 12-Furlongs where he outclassed his fellow competitors. However, the highflying Chinada lost out in the Coronation Cup, Taloun A, Upper Class Division to Muka Boyi, who won in the category, while Kamilu Joke came second. Chinada ducked in the third position, while Kanta Mataye also from Niger Republic, completed the top four winners in the category. Kanta Umar won the Presidents Cup in the Thoroughbred B-Open Division and its attached cash prize of N1 million. Satisfied with the outcome of the event, Chairman, Kaduna Turf Club, Mohammed Lawal Ibrahim, commended FirstBank for throwing its weight behind the championship, saying the financial institution’s support contributed immensely to the success of the championship. While urging FirstBank to continue playing its leading role in sports sponsorship, Ibrahim said its effort has greatly helped in building peace, development and growing tourism in the country. The Sixth Nigerian Derby International Horse Racing Championship was held as part of the programmes to celebrate the coronation and first year anniversary of the Emir of Zazzau, Ambassador Nuhu Bamali.
