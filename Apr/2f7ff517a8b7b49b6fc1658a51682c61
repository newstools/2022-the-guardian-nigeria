Poised to tap the nation’s e-commerce spending estimated at $12 billion, a global online giant, QNET has extended its operation to Nigeria. QNET is a global e-commerce and direct selling company that provides customers around the world with unique high-quality products and services. Regional General Manager, sub-Saharan Africa for QNET Limited, Mr. Biram Fall, who spoke at the launch of QNET in Ikeja, said direct selling, used by top global brands and smaller, entrepreneurial companies to market products and services to consumers has continued to grow, with total retail sales amounting to $179.3 billion in 2020 globally. He stressed that QNET’s entry into the country was in line with government’s vision to partner with the private sector to effectively achieve the desired economic recovery and transformative growth. The development, he said, would boost e-commerce and financial technology in Nigeria, already strengthened by fast growing youth population by expanding consumer’s power and smartphone penetration. Fall said the firm intends to play its part by boosting entrepreneurship in Nigeria through a well-established global e-commerce and direct selling ecosystems. Stressing the importance of partnerships as a key pillar of the firm’s business model, Fall said: “Partnerships are part of our DNA, and we are delighted today to unveil our partnership with Transblue Limited.”
