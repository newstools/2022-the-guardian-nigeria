The executive committee of the Lagos Cricket League body, Club Cricket Committee, dedicated the Easter weekend to a grassroots development programme aimed at winning more adherents to the beautiful game, while hosting family and friends to a treat. The one-day ‘Easter Fiesta’ had kids trying their hands on improvised cricket tools under the guidance of coaches at the Tafawa Balewa Square on April 17, 2022. According the CCC Chairman, Akin Denton, “the event is a way to bring families together and also introduce the kids to the game in a funfilled environment. “A number of the cricket players and administrators really don’t have other social life beyond what the game offers. Bringing our families here to have fun will help them get closer to our passion,” he said. The first-of-its-kind event was hosted at the Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket groundside-by-side with CCC league games featuring clubs battling for bragging rights. The event kicked off at around 2.00 p.m., with a mini coaching clinic on the field. It was hosted by Lagos State head coach, Ingram Jones, supported by Azeez Salako, national team batting coach, Leke Oyede and volunteer coach for Lagos State and Ruth Ayannaike. From the field, the children proceded to a quiz competition centred around the game. This session was handled by Yomi Oyenusi and Seun Ajidagba, a cricket journalist. At the end of the session, the children won plenty of prices. At the end of the event, CCC treasure, Olumide Akintokun, said the programme achieved its aim, while promising to raise the bar in the next edition. “I think the kids are happy and we have been able to get the family to get a little more acquainted with all that we do here. This also helped us get to know our colleagues more closely and be able to loosen up because the works we do here can also be so engaging that our relationship becomes transactional. We are also friends and this is a community,” he said.
