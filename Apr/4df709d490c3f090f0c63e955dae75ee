The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and Google Global Services Nigeria have expressed determination to work together to actualise the national targets for ubiquitous broadband access in furtherance of Nigeria’s digital transformation policy.
   
This aligns with and gives unambiguous expression to NCC’s strategic vision plan centring on strategic partnership and collaboration with necessary stakeholders to achieve regulatory objectives.  Earlier in her remarks, the Director, Google West Africa, Juliet Ehimuan, who led the delegation to NCC, commended the NCC for its consultative approach in formulating regulatory policies, as an engine room for optimal delivery of telecommunications services that will in turn impact the digital economy drive of the government.
