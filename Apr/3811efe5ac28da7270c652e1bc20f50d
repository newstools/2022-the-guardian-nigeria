The wedding took place at the Vastu building, where they both own individual apartments. The intimate celebrity wedding which had been in secret came to light when images showing off Kapoor’s Mumbai home decorated surfaced on social media. The Bollywood power couple was gathered by family and friends in attendance. Kapoor’s cousins, who are actresses Kareena and Karisma Kapoor, and filmmaker Karan Johar, were pictured at the wedding. The couple wore dresses by famous designer Sabyasachi, a most sort designer in India. The pre-wedding celebrations started with a customary Hindu ritual called Ganesh Puja at Kapoor’s Pali Hill house on Wednesday. The newlyweds were born into families grounded in the Bollywood film industry. Bhatt is the daughter of a filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and actor Soni Razdan, while Kapoor is the grandson of Hindi cinema legend Raj Kapoor and the son of actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh. Knowledge of their relationship was confirmed by Kapoor and Bhatt in 2018. In an interview, Kapoor said about Bhatt’s acting “When I see her work, when I see her act, even in life, what she gives is something that I’m aspiring to for myself.”
