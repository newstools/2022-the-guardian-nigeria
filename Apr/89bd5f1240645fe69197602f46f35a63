The Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Dame Pauline Tallen, has said she will initiate a conversation with the Minister of Interior Rauf Aregbesola to ensure that psychiatric tests are made compulsory as part of marriage requirements in the country. Tallen also said there is an urgent need to put an end to the culture of reinforcing male dominance in society. The minister stated this on Friday in Abuja while addressing journalists on the alarming surge of gender-based violence (GBV) as witnessed in the last few weeks and the urgent need to curb this menace. She further said everyone must play a part in moulding male children to become better adults who can take on marital responsibilities without feeling insecure adding that our society must move with the realities of the times. “We can no longer tolerate wickedness, greed, envy and malicious acts under the guise of culture,” Tallen said. Tallen said “all leaders in our society to be more sensitive with the way they execute their activities and utilize the powers bestowed on them. The mindset and formation of our young ones require the support of the entire society. From Teachers to doctors, health care providers to fathers and mothers, older siblings and relatives. “We must speak out. This is a call for urgent action to save the lives of women as GBV is becoming a norm. The laws are there in the Child Rights Act and Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, the major problem we have is the implementation”. She urged the judiciary arm of government to speed up trials of GBV cases and ensure perpetrators face the full wrath of the law to serve as a deterrent.
