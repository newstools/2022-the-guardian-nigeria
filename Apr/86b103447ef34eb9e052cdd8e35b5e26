Late Commandant of the Armed Forces Command Staff College, Jaji, AVM EE Osim’s widow, Bisi, is set to host a memorial kitty for her husband at the Calabar Golf Club on April 23. Bisi, also a golfer and a Pastor at Redeemed Church, during the week disclosed that she decided to honour her husband with a golf tourney because he showed an unending love for the game and expended so much money to assist those who wanted to play the game but could not afford it. “My husband just loved the game,” Bisi Osim reiterated. “He was always devoting his free hours to the game, but he hated playing alone. “At all times, he wanted people around him on the golf course. This is reason I am doing this tournament. I know this is what he would have me do.” Also speaking on the kitty, Calabar Golf Club Captain, General AM Sabo, said the club was ready to host a grand event that would befit the status of late AVM Osim, who was a past captain of the club. Sabo, an astute golfer, disclosed that Osim, during his time, expended enough resources to ensure the rapid growth of the Calabar Golf Club, especially in areas of infrastructure and course maintenance. He added that Osim used his abundant charm and charisma to draw people closer and maintain oneness at the golf club. General Sabo added that AVM Osim lived a unique life that impacted hugely on lives of several individuals, irrespective of where they came. He reiterated that this could be reason over 300 golfers from across Nigeria have indicated interest to hit Calabar for the memorial kitty.
