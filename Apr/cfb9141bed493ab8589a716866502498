• Diri cautions against factions in party Former Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has said the move by some presidential aspirants in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to form a united force will enable the party to take over power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. A statement, yesterday, by the Chief Press Secretary to the Bayelsa State Governor, Daniel Alabrah, said the presidential hopeful spoke while briefing journalists after a closed-door meeting with his co-aspirants, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Bala Mohammed, Governor of Bauchi State, with Governor Douye Diri at Creek Haven Government House in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Saraki stated: “We are here to intimate the governor on our efforts to have a consensus candidate.  As you all know, three of us have indicated interest to run on the platform of the PDP. We have been going around talking to the leaders of our party. The governor of Bayelsa is not only a leader but a key stakeholder, who has a role to play in the 2023 election. “We all have individual ambitions but what we have come to accept and believe in is that the interest of Nigeria is far bigger than individual interests. That is why in the last three weeks, we have been moving round the country, letting our leaders know that a consensus approach should be used to pick any of us. “Our appeal to Nigerians is that we feel your pains, the hardship and insecurity. That is why our ambition is to return this country to PDP and make your lives better. We have come to seek your support as we approach 2023. We have spoken very well and feel encouraged by the governor’s words.  Let us start now in building those blocks that will ensure that PDP will make Nigeria a better place.” In his remarks, Diri urged the PDP to forge a united front if the party wants to win the forthcoming election.
