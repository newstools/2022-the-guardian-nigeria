Three words to accurately describe this year’s Oscars award ceremony are; glitz, glamour, and drama. Though several moments happened at the most prestigious event in Hollywood, two moments that would live rent-free in our heads are; Will Smith slapping Chris Rock and the beautiful outfits that graced the red carpets. As if the Oscars red carpet wasn’t enough for celebrities to showcase their fashion trendsetting skills, the after-party hosted by Vanity fair became similar to a runway show. We saw actors, producers, artists, directors, and other personalities strike a pose in front of the cameras, looking stunning, chic, and sophisticated. Here are five fashion trends celebrated at the 2022 Oscars awards ceremony and Vanity Fair after-party. What do you wear to an event that requires chic movements? Simple; a fringe dress. Celebrities like Kelly Rowland and Rebel got the fringe memo loud and clear when they stormed the Vanity Fair party, wearing a black fringe dress and a Moschino floor-length fringe dress, respectively. No stranger to the Oscars, Ruffles continues to prove how versatile and elevated it can become. From Jada Pinkett Smith’s long-sleeved emerald gown with a ruched bodice and a full ruffled skirt to Billie Ellish’s black Gucci gown with many rows of ruffles, we were in for a ruffled night. Nothing screams star power than glitters; a message Serena Williams clearly passed across, wearing a Versace silver mini dress at the Vanity Fair after-party. Following in the footsteps of the tennis legend at the award ceremony are Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya, who shined brightly as two must-watch young actors in Hollywood. This trend has Zendaya and Kristen Stewart’s names written all over it. After the award ceremony, Zendaya thought it befitting to change into a power suit for the after-party, jilting the crop top and long skirt she wore. Kristen Stewart, on the other hand, opted for a simple black blazer, a white shirt, and black shorts.
