Former Super Eagles Coach, Christian Chukwu, believes the appointment of Coach Salisu Yusuf and other Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) managers to oversee the CHAN Eagles, will help address the neglect of home-based players by senior national team coaches. Chukwu, who said the invitation of 30 to 40 overseas-based players for Super Eagles’ games is an anomaly, told The Guardian that the practice has contributed to the poor state of the country’s football. He advised the new coaches to ensure only the best players in the local league made the CHAN Eagles, adding that picking players without sentiments will help the country get a core of the stars needed to build a formidable national team. He added that such development would also spur the foreign-based players to fight for their positions against the current practice of reserving jerseys for certain players. Chukwu advised the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to create an enabling environment for the incoming foreign coach to work harmoniously with the local managers to select the best players in the NPFL for the Super Eagles. “The NFF has appointed those they feel can transform the CHAN team and all we need to do is to support and encourage the coaches. I think the appointment will stop the era where 30 to 40 foreign players are invited to the Super Eagles for one competition. “This has been very embarrassing to a country that has a functional football league.” “We need to see more domestic players in the Super Eagles. The foreign coach, when appointed, should be made to stay in Nigeria to watch our league and also work closely with the local coaches to pick good players for him. “He needs the assistance of the domestic coaches to function well in his duties, even if he brings his own assistants. “I want to see a new Super Eagles where more domestic players are given opportunity to play for the Super Eagles,” he said.
