Off his second album, Greatness 2.0, the TG Omori directed video includes stunning, colourful visuals that keep viewers engaged despite the absence of the featured artists Omah Lay and Joe Boy. In Abeg, the artists sing about their love for a lady that appears to be almost impossible to get. Enjoy the music video for Abeg here:
