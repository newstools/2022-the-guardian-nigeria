The National Union of Textile, Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria (NUTGTWN) has called on the Federal Government to establish a presidential task force to confiscate goods smuggled into the country. 
 
The task force, the union said, should be made up of relevant stakeholders, including members of the union.  The NUTGTWN boss alleged that some Customs officers openly escort smuggled goods across the borders, thereby aiding and abetting smuggling.
 
He alleged that notable smugglers are supporters and financials of most politicians, there was little or nothing they could do to stop them.
 
He called on the NCS to be more patriotic and adopt new creative measures that must include consistent raids of the warehouses of smugglers in Kano, Lagos, Kaduna, Onitsha and other cities in the country. According to him, the promised benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA), will elude Nigeria if illegal imports of textile fabrics and other products Nigeria can produce continue to find their way into the local markets unchecked.
