It signals APC’s comeback, says chairman The political drama, which started on Tuesday at the Adamawa State House of Assembly, climaxed yesterday, as 13 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members sat under police cover to declare vacant the seat of Joseph Kwada (Michika Constituency), who defected from PDP to  All Progressives Congress (APC). The less-than-15 minutes sitting was presided over by the Speaker, Aminu Abbas, who adjourned plenary till August 2023. Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr. Kefas Japhet, claimed that the decision of the 13 PDP lawmakers was based on the constitution. Reacting, the APC said the action signals the beginning of PDP’s sack from Yola Government House.
  Spokesman for Adamawa APC, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the decision was not only unlawful, but desperation to retain power in 2023. “What Adamawa PDP under Governor Ahmadu Fintiri does not understand is that the time for his tenure is coming to an end and there is no magic PDP can do to return to power,” he said. However, there was protest at the Assembly by members of Michika constituency. Leader of the protest, Mr. Koji Garta, told newsmen that they were protesting against plans by few PDP lawmakers to declare the seat of Michika constituency vacant because the occupant defected to APC from the ruling PDP. He argued: “When APC lawmaker, Musa Bororo, defected to PDP, there was no problem; when another member from African Democratic Congress (ADC) defected to APC, there was no problem, why is the situation of our member different? If he has committed any offence, the party should approach the court not PDP lawmakers.”
