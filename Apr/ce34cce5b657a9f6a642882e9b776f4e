This comes after last week’s SmackDown involving Charlotte and Drew Gulak positioning Gulak to a Figure Eight submission that made him tap out. This formed Mark Henry and Bully Ray’s decision to have Flair back on the men’s ring as Henry has been eager to see Flair beat men up. Speaking on a radio show he said “She has the potential to eclipse Ric if she’s allowed to wrestle men and have a run doing that and then going back to women’s wrestling and being the ultimate heel, like, ‘I left y’all because y’all beneath me. That can be, you know, another 10 years of her dominance that can make people only think that when you hear the name ‘Flair’ that you think Charlotte.” Bully Ray also had the same opinion as he said “I love the fact that she put the figure eight on a man last night. I want Charlotte to wrestle men. As the matter of fact moving into this match, you know, put the figure eight on two more guys, three more guys, have guys tapping out left and right.” WWE has revealed a challenge tagged ”I Quit’ Beat The Clock Challenge” which will feature Ronda Rousey and Charlotte Flair for the Friday Smackdown. Flair will battle against Rousey to defend her title at the ”I Quit Match” scheduled for 8th of May at Wrestlemania premium live event.
