 PC Khafi Kareem PHOTO: PA Former Big Brother Naija housemate Khafi Kareem is facing a misconduct probe at the UK’s Met Police over her appearance on the show. According to a BBC see report, police constable Khafilat Kareem faced a panel on Monday at the Empress Building in west London. Khafi had requested unpaid leave from her superiors back in 2019 and an approval to appear on the reality show to “promote the Met Police” globally. However, while the leave was granted, the Met Police denied her request to appear on the show, and she was instructed to not participate in further auditions, interviews or shows. Anne Studd QC, for the Met Police, told the tribunal on Monday: “Having seen the UK episodes of the show, concerns were raised.” “But, PC Kareem said Naija was not like the UK version. She saw it as a chance to promote the Met on an international basis.” “Looking at the website and information provided, Ch Supt Jason Gwillim concluded it was not in the best interests of the Met or the officer and it would put her in a compromising situation.” “He explained the rationale and stressed she was not to take part in the show.” “Gwillim’s impression was that PC Kareem was disappointed but understood. She took the period of unpaid leave.” At the hearing, Khafi admitted to surrendering her laptop to the show’s organisers. She, however, denied allegations of breaching standards in respect of “orders and instructions” and “discreditable conduct” and failing to declare a business interest in relation to publicity and promotion of the show. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist noted that the decision to deny her participation in the show was due to concerns about her mental health, the Met’s public image and her conduct within the house. Khafi was a housemate on Big Brother Naija’s Pepper Dem edition. She spent 77 days on the show before being evicted. After the show, Khafi married fellow housemate Gedoni Ekpata, and they have a son together.
