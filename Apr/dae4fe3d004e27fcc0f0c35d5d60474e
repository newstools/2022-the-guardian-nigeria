The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has warned coaches at the MTN/NPFL/La Liga U-15 tournament held at Remo Stadium, Ikenne, Ogun State to be above board and avoid corrupt practices. The youth tournament, which the first edition was held in 2017, has produced some young footballers for the country. Speaking at a press conference to unveil the 2022 edition, yesterday, NFF First Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi, said he would personally go after any coach, who is reported to be involved in sharp practices to aid his team. The tournament is featuring U-15 sides of teams playing in the NPFL. According to Akinwunmi, the foundation of the nation’s football is in the youth, adding that any coach, who is caught trying to bribe referees for his team to win matches or field ineligible players, will face the full wrath of the law.
