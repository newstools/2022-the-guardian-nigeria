As consultations by presidential aspirants continue across the country, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa has said those seeking to occupy office of the President must be enlightened, visionary, competent, possess positive character, be of integrity and must be courageous. Ohuabunwu, who himself is a contender for the office, spoke when he visited leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State. He arrived on Saturday and immediately paid a courtesy visit to the state chairman of the party, Mr. Tony Aziegbemi. He also visited stakeholders of the party, including delegates, with whom he shared his vision and mission. In his address, the pharmacist said: “Anybody aspiring to be president must be enlightened, visionary, competent, and possess a positive character, be a man of integrity and must be courageous. These should be the criteria for assessing leadership in Nigeria at the presidential level.” He decried injustice and insecurity in the country even as he declared that the country’s economy was in dire straits and vowed to fix the economy if elected President come 2023. He described Nigeria as a potential investment haven and promised to make this manifest by creating programmes and projects that could create jobs to drive away poverty. The aspirant also promised to mechanise agriculture and introduce “reversal tourism” where Nigerian cultural performances would be showcased overseas for financial gains to cut the nation’s dependence on oil revenues.
