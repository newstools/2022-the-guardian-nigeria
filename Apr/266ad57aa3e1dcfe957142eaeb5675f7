Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) President, Amaju Pinnick, has admitted that the only time he dabbled with team selection with the Super Eagles was when he insisted on Ahmed Musa being on the squad for 2018 World Cup in Russia. Pinnick revealed that then Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, had left out Ahmed Musa, but he insisted the player be re-instated. “That was the only time I intervened (in team selection),” Pinnick told Arise TV. He added that he was later vindicated because Musa went on to score twice against Iceland to boost the Super Eagles’ hopes of going past their first-round group that included Argentina and Croatia. Rohr has been reported as saying he was often under pressure by the NFF leadership as regards his team selection.
Pinnick also defended his preference for a foreign coach to head the Super Eagles, saying he won’t be swayed by sentiments and only wants to succeed. He disclosed a foreigner would be the next head coach of the Eagles.
