This is Bieber’s second single of the year after Holy. The music video directed by Cole Bennett shows snowbound Bieber and Toliver as they lose their way. As the music video for Honest begins, Bieber is seen in a bright coral-coloured ski mask, with only his eyes and mouth visible. Throughout the video, viewers follow Bieber and Toliver as they weave their way through snow-covered woods while riding snowmobiles. The duo end up face to face with a third character in the video and are involved in a dramatic shoot-out. “I like that hazel on you / I look straight in your eyes, holy matrimony,” Bieber sings. “Honest / You kept it real with me from jump.” At the end of the video, Bieber and Toliver are gathered around a fire with their female companions, safe and sound. Honest comes just days after Bieber shared a silly music video for a fun rap song titled I Feel Funny,” which featured him goofing off on an actual music video set in an orange ski mask. Cole Bennett, who shot the short music video, explained that I Feel Funny was shot in between filming the video for Honest.
