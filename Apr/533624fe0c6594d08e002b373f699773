The women Yellow Greens, who finished second at the maiden T20 Invitational at the Tafawa Balewa Square in Lagos, is scheduled to regroup after the Easter festivities for the yearly Kwibuka 2022 in Rwanda. Coaches Onome Oghenekevwe, Theophilus Ibidome and Leke Oyede, who oversaw the national team’s participation in the T20 tournament, said they have had a detailed post mortem for the competition and are ready to regroup for the next task. According to Oghenekevwe, “We have never enjoyed support as we did with the participation at the last event. But despite our loss of the title to Rwanda, our team is focused and ready to return to nets. We have reviewed our errors and talked over the technicalities that needed tweaking.” He disclosed that the team’s next major assignment is the Kwibuka 2022 holding in June in Kigali, adding that by the schedule, the players are supposed to resume camp later in April for a six-week camp ahead of the event. “This year’s Kwibuka is a bigger challenge, which will feature more teams, including a European and a South American team, with an opportunity for the Nigerian side to also serve the Rwandan women a revenge on home soil,” he said. He described the Nigerian team as a growing entity, which is not yet in its bloom, adding, “I believe the same way we have seen visible improvements in the team last week, we will also see more when next they turn up at the Kwibuka in June.” The organisers of the yearly women’s event have listed Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Botswana, Brazil, Germany, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania as participants in the competition.
