Uncertainty in the global economy coupled with insecurity in the country and other macroeconomic challenges have continued to take a toll on the capital market as investors’ wealth depreciated by N213 billion in March. Specifically, the market capitalisation of listed equities, which opened the month of March at N25, 524 trillion, depreciated by N213 trillion to close at N25,311 trillion. The all-share index (ASI) equally declined by 395.21 points or 0.8 per cent from 47,360.79 to 46,965.48 points. Market capitalisation value depreciated, despite impressive earnings and dividend announcements from listed companies. The seemingly improved performance and buying interest in financial services stocks, consumer and industrial goods of the NSE failed to push the market indices as sell-offs in large company shares dragged the key performance indices down. Operators said that given the increasing level of insecurity, uncertainties surrounding the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, fuel scarcity, high cost of diesel, electric power collapse, government has to adopt new measures to address the rising insecurity in the country. Vice President of Highcap Securities Limited, David Adonri said the dismal performance of equities in March 2022 is not surprising, owing to uncertainties that surround both the global and domestic economy. “First, it is in tune with the usual trend when the market slows down in March after reacting to full-year corporate disclosures. The equities market was also faced with daunting downside pressures that arose from currency depreciation and uncertainties surrounding the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “The negative impact of US Feds rate hike programme, fuel scarcity, high cost of diesel, electric power collapse and intensified terrorist activities, combined to depress investor’s confidence in equities market. Activities shifted more to the debt market in March.” Data obtained from the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX), showed that investors are set to earn over N780 billion for the year 2021.
