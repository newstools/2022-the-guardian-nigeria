Former national chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has declared his intention to represent Edo North Senatoral district at the Senate on the party’s platform. Oshiomhole’s declaration came after the party council chairman and ward chairmen across the district reportedly beckoned on him to represent the district at the Senate during his 70th birthday in his country home Iyamho, Etsako West Council. He said: “I said until APC is fixed, you cannot talk of contesting election using the platform. I have been chairman of the party, I know the danger we face if we are not able to fix the party and this was completed and consummated on March 25 with the  election of a new National Working Committee and National Executive Council under the able leadership of a former governor, a former minister and a current senator, Adamu Abdulahi. “It is true that for sometimes now, many of our people have asked me, why I did not contest for the Senate seat? I answered that first, APC has crisis, let us fix the crisis and let there be convention. “You can’t begin to discuss what kind of baby you are going to have when you are not married and we have done what we need to do and I am inspired by the position of the new leadership as it relates to retaining power in 2023. Oshiomhole said he was convinced that it was time to proceed to the next stage of conversation on who to lead people of Edo North in the Senate by 2023.
