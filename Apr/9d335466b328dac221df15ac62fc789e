Great Nigeria Insurance Plc has called on Nigerians to take advantage of its new product called MotorFlex Insurance to safeguard their lives and properties. The firm’s Head, Communication Manager, Oyinkansola Sobande, in a release made available to The Guardian yesterday stated many members of the public and road users have not fully realised the importance of third-party motor insurance. She said the policy covers the insured’s legal liabilities for death and bodily injuries to third parties and third-party property damage. She said: “While remedies for bodily injuries and death are unlimited since we cannot put a value on life, the limit for third party property damage is N1 million. “However, many vehicle owners desire to have a cover that provides more benefits than the regular third-party motor insurance but at an affordable premium not as high as comprehensive insurance. “This has allowed the organisation to develop a customised policy that will meet the specific needs of the target public. GNI MotorFlex is an insurance package that takes care of the insured’s car as well as the third party.” The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the company, Cecilia Osipitan said the organisation, in its efforts to deepen insurance penetration, developed unique insurance products at competitive rates aimed at assisting policyholders to mitigate risks.
