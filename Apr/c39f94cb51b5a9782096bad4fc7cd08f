The Federal Government has said it plans to hold a national census in April 2023 after general elections slated for February and March 2023. National Population Commission (NPC) is to conduct a pilot census in June. The last census was held in August 2006. Director General of Nigeria Population Commission (NPC), Nasir Isa-Kwarra, made the disclosure at the end of a Council of State meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Those in attendance included: Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno and Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari. Former Heads of State physically in attendance were Gen. Yakubu Gowon, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar and Goodluck Jonathan. The NPC boss disclosed that the commission would deploy high technology in conduct of the census. He said: “It is very crucial because I have highlighted that the census is a very important exercise for the nation. Through census, we generate the data used for policymaking, planning and development by the three tiers of government and the private sector.” Also speaking, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said the Council approved 159 out of 162 applications for prerogative of mercy to convicts and inmates in correctional centres. The Council, he said, rejected proposal to grant pardon to one of the prisoners sentenced to 120 years for stealing over N25 billion. The reason for seeking pardon was a life-threatening illness.  On his part, Minister of Special Duties, George Akume, said Council approved the conferment of National Honours Award on 434 Nigerians who distinguished themselves in the various fields of endeavour. Earlier, the meeting observed a minute silence in honour of former Head of Interim Government, Ernest Shonekan, who died on January 11, 2022.
