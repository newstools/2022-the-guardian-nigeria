The Federal Government is set to build 150 new shops at the ‘new look’ National Stadium in Surulere, Lagos, as part of the ongoing refurbishing process of the edifice. President Muhammadu Buhari is expected to endorse the proposal, which is part of plans to make the complex a befitting sports arena under the new arrangement. Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, is currently working with the Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) to put the stadium to the expected standard. The ICRC is an agency of the Federal Government responsible for the development and implementation of the Public-Private Partnership framework for the provision of infrastructure services. Among other facilities under the new arrangement, the stadium will have a petrol station, banks and other notable essential services when it eventually opens very soon to the public Recall that over 100 shops were cleared out by the Ministry of Sports over a year ago in an effort to sanitise operations at the complex. Dare said it was indeed tough to get all those illegal occupants and structures out of the stadium, adding: “We were strict with only one mandate to clear out the place because our athletes need the facility to train and keep fit. “There were various drink joints and other things being done at the stadium, which primarily is a sports arena. “Now, we are bringing back the glory. It will take a gradual step but first, we are to bring back new shops and we are working with the ICRC just to ensure we do the right thing. Nigerians will be happy with the progress at the stadium quite soon. “Under two years, we are bringing the stadium back after over 19 years of neglect.”
