The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) have collaborated on insurance product adoption in the private sector. President of the Chamber, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, gave the assurance when members of the Council’s delegation, led by the President, Rotimi Edu, paid a courtesy visit to LCCI in Lagos. Olawale-Cole said the Chamber, one of the foremost and most formidable financial advocacy platforms, would help to propagate knowledge about the value of insurance to business and commerce. He said the two organisations had a lot to do together under his administration as the President. He urged the organisations to join forces in this regard. Edu said that the visit of the Council to LCCI was part of the Council’s strategic engagement with professional bodies to broaden its frontier and working relationship with the organised private sector. Edu urged the Chamber to use its platform to educate its members on the importance of insurance, adding that the industry was yet to command the expected patronage and public acceptance.
