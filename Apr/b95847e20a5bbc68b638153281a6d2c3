The Miami Heat won a crucial game against the Toronto Raptors on Sunday night, and guard, Victor Oladipo was a big reason for the win, reports sports illustrated. Oladipo scored 21 points on 63 per cent shooting from the field coming off the bench. It has been an up and down season since Oladipo came back from his quad injury, but this is a good sign for the Heat as the playoffs are approaching. Oladipo embraces the depth and rotation changes that Miami has. “Knowing that the opportunity could come because that’s where this team works, where different guys are stepping up on different nights,” Oladipo said. Oladipo could be a huge difference-maker down the line. In the playoffs, it is the game within the game that will separate champions from first-round exits. “That’s what I was focused on,” Oladipo said. “When my number was called today, I was ready.” Miami has won four straight games and looking to extend it when they play the Charlotte Hornets Tuesday at FTX Arena which will have playoff implications. Miami holds the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and is two games ahead of the Boston Celtics. • Culled from bellinghamherald.com
