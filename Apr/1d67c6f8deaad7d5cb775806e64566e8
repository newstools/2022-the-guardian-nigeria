The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, Rivers State Command, has arrested 14 suspects for unlawful dealings in petroleum products.
   
Spokesperson for the command, Deputy Superintendent Cadre (DSC), Olufemi Ayodele, in a statement yesterday said the arrests were made following a marching order given by the State Commandant, Abu Tambuwal, who on his assumption of duty warned that the war against illegal bunkering in the state is non-negotiable.
 
Ayodele, in the statement, noted that the Command is determined to ensure zero tolerance of all anti-government activities, especially the act of sabotaging the nation’s economy through vandalism of oil pipelines and illegal dealings in petroleum products.
   
He said: “The first suspect was arrested at Ada George Obio/Akpor Local Council with an 18,000 litres capacity white Man diesel truck marked Rivers MHA 435 XZ, but a part of the content had been discharged before being apprehended by our operatives.
 
“The second suspect was arrested at Abua Junction, Ahoada East Local Council with a truck NGL 141 XA in conveyance of 45,000 litres of suspected illegally refined Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), popularly called diesel; from his confessional statement, the truck was loaded at a dump in Ekporoho community in Ahoada East Local Council of Rivers State. “ Another truck marked KAD MKA 701 ZF, conveying 40,000 litres of suspected illegally refined AGO was also impounded along airport road.
    
Four suspects were further arrested along a truck with number plate Ebonyi ZLL A3 XY in conveyance of products used for construction of illegal refineries.”
 
He said the command would continue to synergise with relevant sister agencies to  fight  criminality  in the  state.
Ayodele said all the suspects would be charged to court at the expiration of the investigation and called on the public to collaborate with the NSCDC in the state by giving credible intelligence to safeguard critical national assets and infrastructure.
