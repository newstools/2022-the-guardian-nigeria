Bandits have killed Nasiru Magaji, a newly elected councillor for Gozaki Ward in Kafur Local Government Area of Katsina State. Magaji was killed in the wee hours of Wednesday at about 12:15 am when the terrorists stormed his community riding on motorcycles. He was elected on April 11 on the platform of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), along with several other executive officials in the 34 council areas of the state. Kafur, which is also Governor Aminu Masari’s local government, is among those most affected by insecurity, especially activities of kidnappers, bandits and ruslters. Thousands of people have been killed, maimed, kidnapped or rendered homeless in recent months due to the security situation. A source in the area told The Guardian that that the bandits shot sporadically and attacked houses without hindrance, and kidnapped two women in the area. The source lamented that such attacks have become frequent in the area and called on the government to address the situation. Spokesman for the police command in the state, SP Gambo Isah was yet to respond to inquiry on the issue as at time of report.
