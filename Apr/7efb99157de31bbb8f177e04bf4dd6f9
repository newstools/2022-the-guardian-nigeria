Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, on Wednesday, applauded the effort of Nigerian Breweries Plc through its Heineken brand for bringing the iconic UEFA Champions League trophy to Nigeria. The minister, who received some of the company’s management team and the Heineken Trophy Tour ambassador, Clarence Seedorf, in his office at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja, said the tour and the brand’s consistent sponsorship of UEFA Champions League, no doubt, pushes the average Nigerian youth to aspire and achieve his set goals. “This is the most glamorous club cup in the world and second most important after the FIFA World Cup and over the years, Nigerian youths have been following the tournament every season. When Heineken decides to bring the trophy to Nigeria, it is a good opportunity for millions of youths to see at close range the cup great footballers in the world have lifted while playing in the tournament. “Nigeria is a football loving nation that has had a strong attachment to the Champions League over the years and the Tour Ambassador, Clarence Seedorf, is one of the most successful players in UEFA Champions League history, as he is the first and currently the only player to have won the UEFA Champions League trophy with three clubs. “Many of our youths that are privileged to have a picture opportunity with him during his short stay will have great memory of the programme,” he remarked. Earlier, while presenting the UEFA Champions League trophy to the minister, Corporate Affairs Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc, Sade Morgan, said the focal point of the visit is to officially present the UEFA Champions League Trophy Tour and its ambassador, one of the greatest and most intelligent midfielders, known as ‘The Professor, ex Dutch national team player and UEFA ambassador, Clarence Seedorf, alongside former Super Eagles captain Austin Okocha and Daniel Amokachi, to your office,” she remarked.
