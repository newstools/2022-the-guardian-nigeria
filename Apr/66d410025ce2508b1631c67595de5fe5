An ICAN fellow, Mr Chukwuma Okolo who is the Principal Partner of Kolton Professional Services (a multidisciplinary management consulting and audit firm) has decided to release works that ordinarily may be classified in the journey of business management, social life, politics and culture. Mr Okolo who is seasoned accountant in practice, director at some 4 star hotels, life coach and a regular public speaker on economic issues will on 21st April, 2022 release 10 works that will shape opinions and order in the coming years. His works will be released to coincide with his 50th birthday anniversary and they are as follows:           The books are not just ordinary read but loaded with everyday application that will bring much value to the general public. The taste of the pudding is in the eating is an old adage and it is applied here when looking at the captions. There is actually no short title that will easily highlight the benefit to be gotten from Mr. Chukwuma Okolo’s works. The preface of one of the books ‘VISION AND MISSION- Broken focus: a foundational reason of failure” tells you actually that the taste of the pudding is in the eating. Below is the preface of VISION AND MISSION:  “From personal projects (and this includes marriage) to national and global projects, the only reason why men and women fail is broken focus. Focus is a member of sight registry. It is the beaming of the eyes or mind on a target. The laser beam is so effective because of the concentration of light on a target. The laser beam is a focused light avoiding all distractions to a target. The laser beam can guide a bullet to a faultless precision at taking out a target. A laser is a device that emits light through the process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The word “laser” is an acronym for “Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation”. A laser emits coherent light and this distinguishes it from other sources of light. The power of the focus of laser has helped at performing and obtaining breath taking feats at cutting, welding, surgeries etc. The strength and power of focus has helped men achieve great things from ancient to modern day history. The historical tower of babel was a project of focus that could not be thwarted and which was only stopped by the dilution and breaking of the focus of the builders. It takes an act of God to terminate things borne out of focus. Late President Kennedy of the United States created the vision of landing a man on the moon by announcing to the congress on 25th May, 1961 that the USA before the end of the 1960’s would land a man on the moon. At the time of the announcement NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) was just 2 years old. The vision compelled, shortened and focused time and space and this was accomplished through the Apollo 11 Mission. The Apollo project was the mission that achieved Kennedy’s vision. The various simple and complex actions carried out with the Apollo Project conceived by the Eisenhower administration brought the vision of Kennedy to pass in July 20, 1969 well within the time frame of the vision. The Apollo Project embodies the mission that navigated the courses and reached the goal of landing a man on the moon which was the vision. Our visions of today could be to marry and have a peaceful home; be a professional; buy cars; build a house; create a prosperous and peaceful country. All the visions mentioned could be achieved by tactically crafted missions. Visions bend time and space and even correct paths to attainment. Visions and Missions are like driving GPS which ultimately endeavor to bring folks to destination vision in less time via the mission of the GPS (Global Positioning System). I heard Mike Murdoch say it and I know that it is correct that ‘the only reason that men fail is broken focus”. A vision and mission ought to be summarized in a statement memorized or written down with lucid words or sentence that is capable of unlocking the energy of reaching the vision. A vision and mission is safe when it has become flesh and sensed in body languages and attitudes. I attempt in this prose to help chart a foundation for my folks based on truths, and my experiences borne out of failures and successes. There is need to codify the concept of Vision and Mission and translate it to a science in order to guarantee results at each time and also make it able to be taught to folks and possibly guaranteeing success at pursuit of happiness and prosperity.” Mr Okolo has targeted the entire demography of Nigeria population to benefit from his works. His books will be great asset when placed at the shelves of schools and public libraries. To enhance portability all the publications will be available online in addition to the print versions. He is also poised to release two more works before the end of the year titled ‘Feminism and Femininity’; and ‘VALUATION: a mystery in capitalism’ Mr. Chukwuma Okolo can be reached at the email: chukwumaokolo2001@yahoo.com
