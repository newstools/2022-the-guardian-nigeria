Efforts are on by the Lagos Island Local Council in collaboration with the state government to relocate traders affected by the Apongbon fire incident.
 
The Council boss, Hon. (Prince) Tijani Adetoyese Olusi, disclosed this while giving an update on efforts to return normalcy to the area and ensure that affected residents have their means of livelihood back.  “As a local council, we are in touch with the Federal and State governments in doing the needful, to fix the current problem and ensure there is no repeat.
 
“As a mark of our commitment to getting the affected traders back on their feet, in weeks from now, in collaboration with the State Government, they would be moved to new and conducive trading points in the downtown commercial hub of Lagos Island, to continue with their trading.
 
“In collaboration with the central government, we are working to ensure that the area affected by the incident is cleaned up and every trading activity and illegality permanently disengaged at the Apongbon/Berger under bridge.”
  
Adetoyese Olusi urged people in the council to be law-abiding to help the government fulfil its mandate.
