The 2022 Oyo State Cricket Season will be flagged off by a ceremonial duel featuring the state’s legends on May 7 and 8 at the Obafemi Awolowo Stadium (formerly Liberty Stadium), Ibadan. According to Abayomi Oke, a former Oyo State Sports Commissioner, who also heads the organising committee of the 2022 League season, said the opening duel is meant to celebrate the contributions of legends in the development of the game in the state. “We have set up this event to honour those that have helped to develop the game and whose contributions helped sustain the game’s development in the state. We believe their efforts, both in the past and now, helped the state attain some heights now,” he added. On the first day of the two-day commemoration games, the legends will present a team to be involved in a four-team round robin encounter. “The opening day will see all the four teams play round robin of limited overs and the two top qualifying teams will play the final on May 8, 2022,” he said. He added that players would be drawn from the Oyo State Cricket Teams (men and women), who would be joined by friends and former playing partners of the honourees selected into their teams. “The May 7 event starts at 10.00 a.m. and games will continue on May 8 by 10.00 a.m., while the two top qualifying teams will compete in the finals, which starts at 2.00 p.m.,” he added.
