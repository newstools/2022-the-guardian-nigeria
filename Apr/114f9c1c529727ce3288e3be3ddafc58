A gubernatorial aspirant under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia State, Mayor Lucky Igbokwe, has promised to turnaround the fortunes of the state if given the mandate. He stated this while receiving the expression of interest form purchased on his behalf by a group under the aegis of Mayor Lucky Igbokwe Support Group. Igbokwe, who promised that Abia State would be revolutionised through transformational leadership to a level that it would become the envy of other states, said: “My decision to run is borne out of desire to add value. This is against the backdrop of the yearnings of the people of Abia, who believe in the youths as an option. I decided to run following calls from stakeholders, including the downtrodden, traditional rulers and eminent sons as well as daughters of Abia. “Without the efforts of the past leadership, however, it has become necessary that I bridge the gap, restore stability and rebuild the confidence of the youths and the good people of the state. To that extent, I have joined in this race with my full chest.   While I appreciate other people, who aspire for this same position, however, I pledge, as a better option, to galvanise the young people and men and women of Abia State to instill a sense of belonging in our administration, which will bring hope and pride to the people.”
