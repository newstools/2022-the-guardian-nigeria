 The Simpsons | Photo Matt Groening The Simpsons makes history as it sets to feature the series’ first deaf voice actor John Autry II, and the first use of American Sign Language (ASL) to be seen on the show.   The show’s upcoming episode, The Sound of Bleeding Gums, follows Lisa Simpson as she chases down the deaf son of her favourite saxophone player, Bleeding Gums Murphy, to help him get a cochlear implant. The episode set to be released on Sunday features sequences of ASL, as Autry voices the character of Monk, making it the first time a deaf actor has voiced a character on the show since its start almost 33-years ago. Sequences of ASL will be shown throughout the episode, and Autry will voice the character of Monk, marking the first time a deaf actor has voiced any character on the show in its almost 33-year history. Speaking to Variety, Autry said, “It’s so incredible.” “It’s life-changing equality and participation. This can impact change for all of us. It’s about hard of hearing and hearing characters coming together. It’s a part of history.” Written by Loni Steele Sosthand, the 17th episode of season 33 of The Simpsons hits home for the writer, as she has a brother who was born deaf and jazz music largely influenced her childhood. “I’m mixed-race; my father’s Black and jazz was big in our house,” Sosthand, who joined The Simpsons in 2020, told Variety. “We grew up in the suburbs, and it was a way for my dad to bring in that aspect of our culture. But when I think about music, I also think about my brother, who was born deaf. When we were talking about this Bleeding Gums character in our initial brainstorms, we thought, wouldn’t it be cool if Lisa discovers this whole other side of his life. That led to him having a son, and then we based that character at least somewhat on my brother. And the story grew from there.” The Sound of Bleeding Gums would premiere on Sunday, April 10.
