Less than five hours to the commencement of the governorship primary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu state fixed for today, Wednesday, three governorship aspirants including former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu have pulled out of the race. Others who announced their withdrawal from the exercise were business mogul, Evarest Nnaji and Josef Onoh. Ekweremadu, in a statement by the Director-General of his campaign organization, Ogbonna Asogwa did not give reason for the decision to withdraw from the race. Sources, however, stated that it might not be unconnected with his believe that the process has been skewed against him. “We will continue to trust God as we appreciate our teeming supporters and the good people of Enugu State for the enormous goodwill they have ceaselessly invested in the actualisation of the “Pathway to a New Enugu State,” “We urge them to remain peaceful and be assured that we will keep them abreast of our decision on the way forward.” In a letter to the state chairman of the PDP, Evarest Nnaji said his decision to withdraw “is in good faith”. The letter titled: “Decision to step down”, signed by the aspirant himself read: “I write to formally notify you of my decision to bring to an end my interest in the Governorship ticket of our party and to withdraw from participating in the primary election scheduled to hold today 25, May 2022.” The governorship primary election of the party holds today at the Nnamdi Azikiwe stadium by 3 pm. No fewer than 19 aspirants are vying for the sole seat in the party in the state.
