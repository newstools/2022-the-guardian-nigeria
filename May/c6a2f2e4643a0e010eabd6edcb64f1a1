A stranded pregnant woman who fell into labour while on transit has been delivered of a baby by a team of the Lagos State Ambulance Service (LASAMBUS) officials.
 
The woman, 27 year old Shukarat Isa, who resides at 30 Akin Akinsheyinwa Street, Awoyaya, Lagos and the baby, a male who weighed 3.3kg, have since been taken to the Ikate Healthcentre for further care and management.
 
Speaking after receiving a report of the successful medical emergency response by the LASAMBUS team, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, explained that the incident occurred around Law School Bus Stop, on the popular Ozumba Mbadiwe Road, Victoria Island.
 
According to him: “LASAMBUS received a distressed call of a pregnant woman in labour at 8.02am and promptly dispatched its closest response team to the venue of the incident. The team arrived at the scene, the Law School Bus stop, at 8:16 am, and quickly set parameters for the emergency response, helping the woman to deliver both the baby and the placenta.”  He added that the present administration has put words to action by commencing the overhauling of the ambulance service with new state-of-the-art ambulances and equipment to further sharpen the operations of LASMABUS and comprehensive and continuous capacity development for staff of LASAMBUS for improved performance.
 
“With over 200 staff, 25 ambulance points and a fleet of ambulances strategically located across the State, the Lagos State Ambulance Service is poised to provide prompt pre-hospital and emergency health care to Lagosians. Ours is a 24-hour medical emergency response service including weekends and public holidays,” Ogboye said.
