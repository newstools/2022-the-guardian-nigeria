The first phase of this year’s Prudent Energy Handball Premier League will throw off on May 22 and end on June 4 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. In a statement by the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), four teams, which gained promotion at the 2021 National Division One League men and women categories held in Benin City, Edo State, will join the other 18 top tier teams in the league. “The preparation for the first phase of the Prudent Energy Handball Premier League has begun and we are merely counting weeks for the commencement of the first phase, which will hold from May 22 to June 4, 2022. “For emphasis and avoidance of doubt, the four promoted teams from the National Division One Handball League 2021, which was held in Benin City in March, will join other premier league teams in the first phase of the Prudent Energy Handball Premier League 2022. “They are Owena Kings and Benue Buffaloes in the men’s category and Rima Queens and Benue Queens. This will make the teams in the Prudent Energy Handball Premier League 2022 to be 22 teams (12 teams for the male category and 10 teams for the female category),” the chairman, Organising and Competition, Emmanuel Akhigbe said. Akhigbe urged the clubs participating in the forthcoming premier league to speed up on players’ transfers, since the HFN’s board has extended the transfer period from the deadline of April 30 to May 11. Recall that Kano Pillars and Safety Babes won the last premier league in the men’s and women’s categories respectively.
