Karlan invoked Barron Trump to demonstrate how the Constitution imposes distinctions between a monarch’s power and that of a president. “The constitution says there can be no titles of nobility,” Karlan told lawmakers, “So while the president can name his son ‘Barron’, he can’t make him a baron.” The pun led to chuckles in the congressional hearing room, but Melania Trump made clear it was no laughing matter.

This action came after the former first lady had her first interview with ‘Fox and Friends Weekend’, since leaving the white house. During her interview, she disclosed that the editor of Vogue magazine is biased when selecting political individuals that would feature on the cover of the magazine. Melania spilled the beans when host Pete Hegseth asked, “Yet with your business background and your beauty, never on the cover of Vogue. Why the double standard? In response, Melania noted that the former first lady before her like Hilary Clinton featured once on the cover and Michelle Obama appeared three times during her tenure. She said that Wintour had “likes and dislikes” and went further to say “It was their decision, and I have more important things to do and I did in the White house than being on the cover of Vogue”. Even though the former model accuses Vogue of bias, she’s not the only former first lady to be shunned by Vogue magazine.
