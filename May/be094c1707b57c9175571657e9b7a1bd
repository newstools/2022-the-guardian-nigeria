Story by Hope Matthew and Directed by Dotun Ololade and Sylvester Ahonsi, Stupid Finder, talks about brotherhood and the discovery of new paths. “Stupid Finder” is a relevant and timely short film exploring how Nigerian not-haves survive and the chances in carving a path out of life. The short film was released on Friday, May 5th on the EbonyLife creative academy platform on YouTube. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1750835 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Stupid-Finder-KV-scaled-e1652646182403.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1810" /> The goal of this short film is to inform and educate those in the lower social class to pursue their goals and step out of the stereotype of their present locations. The short film also explores the depth of love that comes with brotherhood despite differences and diverse views and thinking. Speaking on the purpose of the film, co-director, Dotun Ololade, stated; “What we did with Stupid Finder is simple; we used storytelling to engage the Nigerian communities on complex social issues, in a way that is relatable and make sense of the issues we are addressing. It is an incredible honour to be part of this production and I am so humbled by the opportunity to direct this amazing project and work with the cast and crew.” Produced by Eric Nwanso, Lawrence Iweriebor, Imoh Eboh and Stephanie Ugbeye, “Stupid Finder” takes its cue from the happenings around various rural communities and areas in Lagos, Nigeria. One of the producers of the film, Eric Nwanso, had this to say, “As storytellers from Nigeria who have always tried to show the lives and challenges of the lower social class, “Stupid Finder” puts a unique narrative around the nature of truth in their world. As Leonard Cohen put it, “there are cracks in everything — that’s how the light gets in.”
