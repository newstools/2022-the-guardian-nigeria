A presidential aspirant in Labour Party, Professor Pat Utomi, has stepped down for his rival, Peter Obi, in the race for the party’s nomination as its candidate ahead of the 2023 general elections. Utomi announced that he was stepping down for Obi, former Anambra State governor, on Monday at the venue of the party’s presidential primary in Asaba, Delta State capital. Obi joined Labour Party a few days ago after resigning from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), where he was the running mate to  Atiku Abubakar in the 2019 presidential election. The former Anambra State governor will be Labour Party’s presidential candidate in the 2023 general election.
