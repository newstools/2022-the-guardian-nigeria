It was indeed an exciting day for some wheelchair tennis players on Monday when the Great Summit Club donated equipment worth millions of naira to aid them in their training. The items, including tennis rackets, tennis canvass, tennis wears (top and shorts) and tennis balls were handed over to the players by the members of the Great Summit Club, led by its president, Summit Johnson Olorunsola. Olorunsola said Monday’s gesture was  the second round of donations to the needy, adding that the club had earlier donated wheelchairs to the Nigerian Tennis Federation for wheelchair tennis players and Spinal Cord Injuries Association. Olorunsola said promoting and engaging in philanthropic acts for the needy is one of their primary objectives of the club and thanked the Nigerian Olympic Committee (NOC) and the Paralympic Committee of Nigeria for giving them the needed platform to showcase their gesture. The club added a N10, 000 cash award to each of the four players, including Alex Adewale, Wasiu Yusuf, Foluke Shittu (France-based) and Kafayat Omisore, that won bronze medals for Nigeria at the World Team Cup tournament for making Nigeria proud. NOC Secretary General, Olabanji Oladapo, who was the special guest, commended members of the club for the donation.
