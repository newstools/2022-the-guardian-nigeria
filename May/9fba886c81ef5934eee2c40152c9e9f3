In his post on Instagram, Asghari shared that he and Spears are still working on expanding their family despite the loss of their child. He wrote “We have felt your support. We are taking things positively and moving forward with our future.” “It’s hard but we are not alone. Thank you for respecting our privacy. We will be expanding our family soon <img class="emoji lazyload" role="img" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/2764.svg" alt="❤️" />.” On Saturday, the couple had announced that they had lost their “miracle baby.” The joint statement shared on their Instagram read “It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that we have lost our miracle baby early in the pregnancy.” “This is a devastating time for any parent. Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along. However we were overly excited to share the good news.” “Our love for each other is our strength. We will continue trying to expand our beautiful family. We are grateful for all of your support. We kindly ask for privacy during this difficult moment.” The message was signed “Sam and Britney.” In April, Spears revealed that they were expecting their first child together – the baby would have been Britney’s third. She wrote on Instagram  “I got a pregnancy test… and uhhhhh well… I am having a baby.” Britney Spears and Asghari got engaged in September 2021 after nearly five years together. Earlier this month, Asghari had announced that they had set a wedding date. Back in November 2021, Britney Spears had received her freedom from her 13-year conservatorship on what she described as the “best day ever.” The termination of the conservatorship also gave her the freedom to remove the contraceptive IUD that had prevented her from having a baby.
