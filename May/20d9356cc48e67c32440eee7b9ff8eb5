Following launches in Guam (https://fifa.fans/3yKXXYH), Guyana (https://fifa.fans/3wrmel8) and Puerto Rico (https://fifa.fans/39xOlWP), it has touched down in Africa, with the FIFA Foundation organising a workshop in Djibouti on 9-12 May.  Held in a relaxed atmosphere, the three-day event comprised classroom-based theory modules and practical sessions out on the pitch. An official launch ceremony for the Football for Schools programme was also held on the final day. Among those taking part was Côte d’Ivoire women’s national team coach and FIFA Legend Clementine Toure. “This is a fantastic opportunity for young people in Djibouti,” said Toure. “Many youngsters don’t have the chance to express themselves. Playing football at school allows children to develop their team spirit. It brings them together, lets them share in an experience and develop their self-control.”  Those are the very goals of Football for Schools. Developed in collaboration with UNESCO, the initiative seeks to contribute to the education, development and empowerment of nearly 700 million children worldwide. It also strives to make football more accessible to boys and girls around the globe by making football an integral part of the school system. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of FIFA.
