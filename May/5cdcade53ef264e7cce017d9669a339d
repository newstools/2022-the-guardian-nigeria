• Electoral Umpire Reputation Dented For Succumbing To Pressure From APC – Olurode 
• Powerful Forces Undermining, Pressurising INEC – TMG
• PDP Won’t Be Distracted By Shenanigans, Underhand Dealings Of APC For several weeks, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) held off pressure from political parties to tinker with the schedule of activities that it laid out in the 2023 election timetable. But as it battled to shrug off the pressure, the political elite that is always ready to go the extra mile to feather its nest, no matter how selfish the action may appear kept on pressing harder. Alas! The electoral umpire last Friday caved in and granted a six-day extension period for the conduct of party primaries by political parties. The commission had earlier given political parties June 3 to conclude their primaries.
  
As the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) sustained the pressure on the electoral umpire, some of the 18 registered political parties maintained that they need the extension of time to sort out many things to get right, the process of selecting their candidates for the 2023 presidential election. 
  
At the forefront of the campaign to extend the deadline was the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), which immediately moved its primary to June 6, 7, and 8. The exercise was initially scheduled for May 29 and 30.
Conversely, the leading opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), went ahead with its primary, despite the days of grace meant to help parties to fine-tune their strategies among others. “The commission has decided to allow the request of the political parties since the six-day period does not conflict with the next scheduled activity, which is the submission of the list of nominated candidates, or any of the subsequent timelines, which remain sacrosanct,” Festus Okoye, the INEC National Electoral Commissioner for Information and Voter Education stated while explaining the rationale behind the extension.
  
Okoye added: “Political parties are therefore advised to ensure that their primaries are free of rancour to meet the timelines for the remaining activities embodied in the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general election.”  “Our observers reported that aspirants’ agents were largely involved in coordinating vote-buying for various persons seeking political offices, which is unfortunate,” the group said.
