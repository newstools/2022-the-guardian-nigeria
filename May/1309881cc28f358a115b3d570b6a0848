A mob has killed a Christian female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Wamako, Sokoto State. The deceased, identified only as Ms Deborah, was accused of passing unflattering comments about Prophet Mohammed on campus. Following immediate threats to her safety, she was immediately evacuated to the security post of the school where the mob took her from the personnel. A video of the deceased being beaten and hit with sticks and subsequently burnt to death has since gone viral. Kano State Commissioner of Information, Isa Bajini Galadanchi, said Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal had ordered that the school be shut and directed the Ministry of Higher Education and relevant security agencies to investigate the matter. “The Governor has called on the people of the state to remain calm and maintain peace as the government would take appropriate actions on the findings of the investigation,” Bajini said.
