The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, yesterday, struck out the suit filed by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele. Emefiele had sought interpretation of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022. Justice Ahmed Mohammed took the decision at the resumed sitting after Emefiele’s counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), withdrew the suit. Ozekhome told the court when the matter was called for continuation of hearing that his client had instructed him to withdraw the suit. He did not give further explanation. Emefiele had in an originating summons asked the court to interpret Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, whether it affects his ambition as a CBN Governor desiring to contest the 2023 presidential election. Section 84(12) provides that political appointees shall resign and vacate their offices 30 days before a primary if they are to vote and be voted for during election of candidates. He claimed he is a public servant whose right to participate in the election is covered by Section 318 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), which provides that he vacates office 30 days to the February 2023 presidential election. He had expressed fear that any political party he chooses to affiliate with might disqualify him based on the provisions of Section 84(12). Though Emefiele had joined Independent National Electoral Commission and Attorney General of the Federation as defendants, the court, last week, joined Peoples Democratic party (PDP) and a civil society group, Safe Our Father Land, as co-defendants.
