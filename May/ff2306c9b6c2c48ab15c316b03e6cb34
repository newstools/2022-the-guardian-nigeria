Grange School reaffirmed their supremacy as the undisputed kings of the pool by emerging champions of the Zenith Bank Inter-School Swimming Gala (Primary Category) at Ikoyi Club at the weekend. The win ensures Grange completed a double as its secondary school earlier triumphed in their class a few weeks ago. A heavy rain had forced the suspension of the programme on May 21 and by the time proceedings resumed on Saturday, there was no looking back for the Ikeja-based elite school, as its swimmers garner 10 gold, three silver and four bronze medals. St. Saviour’s and Children’s International Schools settled for second and third places with 7-8-9 and 5-9-4  medals respectively. The likes of Tobi Benson of CIS, Olumayowa Kuti and Teniola Akin-Olugbade  (both Grange) were among the top performers, but worth mentioning is the courageous display of seven-year-old Ogheneruno Jason Atebe of Priory Preparatory School, who won gold in the 33.3m butterfly and silver in 33.3m freestyle.
