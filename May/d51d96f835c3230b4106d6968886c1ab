Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has won the All Progressives Congress governorship ticket to run in the 2023 election. At the end of the primary election spearheaded by the Electoral Committee Chairman, Mr Adamu Shettima Yuguda, Sanwo-Olu scored 1170 votes though he was unopposed as the two other candidates who bought forms were not cleared by the party to participate in the primary election. While 1225 delegates participated, 1198 were accredited and 1182 votes were cast with 12 invalid votes. The election was held at Mobolaji Johnson Stadium, Onikan, Lagos. After Yuguda announced Sanwo-Olu winner of the process, the governor thanked all those who made the process the party’s primary success. He thanked all the party leaders, members and delegates for believing in him and his deputy to be put forward again to contest. Sanwo-Olu said the decision to put him forward is a promise to do bigger things for Lagos residents and he and his team would not fail but double up their efforts. Earlier, Yuguda said that the two governorship aspirants who picked forms to contest in Lagos were not on the ballot paper because they were not cleared by the screening and appeals committee of the party. There had been rumours that the two governorship aspirants vying for the party’s ticket, Wale Oluwo and Olorunfemi Mustapha, were barred from the venue of the primary. But Yuguda maintained that because they were not cleared, they had no reason to be on the ballot and to be present at the venue of the primary. Voting started around 1:54 pm and ended around 3:25 pm.  Although the expected delegate at the election was,1225, only 1198 were accredited and voted. Five delegates were expected from each of the wards across Lagos State.
