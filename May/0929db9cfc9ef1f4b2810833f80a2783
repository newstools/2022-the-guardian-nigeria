Former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Pastor Usani Usani, has confirmed dumping the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). He also confirmed that he would be contesting for the Cross River governorship race under the PRP. Usani, who maintained that members of the APC were not his enemies, disclosed this in a telephone interview with newsmen in Calabar, stating that his decision to move to another party was occasion by the “democratic shrinking space”. He said: “Members of the APC are not my enemies. We built up the APC but it is the constriction of the democratic space that has occasion this expediency.” Usani was one of the founding fathers of APC in Cross River State and later became the first substantive chairman of the party in 2013. The former minister had in 2003 and 2011contested for the governorship position; and in 2019 attempted again.
