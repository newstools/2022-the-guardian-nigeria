Cryptocurrencies entered the financial market in 2009, with the launch of Bitcoin. With thousands of different cryptos worldwide, we have watched the market grow and become one of the biggest sectors within the economy. Litecoin (LTC) launched in 2011 and is currently ranking 20th on coinmarketcap, at the time of writing. Compared to a new coin currently in the presale stage, Parody Coin (PARO) is a great example of how crypto has evolved. Launched in 2011, just 2 years after the release of Bitcoin, Litecoin is almost identical to Bitcoin. This is likely due to the roaring success of Bitcoin. Despite its aim to mimic Bitcoin, Litecoin has done exceptionally well over the years as it is one of the most popular coins on the market. Being decentralised and blockchain secure, Litecoin is a trusted way for users to invest and use crypto. Arguably, LTC is a basic coin and is easy to use, which is good for beginners and users that prefer trading with simpler cryptos. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1753358 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-coin-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Since the launch of Litecoin, the crypto market has evolved significantly.

Hence, for a new crypto project to enter the market, it has to ensure it has key features to make it stand out and attract users. Parody Coin does a great job of this, especially as it is still in the presale stage. With a clear plan set in place for its users, it seems that Parody Coin can become big in the market, possibly more so than LiteCoin.
