The outgoing President of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Prof. Innocent Ujah, has disclosed that the new increased hazard allowance for its members would become operational by end of this month. Speaking, yesterday, at the NMA’s 62nd Annual General Conference and Delegates Meeting (AGC/DM) held in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Ujah said the association was able to successfully negotiate for the rise during the 2020-2022 tenure, adding that there was also a renewed and rekindled interest, involvement, and participation of medical elders as well as professional members in positions of authority within the period. It would be recalled that the Federal Government, in June last year, offered to increase health workers’ hazard allowance in all government establishments. He expressed satisfaction with the association’s position, saying it had gained more visibility than before. Ujah, who is also the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Medical Science, Otukpo, Benue State, said though his administration started during the COVID-19 pandemic, the association’s leadership was able to sail through. He recounted that after the inauguration of the National Officers’ Committee (NOC) in May 2020, there was high-level advocacy, constructive engagements, and increased visibility of NMA, both nationally and internationally. He further said: “The very high level of accountability and transparency exhibited and instilled in his tenure, further enhanced its visibility, relevance, and integrity. He said: “The association’s renewed relevance was further highlighted when Governor Nyesom Wike invited NMA leadership to lay the foundation stone of the College of Medical Sciences, Rivers State University, Port-Harcourt, Rivers State on Saturday, June 5, 2021. It was, indeed, a historic moment and of no mean feat, as it was a demonstration of the confidence and regard for integrity, His Excellency has for my person and our dear Association.
