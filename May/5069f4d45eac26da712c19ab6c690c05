The three-day training series included in YouTube’s Future Insiders programme will help up-and-coming producers and songwriters build their skills and abilities through hands-on training from famous music and industry leaders. Sarz, real name Osabuohien Osaretin, founder of the Sarz Academy, explained the motive behind the academy. “We founded the Sarz Academy in 2015 to help creatives thrive in the creative and business of entertainment.” “Our objective has always been to help turn the enormous potential that exists in the music creative space into genuine accomplishments. We recognise  that, although many young Nigerians possess the necessary abilities for the industry, many are unable to create a successful music career owing to a lack of grasp of the business and production foundations,” he added. YouTube had earlier announced that a series of activities commemorating Africa Month will take place throughout the month of May. The initiatives, including the Future Insiders’ workshop, are meant to bring attention to and show appreciation for the artists and creatives who are moving Africa’s music business forward. “We are delighted to be working with the Sarz Academy to present the Future Insiders programme,” Addy Awofisayo, YouTube’s Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa said.

“At YouTube, we’ve always been committed to supporting the next generation of music creatives out of Africa, and we are thrilled at the opportunity to connect the impactful work of the YouTubeBlackVoices Fund with The Sarz Academy’s efforts to support the artistic aspirations of Nigerian music creatives.” Future Insiders is a component of the Black Voices Fund’s Music Community Pillar, which provides possibilities for exposure and learning for young people all across the world. Future Insiders has collaborated with community-oriented groups in New York, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, Rio de Janeiro, Houston, Atlanta, London, Lagos, Accra, and now Memphis. In addition to technical production and business sessions, selected participants will access one-on-one sessions with YouTube to learn how to connect and use the platform to drive the best engagement, as well as learn about all the essential tips such as creating and developing their brands, self-marketing, building positive artist and producer relationships, and revenue streams to consider. The #YouTubeBlack Voices Fund is a multi-year $100 million fund dedicated to amplifying and developing the voices of Black creators and artists and their stories.
