• Fasua: Injection of CBN chief, Adesina points to more complex game plan
• He has no moral, ethical reason to remain in office, say lawyers  
• HEDA petitions ICPC to investigate Emefiele After months of speculation, the picking of expression of interest and nomination form by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele, to join the race to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari has drawn the ire of many, throwing up frenzied reactions from politicians, financial experts and lawyers over the impropriety or otherwise of the apex bank’s chief joining the fray. It was gathered at the weekend that owing to implications the situation could have on the nation’s economic outlook, the House of Representatives immediately convened an emergency plenary session for Monday (today) to deliberate on Emefiele’s presidential ambition, which crisis in the aviation sector may have put at bay.  
Though Emefiele, on Saturday, said he had not taken a decision on the 2023 presidency yet, there have been heated reactions to the purchase of presidential nomination forms of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by a coalition comprising Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Emefiele Support Group and Friends of Godwin. The CBN governor has been under intense pressure to resign since then, with many raising concerns about a potential conflict of interest in his possible involvement in politics may have raised. Responding to the support groups’ decision to pick up a nomination form on his behalf, Emefiele, who had earlier distanced himself from the ‘distraction’, turned down the gesture, saying, “I will use my own hard-earned savings to buy my own nomination forms and would not do so through proxies.” He, however, did not foreclose the possibility of heeding the call to join the race but asked for time to seek the divine guide. 
   
Emefiele’s response has raised controversy on the morality and legality of a sitting CBN governor’s participation in the partisan process, the extent to which this has breached the CBN Act and if a case of conflict of interest can be established.  REACTING to the development, Ibadan-based lawyer, Yomi Aliyu (SAN), said while Sections 6 to 11 of the CBN Act provide for the qualifications of the CBN Governor, Section 9 bars him from taking up any other job than being the governor.
  
By this, the lawyer stated, Emefiele is a public office holder, unlike Ministers who are political officeholders. He explained that the office of the CBN governor has a guaranteed tenure.
  
“If the law says that he cannot take up any other job, I doubt whether he can pick the nomination form for political appointments without resigning his post. 
  
“It is illegal, morally wrong and unethical. He ought to have resigned before embarking on hunting for an elective post, being somebody in charge of the commonwealth of the people. It is an abuse of office in the extreme for him to say the debtors of his bank got the N100 million nomination forms for him. If they have that much, why did they have to approach him for a loan?  A civic group, the Human & Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) has petitioned the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), urging the body to investigate the CBN governor and an emergency interest group, Green Alliance. HEDA, in a statement, said it had petitioned the ICPC to take swift action to prevent the breach of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act by the Governor, by promptly and diligently investigating the motive and sponsors of The Green Alliance Movement and if any foul play was uncovered, such culprits should be prosecuted accordingly. The group said the statement by the CBN governor shows that he had been involved in politics contrary to Section 9 of the CBN Act.
 
HEDA said, “As the CBN governor, Emefiele keeps Nigerians confused regarding his 2023 Presidential bid, the ICPC has responded to a petition filed against him by HEDA Resource Centre last month. “As the event unfolded, HEDA petitioned the ICPC to take swift action to prevent the breach of the Central Bank of Nigeria Act by the Governor, by promptly and diligently investigating the motive and sponsors of The Green Alliance Movement and if any foul play was uncovered, such culprits should be prosecuted accordingly. “In a response signed by the Petition Registrar, H.S Folaranmi, on behalf of the chairman of the Commission, Bolaji Owasanoye, to HEDA, ICPC acknowledged HEDA’s Petition and averred to act accordingly. “The chairman of HEDA, Mr. Olanrewaju Suraju, confirmed that its petition among others must have prompted Emefiele to come up with his latest statement on his Twitter handle, ‘This is a serious decision that requires God’s Divine intervention, in the next few days The Almighty will so direct.’” HEDA’s boss maintained that Emefiele had been involved in politics and a member of APC contrary to the law. “By telling Nigerians that within the week, he would let Nigerians know his stance (to run or not) after hearing from God, it then means he’s been involved in politics and member of APC, contrary to the law,” Suraju asserted. “He reminded Emefiele that failure to publicly state his position on the 2023 general election would not only be precarious to Nigeria’s currently fragile economy but inimical to the country’s financial integrity, saying that the current state of the economy requires all actors to stay focused on the task of repositioning Nigeria on a trajectory of prosperity. “Going by our mandate as a leading anti-corruption organisation in Nigeria, we expect every political aspirant to play by the rules, but they must remember that good governance remains the hallmark of democracy,” he added.
