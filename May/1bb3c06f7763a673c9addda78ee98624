Streets and roads in Enugu metropolis were, yesterday, completely deserted as economic and social activities were grounded to mark the Biafra heroes and heroines’ day in the South East. The report is the same in Imo, Anambra and Ebonyi states. The celebration is marked by pro-groups on May 30 every year, to pray for those who died during the 1960s Biafra-Nigeria civil war. This year, it coincided with the Monday sit-at-home, which the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) declared in the fourth quarter of 2021, to put pressure on the Nigerian government to release their detained leader, Nnamdi Kanu. Our correspondent, who monitored the situation in Enugu, especially around T-Junction Flyover, Timber shed Market, National Open University, Trans Ekulu, Enugu, Roman Store Road, Nowas-Trans Ekulu Road, Abakpa Flyover, and T-Junction Road, among others, reported that those roads were completely deserted.  IN Anambra State, the Monday sit-at-home order, once again, paralysed activities in some parts of the state as banks, schools, markets, motor parks, and fuel stations were shut. Several roads across major cities such as Onitsha, Nnewi, Oba, Obosi, Ekwulobia and some parts of Awka were empty, as vehicles deserted the roads. THE story is not different in Imo State as motorists, markets, business centres, schools, filling stations, and banks were closed in various parts of the state. While the roads, motor parks, and relaxation centres were empty, some desperate Okada riders were seen in some areas taking frustrated passengers to their various destinations at exorbitant fares. Our correspondent, who monitored the situation reports that some drivers of the Imo City transport buses also operated through the bush part to avoid the wrath of the supporters of IPOB. It was also reported that the presence of security operatives was heavy, as they patrolled the major roads to maintain peace and order.
