The United Kingdom (UK) and Nigeria have held trade and investment talks at the Economic and Development Forum (EDF) in London to promote trade and boost a partnership worth over £3b.
   
At the forum, both countries marked increased support for small and medium sized enterprises in Nigeria including the UK Manufacturing Africa programme, which has helped 12 firms in Nigeria secure foreign investment. When these deals conclude, they will generate over $300 million in foreign direct investment (FDI) for Nigeria and directly create 5,000 jobs.
While disclosing these, the UK Minister for Trade, Penny Mordaunt said: “Nigeria is one of our long-standing and strategic partners in Africa, and I am pleased that the UK is continuing to deepen our investment relationship with one of the most vibrant and innovative economies in the continent.
