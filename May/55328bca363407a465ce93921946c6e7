One of Nigeria’s most successful basketball coaches, Adewunmi Aderemi, has showered praises on the Federal Government for stamping out the maladministration bedevilling the progress of basketball development in Nigeria. The Nigerian government, in an announcement made by the country’s sports minister, Sunday Dare, recently announced that Nigeria would take a two-year break from international basketball following the five-year leadership impasse that has truncated the development of the sport in the country. The decision was announced on Thursday and opinions have been divided about the effects. But Aderemi, a major stakeholder in the sport who was in the technical crew of the national women team that qualified for the World Cup in February in Serbia, said it was good to take a break and sort the five-year problem rocking basketball in Nigeria. Aderemi said: “Some right thinking Nigerians will applaud this move while the myopic, self-centred group of people, feeding fat from the crisis will try to use their friends in the media to blackmail you. “They did same when the governments of presidents Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan did same on football years back that made both leaders rescind their decisions. “For me, the FG has taken a courageous step and posterity will be there for the current minister, Sunday Dare. Enough of this ridicule year in, year out before the international community. Besides, this action by Mr President will serve as a warning signal to other problematic sports federations. “This is the time to examine where we are with basketball, what to do in the holidaying two years from international competitions after putting our house in order. The minister and FG are on the right track. Charity they say begins at home. Our players back home need to get busy while some are rotting away, yet to be tapped from the grassroots.”
