Digital platform, Accelerate, has collaborated with Access Bank to launch Accelerate Plus, a premier subscription video-on-demand platform. According to the organisations, the platform would feature a host of carefully curated high-quality African content made available on mobile devices. Speaking at the launching in Lagos, the Chief Executive Officer, Accelerate, Colette Otusheso, said the product was more than a platform for African content and would serve as a catalyst for highlighting and promoting an undiluted African narrative in the face of global misconceptions. “For this purpose, we have taken deliberate steps to curate authentic and exciting content for Africa by Africans, as well as to create a portal for the rest of the world to access premium African content from anywhere in the world,” she said. She reaffirmed the firm’s commitment to the development and support of the African creative industry, noting that Accelerate was collaborating with African filmmakers and content creators. Accelerate Plus is a diverse and affordable streaming platform that provides exclusive African content. To gain access to the platform, customers are required to pay subscription fees, while they can connect to the platform from PCs, mobile phones and tablets.
