 Letitia Wright | The Times With ongoing talks about the sequel, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”, it is uncertain how T’Challa, played by the late Chadwick Boseman will be portrayed in the expected film. However, numerous members of the team have spoken about how the sequel will respect Boseman’s legacy. T’Challa will not be recast, nor will the character be digitally re-created. Letitia Wright, in an interview, revealed that members of the team had to deal with a lot of events and tough issues, but looks forward to seeing how the sequel honours Boseman’s legacy. Teasing on, Wright noted that “It is an incredible honour for Chadwick Boseman, it’s jam-packed with exciting stuff. We honoured him by committing ourselves to the story that he started, the legacy that he started with this franchise.” Wright added, “And we just committed every day to working hard, no matter what circumstances we faced and we faced a lot of circumstances, a lot of difficult situations but we came together as a team, and we poured everything into this movie, so I’m excited for you to see it.” The path to the release of the “Black Panther” sequel hasn’t been easy for Wright, who suffered an on-set injury and was the subject of a damning story stating that her unwillingness to get vaccinated was causing Marvel problems. Wright shot down accusations calling the report incorrect.
