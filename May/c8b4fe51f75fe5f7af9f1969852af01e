Applying honey regularly to your skin can give you results beyond your imagination and can go a long way in giving you healthy, younger-looking and glowing skin. Below are some of the benefits of honey for the skin. Deeply moisturises the skin: The reason why honey is often found as a base ingredient for almost every beauty product is because it deeply moisturises and softens the skin from deep within. The sugar present in honey acts as a natural humectant, that is, it draws moisture from the air into your skin. It reduces the dryness of the skin by providing long-lasting hydration. Acts as a Pore Cleanser: Honey contains antioxidants, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties which help to rid your skin of blackheads and acne by removing dirt from pores. It then hydrates and tightens skin pores for a clear complexion. Acts as a Gentle Exfoliator : Artificial exfoliators often cause your skin to go red and may cause irritation. Honey is a good alternative because it is a natural exfoliator. It helps exfoliate your face and skin by gently removing the dead skin cells. This, in turn, also leaves your face with a brighter complexion. The enzymes work as a gentle exfoliator, taking off dead skin cells and leaving you with a radiant complexion. Lightens Scars: Honey nourishes damaged skin and improves the scar healing process. The antioxidants present in honey help repair damaged skin by minimising inflammation, which helps the skin heal faster. It also increases tissue regeneration and helps to revive the skin cells. For blemishes like eczema, use unpasteurised honey for faster healing. Useful in Sunburn: Honey is known to be one of the best home remedies for treating burns. Honey promotes healing by decreasing inflammation and providing nutrition to the damaged tissues. This is what makes honey an amazing remedy for sunburns. Fights Acne & Pimples: Honey has natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties that aid to heal breakouts. Its anti-inflammatory benefits help remove excess oil from the surface of the skin by clearing out blockages or clogged pores. It can be used to provide relief from autoimmune skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis. The healing properties in honey help skin repair damage faster. Helps to reduce fine lines and wrinkles: Honey moisturises the top layers of your skin and reduces wrinkles and fine lines. Using honey on your face in the form of a homemade mask will increase your skin’s elasticity due to its antioxidants, which stimulate collagen production, thus making it look youthful and glowing. Brightens Skin Complexion: You can use honey as a home remedy to brighten your skin because honey contains alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) which have a natural exfoliating effect on the skin. This sloughs off dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, thus revealing a brighter complexion. Adds a natural glow to your skin: Honey adds a touch of natural glow to the skin. It can be applied directly to the skin or mixed with milk or yoghurt to make a mask for the skin. Used as a lip balm: Honey can be used to soften some chapped and dry lips. Honey’s ability to hydrate and the presence of minerals, enzymes, and antioxidants, make it the perfect lip balm. Simply apply some raw honey to your lips, leave for a few minutes, and then wash it off. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1753607 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-897x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-1728x1152.jpg 1728w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920-600x400.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/honey-1006972_1920.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Here are some types of honey masks you can try for your skin Honey, lemon, and baking soda acne-fighting face mask Mix one teaspoon of lemon juice, one teaspoon of honey, and one teaspoon of baking soda in a small bowl. Apply the mixture gently over the face and avoid the area around the eyes. Leave the mask for fifteen minutes and remove it with warm water. Honey, green tea, and almond oil face mask for sensitive skin Mix one teaspoon of green tea, one teaspoon of honey and one teaspoon of almond oil in a bowl. Apply the mixture to the face and leave it for fifteen minutes and then wash it off with warm water. Honey and Oatmeal face mask for exfoliation Mix two teaspoons of honey and one tablespoon of ground uncooked oatmeal. Apply the mixture to the face and the mask sit for fifteen minutes. Use a warm washcloth to wipe off. Oatmeal contains a compound called saponin that helps with soaking excess oil from the skin as well as anti-inflammatory properties which remove dead skin cells.
