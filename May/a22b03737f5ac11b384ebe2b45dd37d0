Although the play is set in the imaginary town of Hawkins, Indiana, the pop-up store Hawkins is located in Oakbrook Mall in the western Chicago neighbourhood of Oak Brook. It’s a Netflix official, one of a kind shopping experience for super fans, complete with exclusive products accessible only in shops and not online. Fans can register for timed, free tickets to enter the space, which includes a stop in Joyce’s living room, working bicycles, a full and free Palace Arcade, Starcourt Mall, Hawkins National Laboratory, the Snow Ball, and a photo op with a doppelganger. The adventure takes you on a journey through the show’s main themes and situations and delivers some Easter eggs to those who look closely at the apparel and toys on display. Netflix, intends the Stranger Things Store to transport guests to the heart of Hawkins in a fully immersive retail experience that screams 80s nostalgia. Visitors step in and turn the corner into Joyce’s Living Room, complete with an 80s couch, a Dungeons and Dragons game open on the wooden coffee table, and a few boxes of Russian Cheerios adorning the walls, as well as an old-school black and white television, new Stranger Stuff soundtrack vinyl LPs; for sale, and an assortment of things that would instantly transport visitors to a nostalgic state of mind. The Palace Arcade another stop after roaming around the living room. There, is a blacklight party room brimming with merchandise like a real arcade games Gala GALA, Ms. Pac Man, Dig Dug, and Centipede are all available to play. The games are completely free. After the arcade room is the Hawkins National Laboratory, that holds a wall of demogorgon t-shirts and toys, including a gorgon plushie. There are also some more expensive items, such as collector statues of major movie sequences. The demogorgon emerges from a wall after going through the lab. In Hawkins High’s corridors, are a few lockers, with a few boxes of Eggos laying around, and the opportunity to purchase a Hawkins gym uniform before traveling to the Snow Ball, a scene that was the highlight and finish of Season two of the series. The Snow Ball trail, leads to Starcourt Mall, Scoops Ahoy, and a variety of neon products that are exactly in trend with 80s attire. There’s also a photo section with bicycles and a doomed backdrop where you can try on the “Stranger Things” costume ideas or even imagine yourself as a character from the show. Featuring in the store are some Easter eggs: Hellfire Club attire was prominent, and because the organisation members appear significantly in the season’s first episode. In addition, a collaboration between Netflix and iam8bit resulted in an artist Chogrin creating “Elegorgon,” a vinyl sculptural work on exhibit. It is not the first store dedicated to Stranger Things. In 2021, the concept debuted in New York City and Los Angeles, where lines ran around the block as people waited to get inside. Stranger Things will premiere on Netflix on May 27, just in time for Emmy nominations. The first half of the season will be available on May 27, followed by the second half on July 1.
