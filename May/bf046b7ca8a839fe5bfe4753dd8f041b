Former undisputed world super welterweight boxing champion, Floyd Mayweather, is coming to Nigeria on Friday as part of his efforts at promoting the sport in Africa, the organisers of the trip have announced. Mayweather, who will make his first ever visit to Africa when he arrives in Abuja on Friday ahead of his ring return at the Skies of Dubai on May 14, according to his close ally, Ken Anis, is excited at the prospect of meeting some of his fans in the continent during the trip. Excited by the development, Anis, a Nigerian, disclosed that the boxing legend could also breeze into Lagos before hitting Dubai for the fight. As part of Mayweather’s itinerary while in Nigeria, Anis said the champion will address the press in Abuja and also pay a courtesy call on Sports Minister, Sunday Dare. “This is all about promoting the game and inspiring the youths and all that,” Anis stated.  He stressed that Mayweather has all along been looking forward to visiting Africa, adding that it is great for that to be actualized now. “I hope he gets a rousing reception in the country,” Anis said.	He disclosed that only 30 seats are available at the helipad where Mayweather’s fight against Dangerous Don Moore will hold, adding, however, that tickets are available for viewers via www.globaltitans.com and on live_now.com. Mayweather’s return to the ring in Dubai is another exhibition bout against former professional boxer, Don Moore, who was once the boxing legend’s sparring partner.
Moore, who had a 17-year career between 1999-2016, was unbeaten as a pro, as he won 18 fights, with 12 coming within the distance. He also has one draw in his career.
