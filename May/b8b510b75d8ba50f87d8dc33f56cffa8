AMID poor generation, the 11 Distribution Companies (DisCos) operating across the country, yesterday, denied rejecting 2,495.3 megawatts electricity within a week.
Executive Director, Research and Advocacy for the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors (ANED), Sunday Oduntan, insisted yesterday, in Abuja, that energy supply to DisCos has been constrained. He said: “There were significant periods of low or reduced energy supply nationwide, leading up to the month of April, as a result of the various factors stated by Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu, in his press briefing of March 16. As such, the energy supplied to the distribution end of the value chain has been constrained.” Oduntan said review of the system operator’s report of Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), relative to the DisCos’ rejection of 2,495.3 MW on April 2 through April 8, showed inconsistency. He said DisCos did not receive full value of their nomination for the period due to constraints, adding that for the same period, only 668 MW of energy was unutilised by the DisCos. He noted: “A further review of the report, for the same period, would indicate that 8,038.70 MW was unutilised or constrained due to gas supply limitations (7,443 MW) and water management issues (595.70 MW). DisCos remain committed to continually improving on electricity supply services, based on the energy made available to them on the grid daily. Additionally, we continue to believe that the challenges of the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) can best be resolved with collaboration and alignment of all the interests of the stakeholders, as against finger pointing or sensationalist reporting.”
