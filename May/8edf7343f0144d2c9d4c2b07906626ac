The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has relaunched the Vehicle Identity No (VIN) automotive valuation system, assuring that the system has been reviewed for the benefit of stakeholders.  Acting President, Association of Nigerian Licensed Clearing Agents (ANLCA), Kayode Farinto urged agents to ensure transparency and comply strictly with the trade procedures. He said the rise in the value of PAAR is not professional, as it gives the stakeholders the mind of circumventing the process.
