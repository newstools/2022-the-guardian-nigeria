Meme tokens are crypto tokens made as a joke to make fun of a particular internet concept. The first meme token was Dogecoin (DOGE) and it was made by Billy Markus to poke fun at Bitcoin and the many cryptocurrency tokens that were being made at that time. Dogelon Mars (ELON) is an ERC-20 token that pokes fun at Dogecoin (DOGE), Elon Musk and Mars. It’s easy to read the similarity between all three. The token just like any other crypto token can be bought, sold and held on a crypto wallet. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) is another meme token built on the Binance smart chain, the token refers to itself as a community token with the aim of bringing crypto to an average person and helping dogs in need. Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE) has donated to many animal charities and has also seen some serious returns on investment. RoboApe (RBA) is a revolutionary new meme token that tackles economic restraints by enabling growth through sustainable community growth and rewarding culture.  <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1761033 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="508" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1.jpg 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-1-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /> RoboApe will be a completely decentralised community-driven project with no leadership assigned token at launch. RBA is a deflationary token meaning the supply would reduce over time and the value would go up. In an interview in 2019, Vitalik Buterin the Co-Founder of Ethereum (ETH) said that the power of community has been underestimated and that people just create products without investing in a community. RoboApe is a DAO (decentralised autonomous organization) run by the RoboApe community that will bring development ideas, resources, and decision-making directly to the RoboApe community. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1761034 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="508" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2.jpg 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-MeMe-2-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /> This DAO’s major purpose is to improve and develop traditional DAO ideas to create initiatives that keep profiteers at bay. The solution is to allow developers to collaborate with the community for cooperative progress rather than selfish commercial gain. The overall goal is to create something of great utility for the community and not to make a profit from them. RoboApe’s ecosystem, unlike conventional blockchain, is not confined to a single industry and will serve as a one-stop shop for all things crypto. The site would also include the RoboApe NFT Marketplace, which would allow users to purchase, sell, or trade NFTs. The RoboApe NFT Marketplace would charge an RBA gas price for minting new NFT pieces through a new smart contract. RoboApe’s community will be able to mint photos and GIF memes in the form of RoboApe trading cards that they may hold or trade, thanks to a platform built around meme culture. Once produced, the NFT will appear in the creator’s wallet with no conditions attached. Also, the RoboApe platform would offer unique NFT Minting Events for its community, allowing users to mint new NFTs using the Event’s premier trading card template. Meme tokens are beyond being just for “store of value” purposes like Dogecoin (DOGE), Dogelon Mars (ELON) and Baby Doge Coin (BABYDOGE). RoboApe offers massive utility that ranges from NFT, DAO and lots more use cases that can eventually drive its value to a new high. Join Presale: presale.roboape.io/register Website: roboape.io
