Tomato sauces are commonly used for meat and vegetables, but they’re best recognized as the base for carbs like rice and spaghetti dishes. Tomatoes have a deep taste, a high water content, a soft flesh that breaks down easily, and the proper composition to thicken into a sauce without the use of thickeners. All of these characteristics make them great for easy-to-make sauces. INGREDIENTS METHOD Enjoy.
