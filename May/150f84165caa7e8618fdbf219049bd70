• ‘Southwest is playing dangerous, selfish politics’
• ‘North deploying manipulative tendency to outsmart South’
• ‘Igbo deserve a fair share of Nigeria’ Ahead of the next presidential elections, there are concerns that the South may go into the polls playing at the mercy of the North.  The North Central has two; Governor Yahaya Bello (Kogi) and Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim (Kwara).  The only person from the North East is Adamu Garba II (Adamawa). 
 
Former President Goodluck Jonathan and incumbent Governor of Central Bank, Godwin Emefiele are still being touted as possible contenders pending their declaration.  A Presidency source confided in The Guardian that the North is actually waiting for the South, particularly Southwest, to sort out itself and do some housekeeping to present one candidate.
  
They also expressed the concern that the Southeast only stands a chance in either APC or PDP if there is harmony among its presidential contenders on one hand and with the Southwest.
