Nigeria’s No 1 scrabble player, Eta Karo, has won the maiden edition of the West African Scrabble Championship, which ended in Accra, Ghana, during the week. Team Nigeria dominated the five-nation tournament, with Nwali Enoch and ex-scrabble World Champion, Jighere Wellington, finishing in second and third position at the tourney. The event also saw Nigeria standing high on points ahead of their opponents in Ghana. According to the Nigeria Scrabble Federation, the players that attended the West African tourney were among the top ten players at the competition, which featured over 50 scrabble players. The vice president of NSF, Bright Idahosa, said that the West African tourney was another platform for the country to maintain it’s pedigree in scrabble. “The championship was successful. Team Nigeria was able to show to the World that scrabble is in top level in our country. Our players did not disappoint. All we need to do as a Federation is to source for sponsors to develop the sport. There is great potential in Nigeria scrabble. We are rated among the best scrabble nation in the World. We are now West African champions,” he said. Nigeria, The Gambia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and host Ghana took part in the West African scrabble championship.
