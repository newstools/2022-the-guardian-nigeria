An All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftain in Imo State, Chief Tony Chukwu has apologized to the people of Okigwe district. Speaking to reporters, Chukwu admitted that he should not have supported senatorial candidates against the bloc in the past. The St Gregory knight noted that Okigwe, which comprises Okigwe and Onuimo Local Government Areas, has not produced a Senator yet Chukwu recalled how before Senator Athan Achonu was supported in 2015, he and others led a delegation to Okigwe to plead with them to support Achonu, who won. The philanthropist added that when it was the turn of Senator Benjamin Uwajumaogu and Senator Frank Ibezim, he did the same. Chukwu said ahead of the 2023 general elections, he would not approach the people with any candidate from outside the zone. He hailed the Okigwe Elders Forum led by HRH Eze Oliver Ohanaweh, monarchs, clerics and others for backing Okigwe for Senate. The people, according to the APC stalwart, will now have a sense of belonging and see other blocs as allies. “Mbano district (Isiala and Ehime) produced Senator Emeka Echeruo (1979-1983); Senator Agunanne (1992); Senator Ifeanyi Araraume (1999-2007); Senator Athan Achonu (2015-2016).and Senator Frank Ibeziem (2019-2023). “Etiti District; Senator S.N. Anyanwu (2009-2011), Senator Matthew Nwagwu (2011-2015) and Senator Benjamin Uwajumagu (2016-2019)”, he explained. Chukwu urged people from Mbano district and other areas to allow Okigwe to occupy the National Assembly seat in 2023. On Monday, the Okigwe Elders Forum met in Owerri and zoned various elective positions for the sake of equity. In attendance were Prof. Maurice Iwu, HRH Eze Eddy Okeke, Dr. Edwin Anyanwu, HRH Eze B. N. Njoku; Dr. Ikedi Ohakim, Hon. Chike Okafor, Hon. Princess Miriam Onuoha and several others.
