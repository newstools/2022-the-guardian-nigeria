Nigeria is a ‘Country of the Young’. As per the latest UNICEF reports, there are approximately 31 million children aged less than 5 years, and each year at least 7 million more babies are born in Nigeria. 27th May marks the occasion of National Children’s Day – a day to cherish and celebrate these little wonders of our nation. Our children are the future leaders and decision-makers and it is important to nurture them with this long-term vision. Every element of childhood – from growing in the womb to playing and exploring in early childhood, as well as from learning in school to preparing for maturity and career – is built on the foundation of good health! Good nutrition during early childhood plays a vital role in determining a child’s overall health, achieving optimal growth and development as well as developing cognitive abilities to their full potential. The First Five Years of Life – A Window of Opportunity?
<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1762946 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-37.png" alt="" width="936" height="482" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-37.png 936w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-37-320x165.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-37-640x330.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-37-600x309.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" />The early childhood phase i.e., up to 5 years of age, observes maximum brain development and maturity. By the age of one, a child will complete roughly 72% of their brain development and nearly 90% by the age of five. Nerves develop, link, and get enveloped in myelin, forming the systems that determine how a kid thinks and feels. These linkages and modifications have an impact on sensory systems, acquisition, memory, cognition, processing speed, impulse control, mood control, and even the ability to multitask. The extent to which the brain grows and develops throughout these crucial years can have long-term consequences for their life. Optimal neurodevelopment is vastly dependent upon the availability of various nutrients. Good nutrition is critical to ensure that the brain and nervous system can develop to its full potential. Among the various brain-supportive nutrients like DHA, Iron, Selenium, Choline, Taurine, Iodine, etc., docosahexaenoic acid – DHA is the key nutrient. to promote brain development and support a child’s cognitive abilities like learning, understanding, thinking, and other higher functions. DHA is an important structural element of the nervous system and it accounts for approximately 40% of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in a completely matured brain. DHA is also required for carrying out various neurodevelopmental functions like synapse formation,  myelination, neurogenesis, etc. It is possible to leverage this window of opportunity for brain development by ensuring DHA sufficiency during the first five years of life! Including DHA in Children’s Diet
DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid, an essential nutrient for brain phospholipids and retina. DHA can be obtained from breast milk or infant formula during infancy. Later on, as the child begins to start eating solids, he/she can be introduced to DHA-rich foods like fatty fish. Even then, an average Nigerian diet, that is rich in meat, vegetables, and carbohydrates is insufficient to meet the daily requirement of DHA for growing children. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1762947 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-38.png" alt="" width="936" height="446" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-38.png 936w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-38-320x152.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-38-640x305.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-38-600x286.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" />Including Peak 456 Growing Up Milk with DHA in daily diet is a great way to support DHA sufficiency in growing children for their optimal brain development. Clinically Studied Benefits of DHA In Growing Children The DHA Oxford Learning and Behavior (DOLAB) study on normal but underperforming children discovered that DHA supplementation improved their reading and behaviour dramatically. Supplementing with DHA-rich fish oil is demonstrated to moderate the perceived hyperactivity, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, impulsiveness, and anger in children. The human body is capable of synthesizing various nutrients on its own, but synthesizing the required level of DHA from its precursors, i.e. α-linolenic acid (ALA) is difficult. It is thus essential to secure the recommended amount of DHA from the diet. Children during their early days require sufficient DHA to support their brain, ocular and nervous system development. Whenever dietary patterns do not provide adequate levels of DHA to growing children, it may be prudent to include specially formulated age-appropriate Peak 456 Growing Up Milk with DHA in their daily diet. This Children’s Day, let’s ensure #BetterNutritionForEveryChild with Peak 456 Growing Up Milk and help them grow up strong and smart with the DHA advantage! <img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-1762955 aligncenter lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-598x598.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-1152x1152.jpg 1152w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-58x58.jpg 58w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-116x116.jpg 116w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39-600x600.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-39.png 1298w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" />
