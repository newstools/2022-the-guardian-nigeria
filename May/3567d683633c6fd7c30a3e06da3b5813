Nonso describes “Different” as “…the feeling you get when you meet a girl you like in a room filled with other beautiful women – and how she stands out from the rest and makes you want to chase after her.” The catchy and vibrant record highlights the fusion of R&B and Afrobeats with fellow Toronto-based sensations Majid Jordan assisting Nonso on the single.
