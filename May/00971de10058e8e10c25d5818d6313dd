Bolu Essien and Juliana Oloyede The riveting documentary which focused on de-stigmatizing the view that women who opt for Caesarean Section as a form of delivery are weak, first went viral online on March 11, 2022, when the Director/Producer, Bolu Essien posted a 1-minute trailer on her Twitter page @BoluEssien with the message, “As a mum who has had 6 layers of my abdominal wall opened to deliver my precious boy, I knew childbearing was a sacrifice for motherhood. Sadly, when I saw how these women were either called weak or stigmatized with statements like, ‘was it not your mate that pushed?’ I just knew I had to use my voice as a filmmaker to educate society on the matter”. A cross-section of guests at the screening From goosebumps to teary eyes, the atmosphere was completely saturated with varying degrees of emotions from the viewers who heaped praises on the Director, Bolu Essien, for being able to take on such a sensitive subject and
delivering it with absolute correctness. The documentary reached its climax when it revealed a live CS procedure carried out at the Lagoon Hospital, Lagos. The graphic content heightened the emotions in the theatre, and upon its completion, the viewers generated thunderous applause for the fascinating documentary and the perpetually brave and selfless mothers. Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer, Axa Mansard Health, Babatope Adeniyi, shared an almost bitter firsthand experience regarding the misconceptions, rampant ignorance, and sheer negligence of people in society regarding childbirth and how it has resulted in avoidable deaths. Chief Executive Officer, Axa Mansard Health, Babatope Adeniyi Chief Executive Officer, Axa Mansard Health, Babatope Adeniyi said, “We are very excited to have witnessed this excellent project and above all, its sublime storytelling. At Axa Mansard, we take health very seriously, and that is why most of our C-Level Executives have come to lend their voices and show support to this subject today.” “Discrimination against mothers who delivered through CS must stop. Women should be comfortable choosing whichever means of delivery they prefer without fear or reproach. There are two modes of childbirth, virginal and CS, neither is normal nor abnormal and they are both incredible sacrifices made by these women hence, they should be celebrated and not castigated,” Bolu Essien said in an interview. When asked about the distribution of the documentary, the Executive Producer, Emmanuel Essien said, “we look forward to announcing the home for Scars of Honour very soon so that everyone can access and relish this great work of art. We encourage key stakeholders to keep having these relevant conversations and consequently giving women the required support”.
