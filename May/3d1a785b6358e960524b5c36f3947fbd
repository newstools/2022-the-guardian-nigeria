It features a group of crooks, including Tokyo, an ex-soldier, band together under the direction of a mastermind known as the Professor to organize an unparalleled heist, taking money that has never been seen before. The trailer also features fan-favorite characters Professor (Yoo Ji-tae), Tokyo (Jung Jong-seo), and Berlin played by ‘Sqiud Games’ Park Hae-soo all dressed in the symbolic red jumpsuits and wearing traditional Hahoe masks.
The first peek video is now available. And on June 24, the K-drama remake “Money Heist: Korea Joint Economic Area Part 1” will air. The plot twist is that Korea is on the cusp of unification, and there is a Joint Security Area positioned where North and South Korea are divided today that contains a mint that becomes the focal point of the action. The mint is creating a new shared currency as part of the reunification process to set the stage for a strong combined economy. Given people’s dreams for unity, it appears that only the wealthy have prospered. Only a joint task force led by a South Korean negotiating specialist and a North Korean agent stands between the gangsters and their loot. Kim Hong-sun directed the new drama, which was produced by BH Entertainment and Zium Content for Netflix. “I was intrigued by the premise of the remake because not only is it about the conflict between robbers and police, but also it adds new layers such as the tension, mistrust, and harmony between North and South Korea,” said writer Ryu Yong-jae, who was also a big fan of the original Spanish series. “[It is] a situation where thieves from North and South Korea join forces, and police from North and South join hands to stop their way, [adding] a Korean lens to the original IP.” Only a joint task force led by a South Korean negotiating specialist and a North Korean agent stands between the gangsters and their loot.
