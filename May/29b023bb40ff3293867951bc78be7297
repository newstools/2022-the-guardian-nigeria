It is one of those cryptocurrencies that faced a hit during the May 2022 crypto crash. Beyond this, the price of Cardano (ADA) has been on a declining trend. Many crypto experts believe that Cardano (ADA) is dead. But few still support the argument that it will rise again. There is another option if the investors seek risk-free crypto. ADA can be replaced by today’s real world utility token “Chronoly (CRNO).” Let’s discuss. Will Cardano (ADA) Go Up Again?
Cardano (ADA) is a decentralized blockchain platform that focuses on smart contracts and security. It employs a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. It was developed in 2017, by Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Ethereum, and Jeremy Wood, both experienced cryptocurrency developers. Cardano (ADA) will launch Fund via its Project Catalyst platform in March 2022. The Project Catalyst innovation fund, used for protocol upgrades, allows Cardano (ADA) users to access resources paid in ADA. Cardano (ADA) Treasury’s Fund8 program will grant $16 million to several initiatives. For example, in February 2022, Cardano (ADA) will plant one million trees by collaborating with Veritree, a Canadian reforestation company. Users contributed one million ADA tokens to the planting of one million trees. In addition, each donor received a tree-planting certificate indicating the precise location of their trees and other details such as the kind of tree planted. Cardano (ADA) introduced SundaeSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) based on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain, on January 20, 2022, to promote liquidity on its network. In preparation for the event, ADA’s price reached a high of $1.63 on January 18. Furthermore, on January 17, 2022, Cardano (ADA) partnered with EMURGO to encourage the development of a community-generated and maintained tool stack to aid the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem and accelerate the development of decentralized applications. Based on the above points, Cardano (ADA) is a strong coin and could potentially rise slightly. What will Cardano (ADA) be in 2022
Wallet Investors consider ADA to be a solid long-term and short-term investment. They anticipated that Cardano (ADA) would reach $3.10 in a year and $10.46 in five years. Meanwhile, Coin Quora is highly optimistic that Cardano (ADA) will become a very bullish crypto asset after a year of monitoring its movements. They even predict that ADA will reach a price of $12 by the end of 2022. Coin Quora also stated that ADA would continue to rise in value in 2023, with a price target of $18. Coinpedia, on the other hand, considers Cardano (ADA) will continue its run that started in 2022. According to Coinpedia, ADA will begin trading in 2023 at a price between $0.3 and $0.7. In the event of bearish conditions on the ADA, they may see the coin’s value dropping below $0.3. What is Chronoly (CRNO) how does it work?
Chronoly (CRNO) is the platform that enables you to invest in expensive branded watches using the fractionalisation method. You will be the owner of part and parcel of a real-world watch. However, you can own a watch if you pay the price in full. The watch market is growing over time, and it is a great idea to provide unique opportunities to invest in it. On top of that, the project has also aligned with the Metaverse in the future. The holders would be able to showcase their collection and on their avatars.  They have their Marketplace where the watches in the form of NFTs would be traded. The ownership will be secured by the ERC-20 blockchain network built on Ethereum. Chronoly (CRNO) will overtake ADA
If you seek a 1000x return, Chronoly (CRNO) is the right option for you. The initial launch got the hype, and many tokens were already sold at $0.033. To date, over 65 million CRNO  have been sold in phase one. On May 5, 2022, the initial auction sold about 9.5 million CRNO tokens in the first minute of the presale. Crypto analysts worldwide estimate a gain of more than 9-times its value over the presale period alone. Presale: https://presale.chronoly.io/register
