Former Director General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr. Dakuku Peterside, has said the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom  Wike, should not expect him to keep quiet when the state is being robbed of its treasures. He described Wike as a colossal failure, whose only legacy was unbridled tyranny.  Peterside stated this in a statement, yesterday, in response to Wike’s remarks at a thanksgiving service held at St Paul’s Cathedral in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Sunday. Wike had, at thanksgiving service, berated Peterside for allegedly threatening the peace and stability of the state over the arrest and arraignment of Dagogo in court. The ex-NIMASA helmsman has been a strong critic of Wike’s administration. He explained, in the statement, that his criticism of the state government over the years was neither driven by personal ambition nor pecuniary consideration. Rather, he said, it was for his love for the state, which, unfortunately, he noted, had been robbed dry by the governor. “Maybe Wike wants me to keep quiet for making Port Harcourt the dirtiest city in Nigeria; making Rivers people personification of poverty; visiting untold hardship on our pensioners; or abandoning education,” he said. Peterside, who claimed that posterity would rate Wike Rivers’ the worst governor ever, said he would continue to upbraid him until he leaves office in 2023.
