Aspirant will restore lost glory, says ALGON ex-Chair, Adaramola Former Governor of Ekiti State and governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, has decried the rate of unemployment among youths in the state, as well as cybercrimes, popularly known as ‘yahoo yahoo.’ He said the level of joblessness could be linked to the rise in criminal activities, such as kidnapping, armed robbery and other unwholesome activities, promising to address the menace if elected as governor of the state in the June 18, 2022 governorship election. According to a statement issued by the spokesman of the Ekiti Build Back Better (EBBB), Mr. Idowu Adelusi in Ado-Ekiti yesterday, Oni stated this when delegates of the EBBB, a pro-Segun Oni Campaign group, paid him a solidarity visit at Ifaki-Ekiti. MEANWHILE, former Chairman of Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) in Ekiti State, Toba Adaramola, has said that Ekiti State would witness unprecedented and uncommon progress and development if Oni is given another opportunity to govern the state. In a statement made available to The Guardian in Ibadan, yesterday, Adaramola said that Oni had done it before in his brief stint as governor, emphasising that his works remained testaments to the fact that he has the interest of Ekiti sons and daughters at heart. He said: “He is passionate about transforming and positioning Ekiti State on the path of economic viability, social security and sustainable development. Adaramola, the SDP’s aspirant for Ekiti Central Federal Constituency I in the House of Representatives, said many factors would speak for Oni.  He stressed that the forthcoming election would be unusual, saying it would spring pleasant surprises.
