The Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) has disclosed plans to partner with the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and other sister agencies in the establishment of the Domestic Export Warehouse (DEW) at the seaports to tackle logistics challenges in the sector. The DEW project is a one-stop facility for the consolidation of export products, packaging, labeling, inspection, certification, fumigation and sealing of containers by customs before evacuation to seaports for shipment. The Executive Secretary of NSC, Emmanuel Jime, who stated this during an interactive meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of NEPC, Dr Ezra Yakusak, said the NSC is also working with other sister agencies in the transport sector for the establishment of the warehouses across the port. Jime noted that part of the responsibility of NSC in the establishment of DEW includes development of standard operating procedures in collaboration with critical agencies for the operation of the warehouses. He said the agency would provide guidelines for setting tariffs for the operation of DEW and address complaints that may arise between the DEW operators and exporters. He dropped the hint that NSC has recommended the usage of inland dry ports as DEW. Jime said as the port economic regulator, NSC is committed to creating a level playing field for the port service providers and users inclusive of Nigerian exporters assuring that they shall remain fair, unbiased, and ensure that decisions taken in the port sector are arrived at through the concession of majority stakeholders. He, however, expressed worry over the high level of non-compliance to trade rules by both importers and exporters, saying NSC is willing to collaborate with NEPC to address this challenge. He said the two agencies need to organise enlightenment seminars on the need for importers and exporters to imbibe ethics and integrity in international trade, stressing that NSC is fully committed to support all measures towards promoting non oil export in Nigeria.
