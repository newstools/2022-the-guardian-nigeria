Heard’s younger sister, testified in court with the resumption of the trial this week,  in the ongoing defamation dispute between Heard and ex-husband Depp. Henriquez claimed that she lived with Heard and Depp on and off during their relationship and considered Depp a brother. Henriquez testified about seeing Depp hurl a Red Bull can at his nurse, Debbie Lloyd, which Lloyd disputed during her evidence. Depp allegedly ran up a flight of steps toward Henriquez during the confrontation, according to Henriquez. “He comes up behind me, strikes me in the back. I hear Amber shout don’t hit my f****** sister. She smacks him, lands one,” Henriquez said. “By that time Johnny had already grabbed Amber by the hair with one hand and was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other.” Henriquez, who was cross-examined by Depp’s lawyer Rebecca Lecaroz, admitted to acting as a marriage counselor at times and siding with Depp in arguments. Henriquez was questioned by Lecaroz about why she backed her sister when she wanted to stay with Depp. “You wanted Ms. Heard to stay with Mr. Depp even after you saw him hit her, right?” Lecaroz asked. That’s really oversimplifying something that’s far from simple. Again, Amber was very much in love, so was Johnny. She’s telling me that she wants something. Whether or not I agreed to it or not, whether or not I was OK with what was happening, it wasn’t my place,” Henriquez testified. Multiple witnesses, including a makeup artist and an acting coach who worked with Heard and claimed to have seen her with injuries during her relationship with Depp, testified to the jury on Wednesday. After a May 2016 argument, witnesses alleged they saw Heard with injuries on her face, which led to Heard receiving a restraining order against Depp and the pair becoming divorced. Their testimony contradicts that of two Los Angeles Police Officers, who testified earlier in the trial that they did not notice any visible injuries on Heard’s face or any disarray in the former couple’s home.
