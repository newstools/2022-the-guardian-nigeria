Minister of Mines and Steel Development (MMSD), Olamilekan Adegbite, has revealed that the Federal Government will soon make the country a gold jewelry destination. The minister stated this during the graduation ceremony of the first batch of the gemstone and jewelry-making trainees of the Abuja Chambers of Commerce and Industry. He said the seven-month training was part of the Federal Government’s efforts at discouraging the exportation of raw ore and ensuring that whatever is produced in the country is also processed locally. This, according to him, would create jobs and wealth for the youth. Adegbite, in a statement issued by the ministry, said: “This programme was designed to impart knowledge on the participants so that they can make jewelry in Nigeria, we are going to retain our gold and gemstones in Nigeria; add value to it; sell to our people and export to other countries.” He added that Nigeria would soon be a gemstone and jewelry destination for other countries and that, in no distant time, the country would begin to export finished jewelry.
