Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has condemned the call by Ohanaeze Ndigbo for the arrest of its Director of Publicity and Advocacy, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed. The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation had slammed the NEF spokesman over his broadcast that Igbo should leave Nigeria, if they so desire. In a statement, yesterday, NEF convener and former Vice Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, urged Ohanaeze to focus on securing the South East from multiple threats and promoting Igbo relevance in Nigeria. He said: “My attention has been drawn to comments by spokesman of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr. Alex Ogbonnia, on the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of NEF, Dr. Baba-Ahmed. These comments are, to say the least, dangerous and irresponsible, designed to achieve only one goal: to put the life of Baba-Ahmed in peril. “NEF states categorically that all comments and statements made by Baba-Ahmed are authorised and represent its position. We are aware of attempts to create the impression that this statement is recent, as well as other attempts to misrepresent its contents to create scapegoats for the failure to limit the damage of irredentism. Despite many efforts to inform the public appropriately, it appears that Ohanaeze Ndigbo has fallen prey to more mischief, or is itself actively involved in incitement against a citizen.” The Forum sees the claim that Baba-Ahmed is a security risk and the demand for his arrest as “pathetic and beneath even the ordinary standards of Ohanaeze. It affirms its full confidence in Baba-Ahmed, adding that he would continue to serve the country and the North, “as we search for a future that accommodates all interests in Nigeria.”
