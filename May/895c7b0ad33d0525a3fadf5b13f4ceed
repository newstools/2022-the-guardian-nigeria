For more context, MI had revealed that he was denied access to Rick Ross during the rapper’s visit to Nigeria via Twitter. His tweets came moments after Ycee called out organisers of the American rapper Rick Ross’ Easter concert for not having any rappers in the show’s lineup. “Bruh this ain’t even about me cos I haven’t put out rap music in a while but how do you have a Rick Ross show in Nigeria and not have ONE SINGLE NIGERIAN RAPPER ON THE LINE UP??? And tomorrow you wanna come on Twitter and ask why rappers are switching genres,” he tweeted. Supporting Ycee’s claims, MI had tweeted, “My first big gig ever was in 2008 with Jay Z and Rihanna and Usher.. how I was treated that day taught me a valuable lesson.. them no go respect us.. until we respect ourselves.” “Lastly .. I was invited to meet Rick Ross.. I responded by saying if I could do it one on one. Ofcourse they declined.. the afrobeats industry will not respect Hiphop just because.. that’s fine. Let’s accept it as what it is and make GREAT MUSIC FOR THE ONES who do care.” MI And Joey Akan Just months after this went down, rapper Da Baby visited Nigeria at Davido’s invitation. Joey Akan took to Twitter to “mock” MI’s claims that rappers are not given a place in the Nigerian music industry. He tweeted, “Why is Dababy not having one-on-one with local Nigerian rappers? No meet-and-greet? No hailings? “wE nEeD tHE CUltuRe to resPect Nigerian wrappers.” You rappers should go and drag Davido na. Since entitlement is usually your first name.” Not one to back down from a challenege, MI quoted Akan’s tweet writing “you have a small mind.. so not sure you understand what false equivalency is.. What’s d point of dis tweet? To insult rappers for wanting respect? I guess self respect would be an offensive idea to you. Insecure little Joey insulting people to feel better grow up” Following MI’s response, the two entered into an exchange of words and Akan accused MI Abaga of trying to ruin the career of his signees. “I’ve stood you up 3 times M.I, when you wanted to use me to attack an artist, you ruined their career. I refused, and you’ve hated me for it. Leaking dirt on your artists to further damage their career. You know why I never attended those meetings? Because you’re evil,” Akan tweeted. Spilling more tea, he continued “Stop doing this. Did you try to use me as a tool to destroy an artist that once called you father? And ate from the same plate as you? I ghosted you because you wanted to compromise me for evil. Answer the question. And stop calling me and threatening me. Vector was right.” MI then tweeted that Akan was no longer welcomed in Nigerian HipHop. “We spoke on the phone.. and you called Nigerian rappers poor and depressed. You are no longer welcome in our culture.. good bye @JoeyAkan.” “Let it be known that @JoeyAkan is an enemy of Nigerian HipHop! A vile mind that continuously spits on our efforts and debases the Hiphop community! You are persona non grata and no longer welcome in the culture.” While the origin of the seeming “beef” between both MI and Joey Akan is unclear, it would not be wrong to conclude that both parties are not on good terms and this outburst might not be their first exchange of words.
