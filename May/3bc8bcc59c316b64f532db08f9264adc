Sir: It is heart rendering that a young lady who was a student of Sokoto College of Education was murdered in cold blood just for standing by her faith. Initially, what the news said was that she insulted the prophet and whoever had listened to that news must have blamed Deborah Yakubu for not being circumspect and cautious. But the truth later surfaced that her only offence was that she attributed her success in her exams to Jesus and that was what angered those who dragged her out of her hostel, beat her to death and lynched her. This is cruelty of the highest order and everyone must rise up to ensure that the perpetrators never go scot-free. Also culpable are the school’s security personel who ought to have prevented such dastardly act from taking place within their vicinity. Even though there is nothing that can bring back the dead lady but there are certain things to do to make sure that she didn’t die in vain. First is the prosecution of all those involved in her gruesome murder as stressed above. Another step is to immortalise her by renaming the hostel from where she was dragged out, beaten to death and burnt after her. May the almighty God console Deborah’s parents and give them the fortitude to bear the sudden loss of their fearleass daughter.
