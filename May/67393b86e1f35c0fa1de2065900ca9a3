Apart from the contentious issue of zoning, there are some crucial red lines limiting the progression of various presidential aspirants. Although it is universally accepted that age is not only a number, but also a matter of the mind, age is among the considerations in the two major political parties-the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The unwritten code seems to be that President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor should not be above 65 years of age.
   
A Presidential aspirant on the platform of APC, Senator Robert Ajayi Borofice, said the issue of age is not absolute. He said: “I don’t think I am the oldest and age to me is just statistics. As a scientist, you have what is called the calendar age and you have what is called biological age.    
   
“You may be 70 by your calendar age, but by your biological age, you may be 60. You may be 60 by your calendar age, but you may be 70 by your biological age. So, I am 73years old, but I believe that I still have the intellect and the capability of someone, who is between 65 and 70.
   
“In any case, look at (Joe) Biden, one of the most powerful Presidents in the world, he is 78years and there are many other examples, which I don’t want to cite. Even in Asia, there was a President, who was 80years old.
   
“So, I don’t think age is an issue, I am sure you are looking at me now, I don’t look like an old man, who has lost his senses. I think that, to me, age is not a barrier.”
  
Just as Borofice, the two other notable aspirants whose age has been under reference are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. State governors elected on their party platforms, PDP and APC, as well as other stakeholders hold the view that the two men should take a deserved rest. But, while opposition to Tinubu is strong among APC stalwarts, Atiku has continued to mitigate the impact of age on his ambition.
   
Recently, a former Cross River State governor, Donald Duke, criticised Atiku’s continued aspiration for the Presidency after 30 years, stressing that quite unlike Abraham Lincoln, who made only two attempts for the United States Presidency, Atiku has been contesting for Nigeria’s Presidency since 1992.
  
Again, despite the initial grandstanding, back and forth about zoning, the general mood of the country and within the leading political platforms is in favour of electing the next President from the Southern part f the country.
  
However, as debatable as the issue of age is, there are other salient points being weighed as the two parties get ready to select their standard bearers for next year’s presidential poll.
 
Some of these criteria include, requisite experience, political clout, alertness and knowledge of crucial issues dogging Nigeria’s socio-economic development. The following are how those odds and circumstances impact on the frontline presidential aspirants in the two parties:  Osinbajo   Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation  <img loading="lazy" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1187508 lazyload" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Emeka-Nwajiuba-1-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" />Dr. Emeka Nwajiuba
NWAJIUBA is one of the acolytes of former Senate President, the late Chuba Okadigbo. He holds a Ph.D in Law. After practicing for years, Nwajiuba joined the All Peoples Party (APP) on which platform he contested and won the Okigwe North federal constituency seat for the House of Representatives.
 
Nwajiuba served as chairman, House Committee on Lands, Housing and Works.
 
In 2003, 2007 and 2011, he unsuccessfully contested the Imo State governorship. As part of the merger committee of legacy political parties that formed APC, Nwajiuba was Secretary of Constitution drafting committee that produced the party’s constitution.
  
Between 2017 and 2019, Nwanjiuba served as chairman of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund), from where he contested and won the Okigwe North Federal Constituency election to the House of Representatives on the platform of Accord Party (AP), after some misunderstanding with Governor Rochas Okorccha.
   
His stay in the Green chamber was however cut short, after President Buhari nominated him as Minister of State for Education. Nwajiuba would be 55 by August 20. On the strike action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Nwajiuba pleaded with the striking lecturers to resume academic work in the interest of youths, stressing that his children were also victims.
  
Not minding his claim of being indirectly affected, Nwajiuba is being taunted by the deplorable state of university education in the country, especially the prolonged ASUU strike action on the educational development of Nigerian youths. Apart from his strong links to Buhari, his broad pan-Nigerian outlook is suspect.  Fayemi. Photo/facebook/JKayodeFayemi   Wike. Photo/ facebook/GovernorNyesomEzenwoWikeCON   Obi  In 2019 former Vice President Atiku Abubakar selected Obi as his Presidential running mate in their eventful but unsuccessful run for the Presidency.
    
Last Month Obi declared his interest to contest the 2023 Presidential election, even as he continues to complain about the state of Nigeria’s economy. The former Anambra State governor was in No 10 Downing Street, the sit of United Kingdom government, where he conferred with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson.
  
Five years ago, Obi was also in United States of America, where he met with former House of Representatives Speaker, Paul Ryan. Apart from demonstrating his clout as a global citizen, Obi has been using his foreign travels to draw attention to the grave economic situation of the country.
   
Despite his international connections and knowledge in comparative economic development indices, Obi is seen as an outside in PDP politics. His penny-pinching habit tends to ostracise him from mercantilist politics. But going from a known platform (PDP) to a relatively unknown others could further limit his reach, despite social media ratings.  Former Nigeria’s Senate President  Bukola Saraki  He had a turbulent tenure as President of Senate in President Buhari’s first term, when he plotted and appropriated the selection process out of the hands of a docile party leadership. That audacity caused him to sweat as state orchestrated probes dragged to the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), for discrepancies in his asset declaration forms when he served as governor. He triumphed. Perhaps, a concerned northern establishment might juggle the cards to favour his middle ground orientation.  [FILES] Atiku.

The late Sage and political leader of the Southwest was the most prepared for national leadership among the politicians of his era. But he didn’t get there. However, if matters were left for market forces to determine, Tinubu remains a great force.
