The over 260 young farmers, who left Enugu for Keffi, Nasarawa State, two weeks ago for training at CSS Global Farms, under the sponsorship of the Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi led administration, have returned safely to the state, thanking Ugwuanyi for rebranding and enhancing their skills in the agricultural value chain. The excited and fulfilled-looking beneficiaries, including Reverend Sisters, who arrived Enugu yesterday, moved straight to the Government House in a joyful mood to appreciate the governor for the opportunity his administration gave them. Speaking on their behalf, Ikenna Ugwuanyi appreciated the governor for believing so much in the youth and extolled his administration’s commitment to youth empowerment in the state. Ikenna described the training as “two weeks of dedication; two weeks of rebranding; two weeks of mental training; two weeks of intense agricultural practice.” He further noted: “There is no one of us who is a graduate of CSS Global Farms, Keffi, today that will not attest to the fact that, for two weeks, we have learnt a new normal in our lives courtesy of Ugwuanyi’s administration.”
