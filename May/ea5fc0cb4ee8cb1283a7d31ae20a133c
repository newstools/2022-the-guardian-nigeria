Bauchi State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bappa Misau, has promised presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, that all the delegates from Bauchi will vote for him at the primary poll. Misau, on behalf of the delegates, told Tinubu, yesterday, in Bauchi: “All the delegates are yours. It is only traditional that you come to Bauchi. But even if you didn’t come, all the delegates in Bauchi are yours because you laid the foundation.” Tinubu, on his part, urged the delegates to look at the “capacity, quality and brilliance” he displayed as Governor of Lagos State and give him support to emerge the party’s candidate. As one of those aspiring to be President of Nigeria, he said with their support, he was sure of victory.His words: “I have demonstrated my capacity, quality and brilliance in governance in Lagos. I have been a very successful private sector person, who worked for ExxonMobil as Auditor-General, became the Treasurer and joined politics. This is not a small thing.” Tinubu, who urged the delegates to give him their support, said he was out to serve the country and nothing more. “I want Nigeria to change the education of our children, security of lives and property, giving priority to those items. Then, helping the farmers bring commodity exchange, help those who are extremely poor, give priority to power generation for industrial growth. “To all of you, I don’t have to sell too much of myself; I have a very good name recognition. I brought the party (APC) together and determined to build a nation of great people. We are not poor by all means; we can bring prosperity to Nigeria with good thinking,” he added.
