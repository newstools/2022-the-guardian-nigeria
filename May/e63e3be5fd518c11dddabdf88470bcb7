Renaissance Group for Better Nigeria has alleged a plot to frustrate the release of former governors of Taraba State, Rev. Jolly Nyame, and Plateau State, Joshua Dariye as well as 152 others. Nyame, Dariye and others were recently granted pardon by the National Council of State (NCS) on account of ill health and other reasons. The group, in a statement signed by its Chairman, Jonathan Ibrahim, expressed surprise and disappointment that over two weeks after the pardon, “nothing has been done to effect their release.” According to the group, there should be no need for delay since the pardon was granted by the highest decision-making body in the country, adding that the decision is supposed to be acted upon without much ado to avoid a negative impression. “We are surprised that they are still being held and many Nigerians, especially their loved ones, are beginning to have the impression that they are still being held for certain political reasons, which are not clear to many. “We are, therefore, calling on all relevant authorities, especially the Ministry of Justice, to do all that that is required to facilitate their release, to avoid unnecessary insinuation. Moreso, their political associates and families are anxiously waiting for their arrival,” it stated. The group, therefore, appealed to the authority concerned, especially the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, to expedite action on their release.
