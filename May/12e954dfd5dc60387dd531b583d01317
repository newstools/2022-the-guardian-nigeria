Still savouring the euphoria of the country’s record-breaking performance at the 19th International School Sport Federation (ISF) Gymnasiade in Normandy, France, Nigeria School Sport Federation (NSSF) President, Olabisi Joseph, has called on governments at all levels and the corporate sector to help develop the sport at the grassroots level. Nigeria broke a 50-year jinx at the 19th ISF Gymnasiade and put the country back on the international school sports map. With 10 athletes competing in athletics events, Nigeria won one gold medal in 3000m to finish 21st on the medals table in the competition, which featured thousands of athletes from 63 countries in 20 events. Six of the athletes made it to the final of their various events, while Ronke Akanbi of Yewa College claimed the only gold medal for Nigeria in the girls’ 3000. Speaking during a reception for the 10 Nigerian athletes in the just concluded ISF event, NSSF President, Olabisi Joseph, said: “We are so excited with the performance of the athletes that with little training, they were able to rub shoulders with their counterparts across the globe. “For most of the athletes, this will probably be the first time they are travelling outside the country and with the unfriendly weather in France, they held sway against their counterparts which for us as a federation has shown that with quality preparation, we can have our athletes making it to the podium in most of the events.”
   
She said Nigeria had not participated in the event in the last 50 years, adding that the gold medal broke the jinx in France.
 
“I am proud of our children, getting to France, they competed with their counterparts from 63 other countries across the world. On the general medals table, we are 21st, even though we participated in one event out of the 20, we still made it to the medal table and it is something commendable.
