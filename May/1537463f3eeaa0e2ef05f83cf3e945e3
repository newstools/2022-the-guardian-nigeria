 Burna Boy and Stefflon Don | Photo – Nigeria News Update Burna Boy and Stefflon Don | Photo – Nigeria News Update Stefflon Don has shared her side of the story on her breakup with Burna boy in a ‘diss track’ First of All.   The singer uploaded the almost two minutes long video on YouTube today after dropping a teaser of the track on Thursday. In the song’s teaser shared on her socials, Steff said it was time for her to tell her “side of the story”, which many presumed to be all the hot gist about her breakup with Burna. However, on the track, she raps a bunch of gibberish and basically asks everyone to mind their business after stringing everyone for the whole day about the song’s drop. In all honesty, this comes as a surprise as many had expected Steff to spill it all, but commendably, she chose to be the bigger person. Listen to First of All:
