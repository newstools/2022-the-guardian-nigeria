• To Rehabilitate Apapa, Tincan Port
The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has revealed plans to reduce the cost of shipping in Nigeria with the deployment of more digital technology and critical facilities at the nation’s seaports.
  
Managing Director, NPA, Mohammed Bello-Koko, during a media parley in Lagos, said the authority is about to deploy the port community system whereby every stakeholder is locked into one system for operations. 
  
Bello-Koko said the port community system would not affect the e-customs, adding that it would enhance trade facilitation and ease shipping processes.  Also, he said NPA is pushing for construction of a deep seaport in Bonny Island, Rivers State. All these, according to him are to ensure that Nigeria returns as the maritime hub in the continent.
  
He said the issue of staff welfare is also being taken care of, with provision of training, health facilities, computers and digital materials, and sport facilities, among others.
