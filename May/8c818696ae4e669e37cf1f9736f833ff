 Charles Granville Notable Nollywood filmmaker and entrepreneur, Charles Granville, has been selected amongst a few other Africans to receive an honorary doctorate degree by Highstone International University, California, United States. The school announced the honour as part of its programme to encourage excellence in leadership and to acknowledge the contributions of respected and distinguished men and women, whose efforts are helping towards building a better world. This is probably the first time a Nollywood personality will be so honoured by the school, which had in the past recognised high net-worth individuals drawn from academia, business, philanthropy and leadership in Africa. This honour is coming on the heels of Granville’s appointment as International Peace and Governance Council, IPGC’S Special Envoy to ECOWAS, which conferred on him the powers and privileges as the IPGC ambassador on Investment Cooperation in Africa. The filmmaker behind such movies as Locked and 30 Pieces of Silver, had earlier been decorated as ‘Man of the Year’ (Man magazine); ‘Special Mention Award’ at Abuja International Film Festival 2020 (Locked); ‘Best Movie Producer 2020’ (The Intellects Award); and ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ (Nigerian Achievers’ Awards). Currently working on his latest film, titled, I’m in Charge, slated for release in 2022 and starring Funke Akindele-Bello and Richard Mofe-Damijo, Granville says the honour by the US-based university, just like the recognitions he had previously gotten is a call to do more. “It feels good to be recognised and points to the fact that what one is doing is good. I am committed to a better world and call on other celebrities to join in making the world better,” he said.
