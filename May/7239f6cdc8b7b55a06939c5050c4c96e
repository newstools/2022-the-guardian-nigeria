Despite promises of digital revolution and claims of successes by the government, stakeholders at this year’s Digital Rights and Inclusion Forum said that little has been achieved in the country compared to other climes.
   
They called on the government to partner industry players to avoid being left behind. This comes as Paradigm Initiative through its capacity-building initiative said it has continued to connect underprivileged young Africans to digital opportunities and prepare them to compete for jobs, internships and other productive endeavours.
   
The group said with an unemployment rate of 33 per cent, with 42 per cent male youth, Nigeria is similar to many other African countries where the youth joblessness continues to grow but jobs remain a major challenge. It said its Life Skill, ICTs, Financial literacy, and Entrepreneur, dubbed LIFE programme addresses this problem through the provision of digital literacy and entrepreneurship skills for underserved youth because absence of these skills denies youth the opportunity to thrive in the digital space and increases the number of unemployed youth, especially in the marginalised population.  “We are celebrating 15 years; we started as ajegunle.org, so, we are measuring the impact we have had for the past 15 years and looking towards the next 15 years. We want to go to more communities, more countries; we are targeting to train, support and impact millions.”
   
On his part, Programme Manager, Paradigm Initiative, Tosin Abolaji, said: “We train people, we don’t only create awareness; we as well equip people so they can understand how to use technology. After awareness and training, we create conducive training centres where these young people don’t have to pay a dime for coming into the facility to learn, use the devices and get them connected.
