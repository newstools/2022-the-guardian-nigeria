The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) reopened in a downturn yesterday, as losses in Presco MTN Nigeria and 15 stocks dragged market capitalisation by N169 billion, following profit taking by investors. At the close of transactions yesterday, the All Share Index (ASI) decreased by 313.16 absolute points, representing a dip of 0.58 per cent to close at 53,772.14 points. Similarly, the market capitalisation lost N169 billion to close at N28.989 trillion. The downturn was impacted by losses recorded in medium and large capitalised stocks, amongst which are; Presco, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Stanbic IBTC Holdings, Lafarge Africa and University Press. Going into the week, analysts at United Capital Plc expect sentiments to remain soft and possibly support further profit-taking, particularly, if fixed-income yields continue to surge in light of the MPR rate hike, saying
“Nevertheless, we advise investors not to panic and rather take advantage of the dip to increase positions in attractively priced fundamental stocks.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was positive as 25 stocks gained while 17 others depreciated in price. Presco led the losers’ chart with 10 per cent, to close at N162.
