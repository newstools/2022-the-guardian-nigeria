 Tory Lanez – Ice Cream Convos Tory Lanez was temporarily detained at a Las Vegas airport after marijuana was allegedly found on him by Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents.   According to TMZ, the rapper was reportedly detained at the travel hub in the early hours of Sunday morning when authorities found a large amount of weed in his bag. However, Lanez was allowed to leave after some time without the marijuana he was carrying. Soon after his release, Lanez shared a series of posts on his Instagram Story promoting a gig he was booked for that night at the Drai nightclub at Caesar’s Palace. “Vegasssss I’ll be in the f—ing city tonight!!!!!!’ he said in one post, as he added in another: “Vegasssss @DraisLV Letssss f— thiiissss upppppppp tonighhhttt.” His reported detainment on Sunday comes nearly a month after he was taken into custody and released on bond for violating court orders. The Say It rapper had been prohibited from contacting Megan Thee Stallion, who claimed he shot at her and disclosing any new developments in the case to outside parties, which he violated. Lanez is also scheduled to appear in court in September.
