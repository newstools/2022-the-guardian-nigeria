Death struck the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) last week when it lost its oldest staff and former cricketer, Babatunde Elliot, 58, also known as Dealer. Elliot reportedly died on Thursday after closing of work at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) where he had worked for over 23 years as a groundsman. Facility manager at the TBS Oval, Richson Tetteh, said Elliot had a medical condition that the Federation was aware of and supported his treatment, adding, “his death shocked everyone that worked closely with him, given that he has been doing fine of late.” ‘Dealer’ was one of the most committed staff on the employment of the federation, as he was known for being passionate while dispensing his job. “Dealer is known here for being passionately committed to keeping the grounds clean. He is not compelled, he does it willingly and he will be greatly missed,” Tetteh said. As a form of honour for the departed groundsman, all weekend matches at the Club Cricket Committee (CCC) League observed a minute silence and wore black armbands.
