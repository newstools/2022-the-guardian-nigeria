• We want better leaders in 2023, says Masari Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, yesterday, granted a state pardon to 90 inmates across Kano correctional centres as part of activities marking Eid-el-Fitr. Announcing the state pardon when he led members of his cabinet on a Sallah visit to Gorondutse Correctional Centre, Kano, he disclosed that the gesture was in line with the teachings and spirit of Ramadan. The governor, who earlier admonished the inmates on reflection of good moral conduct, stressed the need to extend the state’s prerogative of mercy. He reminded them that the pardon was not only meant to decongest correctional centres, but to also give the inmates another opportunity to turn a new leaf and dignified character in life. ON his part, Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State has encouraged the residents to embrace peace. After observing the two rakka’at prayers at the Lapai Eid Prayer Ground in Lapai Local Council of the state, Bello charged the people to be mindful of happenings in their domains, especially with present security challenges. “My Sallah message to the people is that of peace and for the people to be very conscious of what is happening,” he said. The governor hopes that the benefit and blessings of this year’s Ramadan will end the security challenges in some parts of the country. NORTH Central Peoples’ Forum (NCPF) has expressed optimism that having tabled Nigerian security challenges before God during Ramadan, he will change the turn of the country into productive individuals. The Chairman, Chief Gabriel Aduku, made this known in his Sallah message to Muslims, which was made available to The Guardian in Abuja, yesterday. His words: “My earnest belief, however, is that, with this year’s successful completion of the Ramadan, and having tabled those challenges of insecurity, unemployment, poverty, inequality, bad leadership and others that have defied human solutions before Allah (SWA), who hears prayers, he shall grant our country the needed succour.” Niger State Police Command has reiterated its readiness to provide adequate security during the Sallah celebration and beyond. According to the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Wasiu Abiodun, the command has emplaced aggressive patrols, stop-and-search, and show of strength with other security agencies to ensure security before, during and after the festive season. The statement added that sufficient deployment of police personnel and operational assets to prayer grounds, recreation centres, parks and other public places across the 25 local councils in the state.

While felicitating the Muslim world on the 1443 AH Eid el-Fitr, the speaker urged traders to desist from an arbitrary increase in the price of food items. In a statement signed by his media and publicity aide, Ibrahim Danfulani, the speaker prayed to God to grant everyone the opportunity to witness many more celebrations. MEANWHILE, Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, has made case for competent and better leaders next year. The governor stated this shortly after observing the Eid prayers led by Malam Mukhtar Usman at the Shehu Usmanu Bin-Fodiyo Jumu’at Mosque, Modoji Area, in the state capital. Masari also urged Nigerians not to relent in their prayers for the peace and stability of the country, especially for divine intervention in the security challenges bedevilling the country.
