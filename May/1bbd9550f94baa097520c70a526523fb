The Peoples Democratic Governorship Aspirant in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, who has been in police detention for six days, has fallen ill and was taken to the hospital. His media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, said, Dagogo complained of stomach and chest complications which made the police to rush him to an undisclosed hospital where he is taking treatments. “He is responding to treatments now and he is fine, there is no cause for alarm,” the state police spokesperson, Grace Iringe Koko, said. Lawal accused Governor Nyesom Wike and his Camp Commandant, Efeturi Irikefe of planning to pin criminal charges on Dagogo, who currently represents Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. “We received from source that Governor Wike and his Camp Commandant, is stopping at nothing to put Dagogo in perpetual detention and they have already manufactured more charges of murder, kidnap, armed robbery, illegal bunkering and attacks on security agencies among other trump up charges to be hung on the neck of the Governorship hopeful,” Lawal said. ‘Having seen their initial trump up charges flopped spectacularly ,the State Governor and his goons, the Camp Commandant of Government House, Efeturi Irikefe, are hatching an attack on the State Criminal Investigation Department where Dagogo is being illegally held and accused the Federal Lawmaker of being the mastermind in a desperate move to change the narrative” He further alleged that the state is also planning to arrest and harm the families of Dagogo, his staff, particularly his aides and others close to him. “For the umpteenth time, our earlier position stands that Dagogo’s life is still in danger, this time, with that of his families, close friends, associates and his staff, particularly his aides. Lawal said, the Governor and his goons should be held responsible should anything untoward happens to Dagogo and others listed above.
