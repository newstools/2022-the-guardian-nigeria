Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have arrested serving Accountant General of the Federation (AGF), Ahmed Idris, in connection with diversion of funds and money laundering activities to the tune of N80 billion. He was arrested yesterday in Kano State and was immediately moved to Abuja last night. EFCC spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, confirmed the arrest in a statement. He said the funds were allegedly laundered through real estate investments in Kano and Abuja. “The Commission’s verified intelligence showed that the AGF raked off the funds through bogus consultancies and other illegal activities using proxies, family members and close associates,” Uwujaren said. According to sources, after progress was made in the investigation, Idris was summoned repeatedly by EFCC for interrogation but he failed to honour the invitations. “We kept inviting him but he kept dodging us. We were left with no choice than to keep him under watch and arrest him,” the source said. President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Idris as AGF on June 25, 2015. The position became vacant at the time after the former Accountant General, Jonah Otunla, left office on June 12, 2015. President Buhari reappointed Idris for a second four-year term in June 2019, amid criticisms from labour groups, who said the accountant-general should retire after turning 60. A source said the AGF should have retired more than a year ago as a cvil servant, “but when he clocked 60, the President’s men caused an extension. Now see the result of an illegal extension. It was the same time the tenure of Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) was extended too by the President against public service rule.” Idris, a native of Kano, was born on November 25, 1960, and was until his appointment in 2015 the Director of Finance and Accounts, Federal Ministry of Mines and Steel Development.
