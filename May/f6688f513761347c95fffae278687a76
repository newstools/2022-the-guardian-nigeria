As a way of making imported used vehicles affordable in the country, the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) has called on the Federal Government to reduce the levy on used cars payable in the re-launched Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) from 15 per cent to five per cent. The Public Relations Officer, Tin Can Island Port Chapter, ANLCA, Onome Monije, while explaining that with the new policy, imported vehicles may be unaffordable to Nigerians, called on the Federal Government to slash the levy to make the cost bearable. Monije, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of Onas 100 Resources Nigeria Limited, said freight agents were ready to abide by the new regime so long its intention is for trade facilitation, and accurate revenue generation for the government. According to her, the VIN valuation is a welcome development for vehicular importation into the country, noting that freight agents have engaged their importers and car dealers on the importance of a new VIN valuation. “The VIN valuation for us is not as if there is an increment in charges or tariff, some prices are really intact but the only concern we are looking at is the aspect of import levies. For VIN, we have no issue but the levy, because it is not about us the agents or Customs but for the government to look into the levy by reducing it to five per cent instead of 15 per cent. “Some cars are stuck in the port because of the levies. It is not that we are crying more than the bereaved but this is our country and we need to look at the holistic approach on the levies and look at how best we can reduce it,” she added.
