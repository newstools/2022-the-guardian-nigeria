The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) witnessed the first decline since April 7, 2022 to end 18 consecutive sessions of gain yesterday, following renewed profit taking by investors. The development caused market capitalisation to depreciate by N52 billion to close at N27.929 trillion, while the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 97.07 absolute points, representing a decrease of 0.19 per cent to close at 51,805.41 points. The market loss was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks among which are; MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Nigerian Breweries, Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO), Wema Bank and Zenith Bank. Analysts at Afrinvest Limited said: “In the next trading session, we expect the market performance to remain bearish of the absence of any positive catalyst.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “With the market closing in negative territory on the back of the loss on MTNN, we foresee a rebound in tomorrow’s session, as investors buy up some of the fundamentally sound names which lost in today’s trading session.” However, market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive as 36 stocks gained while 13 others depreciated in price. May & Baker Nigeria, Multiverse Mining and Exploration and Okomu Oil recorded the highest price gain of 10 per cent each to close at N4.84 kobo, 22 kobo and N187.
