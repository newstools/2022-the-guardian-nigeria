Catholic priest dies in Kaduna kidnappers’ den Gunmen, yesterday, killed six soldiers and a mobile police officer, just as they reportedly abducted the Commanding Officer (CO) of the 92 Battalion in Takum Local Council of Taraba State. This came not long after President Muhammadu Buhari charged the military to smoke out the terrorists wherever they were and eliminate them. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Taraba command, Usman Abdullahi, said that killing of the security personnel occurred during a joint operation by the soldiers and the police. He confirmed the commanding officer “missing in the operation” in which the six soldiers and the Mopol were ambushed and killed. According to him, security agencies are leaving no stone unturned to rescue the missing commander unhurt.  Some security personnel in the area told The Guardian that the abduction demoralised them. Buhari had charged heads of military and other security agencies to rise up to their responsibilities and go after terrorists troubling the country and eliminate them.
