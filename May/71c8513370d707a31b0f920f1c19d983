For Nigeria to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on universal learning, there is need for the government to adopt insurance practice, Old Mutual Nigeria Managing Director, Olusegun Omosehin, has expressed. Omosehin, who spoke at the 2022 Children’s Day commemoration at the weekend, said great concern about the inaccessibility of learning by millions of children in the country, and its many daunting implications on the affected families, communities and the nation, have implications for the prospect of achieving SDGs. “We must understand that our collective future as a nation depends largely on the quality of education available to children. As the country, which UNICEF ranked the highest rate of out-of-school children in the world, coupled with a population that has rapidly increased over the last decade to an average of 10.5 million, all policymakers in the government and associated stakeholders must commit resources to strengthening the educational system. “While there have been glimpses of improvement recently, with the increase in the allocation to education in the Nigerian budget from 5.2 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, there is still a long way to go to attain the global benchmark of countries’ spending 15-20 per cent of their budgets on education,” he said.
