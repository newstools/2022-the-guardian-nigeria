Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara has appointed a six-man white paper committee on the Oyun Baptist High School, Ijagbo, Hijab crisis. This is contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr Rafiu Ajakaye, and made available to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Friday. It said Mr Amuda Kannike (SAN) is the committee Chairman while Mr Amos Thompson would serve as its Secretary. Other members of the committee are Mr Joseph Bamigboye (SAN), Dr Haruna Baba Gogata, Mrs F.O.
