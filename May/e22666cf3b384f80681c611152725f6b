The singer was included in the official list released by TIME on Thursday. In their post, TIME recognises Ckay’s efforts at “turning afrobeats into a global phenomenon—His Way.” The TIME’s Next Generation Leaders list recognises young people from across fields globally “who are working to build a better world”. “I represent the 21st century of an African experience,” he says. “If I’m going to make Afrobeats exactly the way my predecessors made it, then there’s literally no point.” Late last year, Ckay garnered over 15 billion streams on TikTok after his 2019 single Love Nwantiti went viral on the platform, capturing the ear and hearts of millions of listeners around the world. Speaking to Guardian Life, he revealed the major source of inspiration behind his music. “My music is greatly inspired by how I’m feeling at the moment. If I’ve just broken up, that is what you’re going to hear, the vibe of someone that’s dealing with heartbreak; and if I’m in an emotional place, you’re going to hear it in the music.” While Love Nwantiti continues to gather numbers on streaming platforms across the globe, Ckay has turned his efforts towards his debut album, which he intends to release this year.
