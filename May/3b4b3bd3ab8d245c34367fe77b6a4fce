The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has said that collaborative initiatives and efforts of Nigerian and other regional navies have been responsible for the considerable reduction in piracy incidents in Nigerian waters and the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). The Director-General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, said regional cooperation has played an important role in reducing incidents of piracy in GoG. According to him, the establishment of the Gulf of Guinea Maritime Collaboration Forum for the Shared Awareness and Deconfliction (GOG-MCF/SHADE) has enabled working-level stakeholders from GoG and outside the region to connect and discuss how best to tackle piracy in the area. He said this has encouraged non-regional stakeholders to step up and initiate effective maritime law enforcement operations to support the efforts. Jamoh said that “it is noteworthy that the International Maritime Bureau (IMB) has removed Nigeria from the global piracy list” owing to the recent efforts. He said while achieving this feat is tough, sustaining the status, which is the goal of the agency, will be more challenging. To this end, NIMASA and the Nigerian Navy in partnership with the Inter-Regional Coordination Centre (ICC) have concluded arrangements to host the fifth plenary of the GOG-MCF/SHADE, the DG said. The plenary, which is scheduled to take place in the Federal Capital Territory from May 10 to 11 has ‘Enduring and Sustainable Security’ as its theme with all regional navies and other stakeholders expected to attend.
