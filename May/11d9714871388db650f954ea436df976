The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant for Lagos State, Dr. Shamsideen Ade Dosunmu, has emphasised the need for restoration of good governance and socio-economic transformation of Lagos State. He said he would provide sustainable, reliable, efficient and high quality world-class infrastructural facilities that befit a mega city if elected as the next governor. Dosunmu gave the pledge at the weekend, while publicly declaring his gubernatorial ambition during a meeting with journalists, campaign co-ordinators, political associates and party leaders in Ikeja, Lagos. He said that the ‘sorry state of affairs’ in Lagos and the need and aspiration of Lagosians across various social stratifications influenced the conception of his manifesto and the 13-point agenda of Lagos restoration. He expressed optimism that his emergence as the PDP gubernatorial candidate would ensure victory for the party in 2023. The PDP chieftain, who was the party’s governorship candidate in 2011, said he was equipped with the skills needed for the seat, assuring that he was ready to offer the leadership that would rescue the state from myriad of socio-economic and political challenges facing it and usher in a new lease of life for Lagosians.
