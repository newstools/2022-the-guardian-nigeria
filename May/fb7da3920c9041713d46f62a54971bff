Her confirmation comes shortly after her alleged relationship with her 27 year-old colleague. In an interview with BBC Igbo, Eucharia, 56, expressed her apprehension about settling down. The actress’s marriage to her ex-husband, Mr Charles Edwu, came to an end in 2009 after six years of marriage, according to reports. Eucharia and Charles had an only child, Raymond, who died at the age of 15 from problems related to sickle cell anemia. In the interview, the actress turned evangelist is quoted saying, “Please, I use this opportunity and tell the world that I want to marry urgently. A great man should show himself and put a ring on this finger of mine. My specification is a man who is God-fearing and handsome. He must be up to the task, having everything that makes a man male. You must be complete, that’s all I can say.” Eucharia who was recently in the news for her alleged relationship with a 27 year-old Lucky Oparah replied to reports on social media about her alleged affair, describing it as “The height of witchcraft! How demonic and absolutely disgusting. It is well. It’s really well.” However, the actress did not refute or confirm the claims in its entirety. Eucharia Anunobi’s last know films were in the 2022 film ‘Small Chops’ and ‘Our Jesus Story’.
