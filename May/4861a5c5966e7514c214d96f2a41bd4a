Alleges assassination attempt on party’s deputy governorship candidate The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Ekiti State, Segun Oni, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Alkali Baba, to urgently halt the reprehensible activities of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, which he said, were capable of causing a crisis of an unimaginable magnitude. It also has raised the alarm over the assassination attempt on the deputy governorship candidate of the SDP, Otunba Ladi Owolabi. The call came yesterday, following a pandemonium that erupted in Ado-Ekiti when one of the campaign buses belonging to Owolabi was allegedly snatched at gunpoint by suspected thugs. The bus was said to have been driven away to an unknown destination. A statement by the Director of Media and Publicity of the campaign organisation, Mr. Jackson Adebayo, said the incident happened at the Isato Junction in Ado-Ekiti where several people sustained injuries.
MEANWHILE, the SDP said it had reported the matter to the state Police Command. This was contained in a statement by the campaign office of the SDP’s governorship candidate in Ado-Ekiti. Secretary-General of the campaign group, Dr. Dare Ojo, confirmed that an official report had been made to the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Adesina Moronkeji. However, Owolabi, while speaking with journalists, vowed never to succumb to the unwarranted intimidation by the ruling APC, which he said, had lost touch with the people and was afraid of facing the electorate on June 18, 2022. Also, Oni described the situation as an embarrassment to all Ekiti people, at home and abroad, as well as democracy lovers across the country.
