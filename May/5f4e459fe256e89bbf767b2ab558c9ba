The former agent who testified via a taped testimony described Johnny Depp as the “biggest star in the world” at one point but was fired by Depp about the same time he separated from other business acquaintances. Depp has filed a $50 million lawsuit against Heard, alleging that an op-ed she published for the Washington Post in 2018 defamed him. Depp argues that the essay, which did not name him, wrongly depicted him as an abuser. Heard has countersued Depp for $100 million, claiming that his counsel made defamatory statements about her abuse claims being a “hoax.”
