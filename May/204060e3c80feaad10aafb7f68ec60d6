Warns against attack on officials Lagos State government has arrested two people involved in an attack on officials of Vehicle Inspection Services (VIS)  along Airport Road in Oshodi area of the state.  According to him, the officials were trying to apprehend a truck driver, who violated the traffic law of the state, when a gang suddenly appeared and attacked them.
   
He explained that several dangerous weapons were used on the personnel, including; iron rods, wheel spanners and cutlasses, which could have resulted in loss of life, if not for the timely intervention of the good people of the state and the men of the state’s task force.
  
The commissioner said two of the injured VIS personnel are receiving treatment, while the apprehended truck driver and a member of the gang, will be prosecuted according to the law.  “The role of the VIS is to ensure sanity on our roads for safety of life and property and if in the cause of this onerous assignment, you feel hard done by our officials, the last thing you want to do is to resort to self help, which is against the law, endeavour to channel your grievances through the appropriate channel,” Fashola advised.
