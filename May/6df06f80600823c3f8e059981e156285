Three-man appeal panel of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, arrived in Benin City to address grievances arising from last Saturday’s congress held across 192 wards in Edo State to elect 576 delegates ahead of the party primaries. Mr. Osagie Crusoe, the media aide to the state Governor Godwin Osagie, disclosed this in statement. The state chapter of the party, according to the statement, also received members of the PDP National Assembly Appeal Screening Committee, headed by Mr. Emuobohwo Odje, and members of the state House of Assembly Appeal Screening Committee, headed by Mr. Beye Kingsley. Addressing party members at the PDP secretariat in Benin City, Chairman of the Edo PDP Ward Congresses Electoral Appeal Panel, Sen. Chukwuka Utazi, said the committee had commenced work, promising to ensure justice for all aggrieved parties. In a similar vein, Odje said: “Our job arises from what has been done before, and from the report we have seen so far, we have not received any petition, that means we have unity in the party.” Earlier, Edo PDP Chairman, Tony Aziegbemi, noted that the party was committed to ensuring that all members were united to emerge victorious in forthcoming elections.
