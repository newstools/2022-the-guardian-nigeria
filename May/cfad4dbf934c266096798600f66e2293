Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, is expected to take the official kick-off of the yearly competition, a developmental initiative of the governor, with Zenith Bank coming in to make it bigger. Preliminary matches will be played across all councils of the state between June 13 and June 17. There will be screening for all the registered players from June 20 to 24, while the zonal matches at eight designated venues across the state hold on June 27 and 28. The quarterfinals will hold on July 4, and the semifinal on July 5 at venues to be determined later by the organisers with regards to the schools that made that stage. Third place and final matches will be played at the Stephen Keshi Ultra-Modern Stadium, Asaba on July 11 and July 14 respectively. Organisers, Hidea Plus Limited, yesterday, promised to stage a successful championship. CEO of the outfit, Tony Pemu, said so much work has been done to make it a better tournament, adding that everything will be put in place for the best school to emerge winner. Group Managing Director of Zenith Bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said the outfit is committed to creating an enabling environment for the youth to flourish in their various endeavours. “We started with the Principal’s Cup and decided to come into the Headmasters’ Cup last year,” he said.
“The most important thing for us as an organisation is to develop the minds of the youths and put them on track in their various areas of sporting interest.” Valley Stream British School, Sapele, won the 2021 edition of the competition, defeating Ogbe Primary School, Effurun, 2-1 in the final.
