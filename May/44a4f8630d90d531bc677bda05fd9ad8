Worse still, losing length to thatched ends hurts. I mean, all that hair you’ve struggled to gain only to trim it off because it wouldn’t grow evenly. But what if you didn’t have to take off the ends of your hair to get rid of split ends? You’d definitely be getting longer, fuller and healthier hair. Plus, with these tips, you’ll be able to save a few stacks of would-be salon money. You know the saying: A stitch in time saves nine. Before you begin waging war against pre-existing split ends, it is important to know how they got there in the first place. We’ve done our research, and these are the most prominent causes of split ends. 1. Harsh chemicals, that is, dyes, bleaches: Most dyes and bleaches contain harsh chemicals that force the natural hair proteins into denaturalisation. Thus, the amino acids necessary for good, even hair strands become depleted. You can still get a vibrant hair colour without damaging your strands; opt for temporary, wax-based hair dyes. 2. Excessive heat: Most times, we use heat because we can’t afford to wait, especially with respect to blow-drying and curling. You may want to make a mental note to air-dry your hair instead and take the pain to use Flexi-rods for curling. However, if heat is absolutely necessary, use a heat protector on your hair first. 3. Environmental pollution: Yes, all that dust and smoke affects not just your lungs but your hair too. There’s not much you can do but try protective hairstyles. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1744120 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Olive-oil-and-egg-hair-mask.-Photo-OliveOil-838x598.jpeg" alt="" width="838" height="598" /> ● Create a DIY egg yolk hair mask: When it comes to hair health, eggs are the miracle ingredient. Eggs contain generous amounts of structural proteins necessary for thick, smooth hair. The yolk of eggs also stimulates hair growth from the scalp and reduces tangling, altogether stemming breakage and split ends caused by wear and tear. An egg mask can accommodate other ingredients, including coconut oil, sesame oil or any other beneficial oils. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1021525 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Honey-Photo.-Hillcrest-1062x548.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="548" /> ● Try a honey mask: Honey is one ingredient that can do it all. Honey is not just good for food; it works wonders on the skin and hair. The humectant properties of honey help you lock in moisture, while its antibacterial properties protect hair strands from damage. To add to the list of benefits, the high sugar content supplies additional strength to your tresses, making them less brittle and more durable. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1096740 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-281x158.jpg 281w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-562x316.jpg 562w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-531x299.jpg 531w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-487x274.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-974x548.jpg 974w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil-600x338.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FIshOil.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" /> ● Experiment with fish oil soaks: Studies have proved that omega-3 fish oils are not only good for your heart, but they are good for your hair too. So while you might buy a pack of the encapsulated fluid as an oral supplement, it is not a bad idea to use a few for your split ends. To use fish oils for your hair, mix a tablespoonful of olive oil with the contents of two or three fish oil capsules. You may add some antibacterial Chamomile to combat the slightly nauseating smell of fish oils. Dip the ends of your hair into this mixture and massage it in. Leave for about 30 minutes, then rinse off. Sulphate-Free Shampoos.

Unfortunately, alcohol-based shampoos will cause dryness. Even if you plan to deep condition your hair after shampooing, it is still better to use alcohol-free shampoos. Shampoos containing sulphates will similarly cause drying and weaken your strands. Sulphate shampoos are more likely to allow a buildup of products at your roots, encouraging flakiness and breakages. ● Use hydrating hair products: Dehydration is one of the core causes of split ends. Hydrating products like coconut oils and avocados can prevent irreversible damage to your hair proteins. Coconut oil encourages smooth, silky hair. It hydrates your hair from the scalp up so that your split ends become less evident since the smoothness masks the frays. If DIYs aren’t really your thing, you can still get your split ends treated at home by using a good leave-in-conditioner and avoiding frequent washes, even with alcohol and sulphate-free shampoos.
