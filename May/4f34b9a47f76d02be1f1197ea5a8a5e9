Following the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) validation of Jose Peseiro as Super Eagles’ manager at the weekend, former international, Friday Elahor, has described the decision as a by-product of failure of the consortium of local coaches to qualify Nigeria for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Elahor had before the World Cup play off against Ghana’s Black Stars advised the Coach Augustine Eguavoen-led Eagles’ coaching crew to ensure Nigeria qualified for Qatar 2022, adding that making the cut would compel the nation to stick to local coaches. Speaking to The Guardian yesterday, Elahor said he was not surprised that a foreigner was again named Super Eagles coach by the NFF because the local coaches failed to convince the Federation that they could do the job. “I think the NFF didn’t have other alternative than to bring in a foreign coach after what happened… NFF President, Amaju Pinnick, simply refused to listen to the voice of the people who still want another local coach to take over. “I read from the newspaper this morning that the NFF has reduced to one year the initial two and a half years deal they gave to the new coach. Whether it is true or not, I don’t know, but let’s see what he is going to do with the team. But I am still disappointed that we didn’t qualify for the World Cup,” he said. The former Eagles winger then added, “I think Emmanuel Amunike should have been considered for the job. But I think he was too much in a haste to accept to be part of the coaching crew hurriedly assembled to qualify the Eagles for the World Cup. He should have relaxed a bit by not being part of the coaching crew. May be by now he would have been considered for the job.	” “Some people actually clamoured for him to be given the job following his success in Tanzania when he qualified them for the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in 2019. But because he was part of the crew that blew our chances of World Cup qualification, that discredited him,” he stated.
