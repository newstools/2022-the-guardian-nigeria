• Says infrastructure face-lift, grants products of struggle
• End strike or we shut down airports, S’West NANS, NAUS tell FG The Ibadan Zone of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), yesterday, in Ogbomoso, said that Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomoso, remained steadfast and would not pull out of the ongoing strike declared by the national body of the academic union. The union said that LAUTECH ASUU believes in the long-term benefit of repositioning public universities and not driven by primordial sentiments being dished out in some quarters. Co-ordinator of the zone, Prof. Oyebamiji Oyegoke, who addressed a press conference, stated that the current infrastructure face-lift, which LAUTECH enjoys and TETFUND grants, which its members of staff enjoy were products of ASUU’s struggle without which the institution will not be able to have a semblance of a university. MEANWHILE, the South-West zone of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) South-West (Zone D), in conjunction with the National Association of University Students (NAUS) in South-West, yesterday, vowed to shut down airports in the country unless the protracted strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) is called off. In a statement signed by Olatunji Emmanuel Adegboye (NANS Zone D Coordinator), John Alao (NANS Zone D Deputy Co-ordinator), Opeoluwa Awoyinfa (NANS Zone D Public Relations Officer) and Adesoji Oladimeji (Vice President, NAUS South-West) and made available to The Guardian in Ibadan, the unions stressed that the intended step became imperative to put an end to the lingering strike of ASUU and ASUP, and to totally reform the education sector.
