Organisers of the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race have revealed that the 2022 edition of the race would be broadcast live by SuperSport to the global audience on Saturday. Race Director, Zack Amodu, yesterday, affirmed, “SuperSport has been our broadcast partner since the start of the race in 2013 and will broadcast the race live on television this Saturday.” Apart from fulfilling one of the key requirements of organising a World Athletics Elite Label road race, Amodu says the organisers are determined to ensure many people across the globe, especially those in the athletics family, watch the race live because it has become a global event. “SuperSport has started running the promo on Supersport Blitz as one of its exciting packages sports lovers and non-sports lovers can look forward to in the month of May. “There will also be live streaming of the race on our Facebook page. This will give many people who may not readily have access to television wherever they are all over the world the opportunity to see what is happening on the day as the race is the only one scheduled for this Saturday in the calendar of World Athletics,” added Amodu.
