A landlord at Ekwulobia Street Mile 3, Diobu in Port Harcourt City Local Council of Rivers State, on Sunday, attacked a lady, Comfort Nwagadi and her fiancée, Stanley Nwagadi, with a machete out of perceived jealousy.
   
The Guardian gathered that the landlord, identified simply as Alabo, has been taunting Comfort for dating, but was disappointed to discover that she was keeping a man whom she practically takes care of.
   
Speaking at her hospital bed, yesterday, Comfort, said a quarrel ensued on Sunday morning when she had washed and spread her clothes on the line, and Alabo, who also resides in the compound removed her clothes and threw them on the ground.  The quarrel, she said, was quelled by co-tenants and she left the compound with her fiancée.
  
She further explained that unknown to them, Alabo had sharpened a machete and was already waiting for them.
  
Comfort stressed that the moment she walked inside the compound as they came back from where they went, the landlord rushed her with a machete and inflicted several machete cuts on her.
   
She added that Stanley, who ran to save her on hearing her screams, was also cut on his head and hand before the suspect ran away.
    
MEANWHILE, her fiancée, Stanley, who was in the hospital with Comfort as a result of the cuts has called for justice on the matter.
  
Although Police Officers from Azikiwe Police Division, Ilabouchi Mile 2 Diobu have also visited the couple at the hospital, no formal statement has been released by the Rivers State Police Command at press time.
