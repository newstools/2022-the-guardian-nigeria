   Local airlines yesterday notified the Federal Government and the general public of the plan to shut down all scheduled services indefinitely effective next Monday, May 9, over unbearable cost of aviation fuel that currently sells at N700 per litre. The airlines, under the aegis of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), in a memo yesterday, regretted consequences of the “inevitable” shutdown on travellers that have already booked to travel. In a similar vein, aviation workers’ unions have also notified the government of a two-day warning strike in protest against unresolved Conditions of Service and outstanding welfare concerns, starting from Monday, May 9. President of the AON, Abdulmunaf Yunusa, in the memo endorsed by nine other airline chiefs, noted that government’s earlier intervention in the aviation fuel crisis had failed to forestall imminent shutdown, with Jet-A1 scaling the N500/litre benchmark to N700.
 
Yunusa noted that no airline could survive with the astronomical increase in aviation fuel and high cost of operations, yet continue to offer subsidised airfares to the travelling public.
 
He observed that aviation fuel price had in about 12 months risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently.  He added: “No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period. While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40 per cent of an airline’s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut Nigeria’s operating cost to about 95 per cent.

Roy Ilegbodu; his counterpart in Aero Contractors, Capt. Abdullahi Mahmood; MD of Azman Air, Faisal Abdulmunaf; CEO of Overland Airways, Capt.
