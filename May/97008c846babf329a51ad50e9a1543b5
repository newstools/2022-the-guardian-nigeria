 Funke Akindele and JJC Skillz | Pulse JJC Skillz’s ex-partner, Mella, has accused him of influencing their son Benito negatively. Mella stated this while reacting to a now-deleted video of Benito smoking on Instagram. She wrote, “The biggest problem here is that Abdul is a long time drug user who has constantly smoked dope in front of all his children, which has been a long-standing dispute between us both.” “These children look up to their father and follow his example. It’s been a big problem for me and his mother.” Mella has taken to Instagram to call out JJC and his wife Funke Akindele severally after he had called out Benito for his allegations against Funke. In a post on her Instagram page on Friday, April 15, 2022, Mella claimed that JJC assaulted his son and inflicted ‘grievous bodily harm.’ “While you parade yourself on social media pretending with fake piety to be the main character in an aspirational story, the son that you assaulted and inflicted grievous bodily harm upon is still recovering from his physical injuries and mental trauma.” “Fathers take their sons to a hospital, they don’t put them there Abdul Bello aka JJC Skillz. You can try to fake it on social media, but we will not let the truth be forgotten.” She also shared a photograph of the family, revealing the faces of their twin sons. Funke Akindele had kept the faces of her children hidden for privacy reasons. Remember that back in April, JJC’s son Benito hinted that rumours of crisis within the couple’s marriage might be true, commenting on a TikTok post of the crisis in the Bello home. In his comment, Benito claimed that after living with the actress for two years, “she’s not what you all think she is.” Adding that living with her was “horror.” JJC, in response, took to social media to show support for his wife, showering her with praises in his post.
