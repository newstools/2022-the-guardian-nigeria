New coach of the women national team, Leke Oyede, has said the team will focus on game awareness and game knowledge ahead of the Kwibuka 2022 Cricket tournament in June. Oyede said this as the team resumed camp in Benin ahead of the event in June. Team Nigeria is expected to face top sides like Brazil and Germany, among others, in the event and Oyede said focus on game awareness would help the girls soak up pressure where necessary. “One of the things we will look at is the game knowledge and awareness. It is how to give a good measure of the acts and scenes on the pitch, which will help them win games. “This will help them absolve pressure when the need arises. So, we are going to engage them with matches against the male teams here in Benin and see how to keep them with a positive mindset,” he said. The erstwhile cricketer also added that the team would also work on its fitness ahead of the tournament. A total of 18 players have been invited to camp ahead of the eight-team tournament beginning from June 9 to June 20.
