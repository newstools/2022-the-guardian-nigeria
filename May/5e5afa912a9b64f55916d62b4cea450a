The show, which was announced last year, is just one of the many projects dropped by the streaming giant in the last few weeks in a move to cut costs. Last month, Netflix announced a sharp decrease in subscribers and warned that millions more are set to quit the service wiping $50bn off its market value. Pearl was planned to centre on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. Archewell Productions, the company, formed by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced last year that Meghan would be an executive producer of Pearl. Despite the show’s cancellation, Netflix, however, confirmed that it would continue to work on several projects with Archewell Productions, including a documentary series called Heart of Invictus that will focus on athletes competing in the Invictus Games for injured veterans, an event founded by Prince Harry, in The Hague in 2022.
