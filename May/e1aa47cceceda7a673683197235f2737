The campaign’s next chapter aims to increase pressure on world leaders to commit to ending malaria at the Kigali Summit and investing funds totalling US$18 billion at the Global Fund’s Seventh Replenishment in New York this Autumn, as the world deals with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and with global health security and pandemic preparedness at the top of world leaders’ agendas. A fully replenished Global Fund is expected to enable countries and partners to reduce malaria deaths by 62%, treat 550 million malaria cases, and eliminate malaria from six more countries by 2026, as well as unlock the potential of a Zero Malaria world, assisting in the strengthening of equitable health systems and improving the lives and futures of millions of people. The second phase of Draw the Line, which is supported by the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, features inspiring cast of young people, activists, scientists, and celebrities, ranging from Malaria No More UK Leadership Council founding member David Beckham and FC Barcelona striker Pierre Emerick Aubameyang to marathon world record-holder Eliud Kipchoge and Afropop singer Yemi Alade. According to the Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, “The World Health Organization invites a new host of scientists, youth, and champions to join the malaria fight at a vital time when progress against the illness is slowing. Draw The Line gives Africa’s most compelling storytellers a platform to shift the narrative, break political lethargy, and lead the fight to stop this treatable and preventable disease that kills a child nearly every minute.” Giving her voice to support the campaign, the Zero Malaria Ambassador, Yemi Alade said, “Growing up in Nigeria I have known malaria forever and experienced the disease countless times, so I understand how this disease robs so many children of their ability to go to schools and why malaria is a major cause of school absenteeism. I believe all children should have equal opportunities to realize their full potential and that’s why I’m here because we can end one of the deadliest preventable diseases of all time.” “I love the energy and approach of this campaign harnessing the power of African inspired art, music, sport, fashion, and culture to drive positive change and build on the bold truth that we can end malaria,” Meji Alabi, Ridley Scott’s protégé and Grammy award winner, said of joining the campaign. Alabi also added, “I love the energy and approach of this campaign harnessing the power of African inspired art, music, sport, fashion, and culture to drive positive change and build on the bold truth that we can end malaria.” It can’t come fast enough I was hospitalized with malaria last year, and it was awful. No one should have to suffer from this preventable disease in this day and age.”
