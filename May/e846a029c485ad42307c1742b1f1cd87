Except in 1998, governorship elections in Delta State have always been a contest between the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and what used to be the second-largest political party, this time around, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) since 2015. And ahead of the 2023 general elections, not much has changed, but for the fact that the main action appears to be within the PDP, over who flies its ticket, as 15 aspirants have been cleared to contest for the ticket, while in the APC, it is a one-horse race of Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege.
  
The situation in the oil-rich state is tense, more so within the ruling PDP, as the supremacy battle by proxies of Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and former governor, Chief James Ibori, has gone beyond party levels.
  
The party’s Governorship Screening Committee for the South-South geopolitical zone, headed by Governor Douye Diri of Bayelsa State, last weekend, cleared 12 aspirants from the state that appeared before it in Port-Harcourt, the Rivers State capital.  Omo-Agege still unopposed in APC
WHILE the PDP battles with power rotation and a possibly crowded race in the primary election on May 21, the challenge posed by Omo-Agege, from Delta Central, being unopposed to date, is becoming real, especially with Senator Peter Nwaoboshi joining forces with him
