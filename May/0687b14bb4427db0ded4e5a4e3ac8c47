Peter Eben-Spiff and Vitus Okenwa led Dulux Paint to victory at the just-concluded national finals of the World Corporate Golf Challenge (WCGC) held at the Lakowe Lakes Golf and Country Estate, Lagos. The duo grossed a total of 45 stable-ford points to win the competition by one point ahead of hard-fighting Eko Support 1, represented by Okey Ananaba and Remi Edu at 44 points. The pair of Mohammed Suleiman and Jumai Abdulahi, representing NCDMB-3 from IBB International Golf and Country Club, Abuja, came third with a score of 41 stable-ford points, beating Chidi Momah and Julius Fadairo, who represented Julius Fadairo and Co., on countback. Completing the top five winners in the keenly contested encounter is the team of Oregon and Omars represented by Abiye Amakri and Peter Omoruaye. Though the players were originally expected to be scored over 36-holes, the weather disrupted the opening round, thereby forcing the organisers to score participants over the closing 18-holes. Satisfied with the outcome of the competition, Chief Executive Officer of Falcon Golf Development Company, Remi Olukoya, expressed appreciation to the players and attendees, saying he will continue to work to improve on the quality of the tournament.     
“Falcon Golf Development Company will like to express our appreciation to NCDMB for their support over the years. We also express our gratitude towards Pepsi, Guinness, Banwo & Ighodalo, Henley & Partners, First E&P, OVH Energy, PwC, Geregu Power, Dulux Paints, Dradrock Real Estate, Mixta Africa, Mainstream Power, Lagoon Hospital, Rwanda Airlines, Singleton, 2sure, Dubic Malt, Captain Morgan, DO Bowls and Kia Motors for the success of this event,” he said. For winning the competition, Team Dulux will be sponsored to the World finals of WCGC at the Island of Tenerife, Spain in October 17 to 21, 2022.
