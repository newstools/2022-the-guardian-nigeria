Dr. Mike Onolememen, a former Minister for Works, says his ambition to vie for election into the Edo Central Senatorial District is the desire to transform Esanland from a largely rural to an urban area. Onolememen disclosed this on Sunday in his message to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegates for the Senatorial District ahead of the May 21 primaries of the party. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the erstwhile minister also served as Minister of State for Defence, under ex-President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. The renowned architect, in the message, urged the delegates to help him secure the ticket, with a pledge to turn things around for the area. Onolememen, who is one of the strong aspirants seeking to clinch the party’s ticket on Saturday, declared his intention in March. “I am personally soliciting for your votes in the upcoming primary that will take place on Saturday May 21, 2022. “I am banking on you to win the primary election. There is so much at stake. And we must get it right for Esan people. “Engage and talk to other delegates you know to vote for me,” pleaded the senatorial aspirant. “Much is at stake for the senatorial constituency, hence the party would have to get it right for Esan Land,” he said. He added that he could win the primary election with votes from the delegates and go on to win the general election. “Please, it is an important election that has the potential to transform Esan Land from rural enclave to urban area with enhanced standards of living. “Since an election can be won by a single vote, your vote matters. “I assure you, you will not regret supporting me and your vote will be a step forward to making Esan Land a better place,” he said.
