The Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) has called for the full operationalisation of the Domestic Export Warehouse initiative (DEW) initiated by the Nigeria Shippers Council (NSC) to ease logistics constraints at the ports. The NIPC Director General, Emeka Offor, during an interactive meeting with the NSC, yesterday, in Abuja maintained that the DEW project being implemented by NSC alongside other sister organisations would go a long way in addressing logistics issues in the non-oil sector given the gridlock at the ports. Mentioning that the DEW project is key to its operations, he said the agency is ready to collaborate with NSC to ensure full implementation of the initiative. Meanwhile, the two agencies have expressed readiness to collaborate in addressing challenges facing the export of non-oil products in the country. The Executive Secretary of NSC, Emmanuel Jime, stated that one of the challenges of non-oil export in the country was the non-compliance of trade rules by exporters and importers. “Non-oil compliance to trade rules is actually a problem of exporters and importers. To address this challenge, the Council will like to collaborate with the NEPC to organise more enlightenment programmes so that exporters and importers can imbibe integrity in international trade,” he said.
