Former Captain, wicket-keeper and batsman, Ademola Onikoyi and Chimezie Onwuzurike are among the top players expected to start training ahead of the country’s upcoming international engagements later in the year. The list released by Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), at the weekend, contains players, who excelled at the Tafawa Balewa Square oval trial early in the year. Also on the list are current captain, Sylvester Okpe, World T20 record holder, Peter Aho and last year’s Tri-Series best player, Sesan Adedeji. Other top players named in the provisional list include teenage sensation, Prosper Useni, the Isesele brothers (Odion and Akhere), Elochukwu Ndububem, Boniface Oche, Chiemelie Udekwe, Taiwo Mohammed, Ifeanyi Uboh, Mustapha Yusuf, Joseph Asia and Ridwan Abdulkareem. Ashmit Shreshta and Suleiman Runsewe are Wicket Keepers picked for the camp, while Samuel Mba and Pradeep Chaudhary complete the top order batsmen. Vincent Adewoye, Kodjo Timinade and Eghosa Aghedo are other names in the middle order batting lines along with pace bowler, Mustapha Yusuf. Also in the list, but on standby, are Abolarin Rasheed, Nzube Nwokike and Daniel Ajekun. NCF General Manager, Emeka Igwilo, who signed the list, said he believes the players are set to prove themselves ahead of the engagement they are billed for. “The Federation will be looking out for these players to take up the challenge to represent the country. They have individually proven themselves and we hope they will be able to work together,” Igwilo said.
