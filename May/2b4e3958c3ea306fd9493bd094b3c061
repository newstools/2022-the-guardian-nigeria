This time, it was a mix of events, some of which we cheered and some left us stunned. Catch up on the trendy stories that made the previous week: Yul Edochie It has been a dramatic ride since Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, revealed his son and second wife, fellow Nollywood actress, Judy Austin Moghalu, to the public. Before now, Yul had praised his wife, May Edochie, for being his bedrock and standing by him. However, since his announcement, the marriage, it appears, might be heading for the rocks. On the other hand, Judy has said that she might be ready to tell her side of the story.
“There’s this saying that there is no smoke without fire, and it takes two to tango, but most times in Nigeria, we don’t have that kind of patience to hear…” she said. Burna Boy | Image: Getty Images Special announcement! Remember when Burna Boy claimed the throne as the African Giant and trolls came for him? Well, hello…. Haters.
One-time Guardian Life cover personality, Burna Boy has become the first Nigerian to sell out the Madison Square Garden. With this, he joins Michael Jackson, Justin Bieber, Michael Jackson, Adele, Rihanna, Billy Joel, and Jay Z to sell out the infamous Madison. Performing songs from his discography, teasing us with a new release and going on with no features, Burna Boy is a worthy example of “speak it till you do it!” It’s A1 from here. Johnny Depp and Amber Heard – Leportale It appears that we might be seeing a glimpse of Depp’s admittance about his life being ruined whether or not he wins the court case. A talent agent has now claimed that Depp lost a $22.5million deal for the sixth Pirates of the Caribbean film shortly after Heard’s 2018 op-ed. Recall that Depp’s talent agent Jack Whigham said,
“After the op-ed, it was impossible to get him a studio film, which is what we normally would have been focused on in that time period.” Meanwhile, Heard’s attorney argued that there was no written proof or contract stating he would return for a sixth Pirates film. Meghan Markle’s animated series has been reportedly cancelled by Netflix. The show, which was announced last year, is just one of the many projects dropped by the streaming giant in the last few weeks in a move to cut costs.
Pearl was planned to centre on the adventures of a 12-year-old girl inspired by influential women from history. Despite the show’s cancellation, Netflix, however, confirmed that it would continue to work on several projects with Archewell Productions, including a documentary series called Heart of Invictus that will focus on athletes competing in the Invictus Games for injured veterans, an event founded by Prince Harry.
