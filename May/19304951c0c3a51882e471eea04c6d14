Determined to actualise the Federal Government’s autogas policy, NIPCO Gas Limited, (a subsidiary of NIPCO Plc) and Femadec Express have entered into a partnership to increase the usage of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) to power vehicles in Nigeria.  “In the near term, cities such as Lekki–Epe Expressway (Lagos), Ibadan, Oron etc will have similar facilities. Within the year, NIPCO Gas plans to convert additional vehicles in several locations and as well expand its CNG retail stations across Nigeria with an additional 45 stations. The phase one of the projects has led to the inauguration of 14 stations already,” he stated.
 
With abundant gas resources of over 200 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), he said there was a need for Nigeria to optimally utilise the resources by converting vehicles to run on gas.
 
According to him, autogas is applicable to airports – terminal buses, shuttle buses; taxis, short delivery pick-up vans, private vehicles, a large fleet of commercial vehicles, school buses, transit buses, trucks, and other long haulage vehicles, among others.
