The 8th edition of the Africa Magic Viewers Choice Awards had us glued to our phones, mostly to see what outfits our favourite celebrities wore. Based on the stunning looks that descended on the red carpet, it is safe to say that nearly all the attendees understood the style assignment and delivered on show-stopping trends, gag-worthy accessories, flawless beauty looks, and chic poses. From bold and artistic masterpieces to elegant and regal designs, this year was quite different as many male celebrities stepped up their fashion game by ditching the cliche black tuxedo and opting for floral prints or tuxedos with more details. Erica Nlewedim Someone needs to send this lady a met gala invitation right away because she absolutely slayed it in this stunning butterfly-inspired gown. The colour of the gown complimented her skin tone and gave the overall design a liquid feel and look. Denola Grey Do we need to say anything else? There’s a reason he won best dressed at the event, and it’s not because of his cheekbones or awesome poses. Denola stole the show in a burgundy velvet beaded tuxedo by Mai Atafo. Osas Ighodaro Winning best actress at the AMVCA 2022 isn’t the only thing Osas will be remembered for, but the gown that earned her an award. The train alone drew our attention, but there was also the jaw-dropping fit and sheerness of the bodice. Bisola Aiyeola Category is yellow for days. Bisola debunked the unpopular myth, “colour yellow isn’t for everyone” as she looked stunning in this Somo gown with tulle shoulders. Toke Makinwa A petition should be made against Toke Makinwa being the centre of attention at awards shows. The talented actress’s outfit is what one can only describe as what happens when royalty meets sexy. Bonang Matheba In a rose pink gown with sheer-feather lined dramatic sleeves, this media personality represented South Africa loud and proud. Leo Dasilva Something about Leo’s style makes you want to assemble a team of experts and plan a heist to break into his wardrobe. This floral print suit is a breath of fresh air, keeping it simple but very classy. Now let’s get shady. Before continuing, please keep in mind that the author’s viewpoint is solely his or her own and does not represent Guardian Life. There is always a worst where there is a best, and the AMVCA was no exception. While some celebrities made us scream, others made us reconsider wearing clothes or watching the AMVCA.  Toyin Lawani: There is a great difference between a costume party and an award ceremony. Toyin was oblivious to this as she arrived in what can only be described as the gown from hell. Not only did it have a bull’s horn, but it also failed to highlight her amazing figure.  Pretty Mike: This is not surprising given his reputation for wearing disastrous outfits to every red carpet. At the very least, he spiced things up this time by carrying a kid goat and replicating Alicia Keys’ Met Gala outfit, complete with what can only be described as a lamp head. Oyebade Bimbe Adedimeji : When I saw this gown, I couldn’t help but cry tears of disgust. Where do I even start? Everything was terrible, from the hideous fit to the fact that papers shaped like flowers were attached to the gown. James Brown: All hail James of Brownstown. Not to throw shade, but everything about this outfit is hilarious. Though there was a valid regency concept, the execution was plain messy. Cute Abiola: This comedian reminded us of the importance of always choosing the right fabric. Don’t get me wrong: the agbada with beautiful embroidery was lovely, but it didn’t appear to have met the face of an iron. Ebuka: E shock you too! The monochrome blue tuxedo he wore was a big disappointment to his title as the king of fashion. But since this is his first fashion faux pas, everything is forgiven.  Simi Drey: Her outfit literally left me speechless, and not in a good way.  Simi made a wrong choice when she made the life changing decision to attend the AMVCA as a low budget Kim Kardsahian at the Met Gala 2021. Nothing screamed fas, talkless of hion. In fact, horrible is not enough to describe how the outfit looked.
