Analysts predicted the return of the bears through profit-taking in the near future, given the five consecutive weeks of bullish run in the market. Chief Research Officer of Investdata Consulting, Ambrose Omordion said: “We note that investors are continuing their search for commodity-backed stocks with good fundamentals and positive returns above the inflation rate. On this note, we expect the fixed income market players to hedge against the spiralling inflation in stocks with high earnings yields. “However, we warn that market corrections are underway as a result of profit-taking, hence the need to rely on your stop-loss effectively at this point. “This is even as the markup phase signals continuation, especially when the high cap stocks that control 70 per cent of market capitalisation move up ahead of reactions to their earnings and expected dividend payments in May and June 2022.” Cordros Capital said: “In the near term, we think the bears are likely to book profit across most counters given the five-week bullish run in the market. “Thus, we see more of a ‘choppy theme’ as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the MPC meeting scheduled later in the month. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Further breakdown of last week’s trading showed that a total of 175,506 units of Exchange Traded Products valued at N6.8 million were traded last week in 36 deals compared with a total of 147,708 units valued at N3 million transacted in 19 deals during the preceding week.
