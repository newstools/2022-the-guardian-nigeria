Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has warned candidates in the just-concluded 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to be wary of fraudsters, claiming scoring errors. The board reiterated that the examination was a computer-based test devoid of human influences. JAMB’s Head, Public Affairs and Protocol, Fabian Benjamin, said the “unfounded rumours making the rounds are nothing but the product of the deceitful brains of the masterminds of the baseless imputations.” He added: “Hence, the board reiterates that there is no room for errors in its electronic scoring system nor does it plan to organise another UTME. “This clarification became necessary following reports of a purported rescheduling of the UTME from a section of the social media, citing phantom errors in the computer scoring system and a purported apology from JAMB to the effect that another UTME would be organised.” According to him the “board wishes to state that the report is not only false, mischievous, but also misleading and crafted out of the frustration and inability of these fraudsters to dupe unsuspecting candidates owing to the series of innovative strategies the board had put in place to protect candidates.” He added: “The public would recall that the board had envisaged some of these inglorious strategies of these nefarious individuals and had sounded a note of warning to the candidates and the public alike so as to preclude the possibilities of them falling victims of the evil machinations of fraudsters. “JAMB, once again, advises the public to disregard this items of news as it does not emanate from JAMB nor has it authorised any individual or group to make such a pronouncement on its behalf. “The board, therefore, advises candidates to avail themselves of its user-friendly advisories on assessing their 2022 UTME results and other processes through periodic visits to www.jamb.gov.ng.”
