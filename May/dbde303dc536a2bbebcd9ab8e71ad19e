Over 250 participants are expected to feature in the fourth Templars and Patrelli Secondary School Cricket Competition in Benin. Templars and Patrelli are both law firms located in Lagos, but they will individually organise the boy’s and girls’ categories of the event respectively. The Templars tournament will feature 11 secondary schools in the men’s event, while the Patrelli competition, which is focused on promoting and providing equal participation and opportunities for girls in sport, will involve eight schools. The tournament is scheduled for the Edo Boys High School, Adolor, which boasts a turf wicket. It is the first time the event will be played on such ground. Over the years, the league has grown to accommodate more schools and harvest a number of talents, who have grown to become part of the state and national teams. World record holder, Peter Aho, is a product of the tournament, just like some other star players in the national team, including Abigail Igbobie, Lucky Piety, Prosper Useni, Favour Eseigbe and Akhere Isesele. Others are Odion Isesele, David Abiebhode, Asia Joshua, Selim Salau and Reigneth Osagie, among others, who are members of the Edo State U-17 squad. This programme schools competition is a key aspect of the Templars and Patrelli corporate sustainability and responsibility strategy, which focuses on youth empowerment through sports, as well as supports the youth development initiative of the Edo state government.
