A constitutional lawyer and human rights activist, Festus Ogun, has sued President Muhammadu Buhari at the Federal High Court, Lagos, praying the court to declare his self-appointment as minister of petroleum unlawful.
  
Joined in the suit are the Attorney-General of the Federation and National Assembly as second and third defendants, respectively. The applicant urged the court to so declare because his role as the President and Minister, at the same time, allegedly violates the provisions of Sections 138 and 147(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as altered).
  
The applicant is praying the court to declare that the 1st defendant’s appointment and continue serving as Minister of Petroleum Resources is a gross violation of Sections 138 and 147(2) of the Constitution, and therefore, unconstitutional, wrongful, undemocratic, invalid, ultra vires and null and void.
  
He also prayed the court for an order restraining the 1st defendant from serving or parading himself as the Minister of Petroleum Resources.
