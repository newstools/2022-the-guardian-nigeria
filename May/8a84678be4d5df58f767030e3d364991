While staying in bed with your blanket tightly wound around you may sound like a great idea, an even better idea is cuddling your partner under those warm or heated blankets. Even more exciting is realising that cuddling does wonders for your love life and health. Need some more reasons to cuddle? These benefits of cuddling should give you all the reasons to cuddle everytime it rains. Nothing helps you destress better than feeling your partner’s arms wrapped around you as the rhythmic beating of their heart serenades you to sleep. Lower stress levels equal better sleep. That’s not all; cuddling improves your serotonin levels, which means you feel good about yourself, improving your outlook on life and everything else. Ever gotten a tight hug when you’re wound up? If you have, you already know that it does wonders in calming you down. Every time you get wound up and angry, your heart rate shoots up, and cuddling could lower it down to optimal levels. When you’re in close body contact with your partner, you unconsciously pick on their body rhythm. Cuddling syncs your breathing with theirs, helping you calm down when you’re anxious or hyperventilating. Touch therapy is often recommended for mental and emotional discomfort. Cuddling releases Oxytocin, a hormone with strong pain-reducing potential. Getting cuddled when you experience pain releases Oxytocin, easing out the pain you feel, making you feel needed and reminding you that someone is there for you. Improve your sex life by cuddling your partner regularly. Snuggling into their arms and touching them improves your bond, restoring the spark you both share and improving your intimacy. Feeling calm and being happy when you do your favourite things doesn’t equate to the happiness you feel every time you get cuddles. That’s really because cuddling releases Oxytocin, the ‘love hormone.’ Our Final Word Little things like cuddling make a lot of difference not just in your individual life but also in your relationship. Touch remains an integral part of the human experience, and cuddling is a great way to experience the wonders of touch.
