This news comes at the peak of Depp’s defamation suit against ex Amber Heard. Confirming Depp’s removal from the franchise, producer Jerry Bruckheimer affirmed that Depp would not be included in the scripts for the new addition to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Speaking to The Sunday Times, Bruckheimer revealed that they are working on two scripts, one that features actress Margot Robbie and one that doesn’t. Depp is currently engaged in a televised court case against ex-wife Amber Heard, who accused him of physically assaulting her. Heard’s claims of domestic violence had caused Depp to be blacklisted in Hollywood, costing him his role as Captain Jack Sparrow and a feature in potential roles, including the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Margot Robbie’s role in the new Pirates of the Caribbean film remains unconfirmed, but many speculate that she may play Jack Sparrow.
