Unlike work and daily makeup, there’s a certain panache and flair added to makeup for formal and evening events. This is not the time to opt for a simple foundation and winged liner look, except you plan to go overboard with your eye makeup. If hiring a makeup artist for your next formal outing is off your list, you can always DIY it. Need some help? Try these five gorgeous makeup looks for your next A-list event. The trick is to let your eyes do all the talking at every formal event. No A-list event is complete without the classic smokey eyes. Not only are they classy and elegant, but they also add the much-needed touch of sexy, completing your overall look. If black smokey eyes aren’t your thing, nothing stops you from trying a brown one or experimenting with colours. Create this timeless red-carpet-worthy look by first priming your eyes. Next, apply some eyeshadow to your lids, building up the smokey effect. Finish with some winged eyeliner to add some definition to your eyes and a setting spray to keep it all in place. You’re all set to be the star of the show. Red lips are red-carpet worthy and always top the list. Adding some pop to your makeup keeps all attention on your face and eyes on your lips, making sure everyone can hear the words coming out of your mouth. To create this look, you’ll need your trusty lip liner in the same shade or a slightly close one to outline your lips before applying your lipstick. Your lip colour choices don’t always have to be red; some orange and light pinked shades would fit just right. Seal the deal with some gloss and smack your way into elegance. Face jewels are in and here to stay. If you prefer more muted looks, try applying some rhinestone clearly around your eyes to finish up the look. Add some rhinestones around your eyelids, the corners of your eyes, or just on either lash line. Use some lash glue to hold these jewels in place, and you’re ready to go. To pull off glittered eyes, start by setting your base with a primer to keep your eye makeup in place. You can apply your glitter eyeshadow with your fingers or a brush for more precision. Soft dewy makeup looks have also found their way onto formal makeup looks. If you plan to keep all eyes on your outfit or you would rather wear next to no makeup at all, this is the look for you. The trick is to create a natural-looking glass-like effect. You need a solid base, the right face primer, concealer, highlighter and powder to pull this off. Some events require subtlety and maybe even naked skin, while others call for multiple layers of foundation and all the glitter you can find. However, these are just two ends of a very long spectrum of makeup looks to rock. Often, you’d find that nude makeup is too drab, but you’d look like you tried too much if you wore a full makeup look. To fix this, all you have to do is adjust your makeup skills to a wider range of events!
