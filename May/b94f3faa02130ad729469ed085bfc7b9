Former Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, on Tuesday, asked the leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to suspend the election of the national delegates for Enugu State billed for Tuesday, May 10. Ekweremadu, who is a governorship aspirant of the party in Enugu State in the 2023 elections, said the suspension was necessary to allow the court to adjudicate the contentions over the list of three-mam delegates now before it. He said it would amount to the disrespect of the court process on the matter and the primary election of the party should it go on with the process, alleging that some of the delegates that would participate in the process were not elected. In a statement he issued in Enugu through the Director-General of his Ikeoha Campaign organization, Ogbo Asogwa, he said: “It has come to the knowledge of the Ikeoha Campaign Organisation that some interest groups are planning to use the concocted list of three-man delegates that is being challenged in court in the election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Delegates in Enugu today, the 10th day of May 2022. “Recall that we all know that those on that list never participated in the election of three-man delegates in Enugu State and where they participated, they lost. “The Ikeoha Campaign Organisation, therefore, advises the PDP to refrain from impunity and allow the courts to adjudicate on the matter. Any such disrespect to the court process on the matter will have consequences on our primary elections. “In the circumstance, therefore, we urge the PDP to suspend the exercise of electing National Delegates in Enugu State today and await the court verdict regarding the three-man delegates. “We equally hereby advise all lovers of democracy and all those who have respect for our judiciary to shun today’s exercise”.
