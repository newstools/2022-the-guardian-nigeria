Again, former speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, Kabiru Alhassan Rurum, has dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Rurum, who is presently representing Rano/Bunkure/Kibiya federal constituency of Kano State, confirmed his decision to The Guardian on telephone Sunday but did not disclosed which of the political party he would join. According to him, “I am confirming to you that I’m no longer a member of APC in Kano and that is exactly what I will tell you for now. I will keep you inform of my next political move very soon”. Although, Rurum who had also joined the gubernatorial race to succeed Ganduje did not disclosed reason behind his decision, a reliable source hinted that the sudden action was as a result of the APC stakeholders meeting held yesterday at government house. According to the source, Rurum decided to quit APC following Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje’s alleged endorsement of deputy Governor Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna as governorship candidate and immediate past commissioner for local government, Murtala Sule Garo as deputy. Rurum, who had claimed that Kano south has been neglected and never produced substantive governor since the returned of democracy in 1999, vowed to change the narrative as the only candidate from the south. His action is coming less than 24 hours former member of the house and director general of Bola Tinubu’s presidential campaign, Abdulmumin Jibrin also dumped the party. Effort to speak to Kano state Commissioner for information Muhammad Garba on the development was not successful.
