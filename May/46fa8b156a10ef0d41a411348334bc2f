Ibeju Lekki, at the weekend, became champions of the 2021/2022 Club Cricket Committee (CCC) League, which will be finally wrapped up on May 22 at the Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval, Lagos. After 15 games from a league that started last November, Ibeju is unbeaten, winning 12 matches and sharing three match points on account of bad playing conditions, mostly occasioned by inclement weather. The win means that the Islanders, who were also 2019/20 winners before the 2020/21 season was ruled out because of COVID-19, would be formally decorated on the last day of the league. Speaking on the league, CCC Chairman, Akin Denton, described the season as one of the most challenging, adding that the clubs have been most cooperative since the league got underway last year. “We are glad we are winding up now and I must say the teams have shown a pure passion for the game. “The launch of the TBS Oval was a major milestone and it got us playing on two facilities, including the University of Lagos’ pitch, where the season started on,” he said. He said the clubs showed understanding and respected the official decisions, which was a hallmark of professionalism on the side of their owners and boards. Denton praised the consistency and the discipline of the Ibeju Lekki side and congratulated all the teams that saw the season through. “Apart from Ibeju that has had a spectacular season, I want to also congratulate Ibadan Metropolitan Cricket Club and Island Titans, who have both been promoted from Division 2 to play in Division 1 next season,” he added. This year’s league is sponsored by Gbolahan Olusegun Yishawu, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly.
