Chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Chief A.C. Okocha, has lauded the National Chairman of the party, Iyorchia Ayu, for identifying Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the pride of the PDP. Okocha, who is also the leader of the PDP Elders Forum in Delta State, stated that such words of appreciation  coming from Ayu could count for so much since Ayu is not known for frivolous talks. “We in Delta know what Okowa stands for. The governor is a great performer and this is the reason he could put on ground those great infrastructure that bewildered Ayu. I mean, Okowa is usually at work without making noise. This is what Ayu saw on ground and he couldn’t help but make those sound comments,” he said. Okocha also stated that it was note worthy for Ayu to have mentioned that while big wigs in the PDP were hauling abuse at each other over touchy issue of who becomes President, Okowa maintained his cool and kept on preaching oneness in the party. “Without gainsaying, Okowa is much more qualified than those picking tickets to become President. But you can imagine the manner he kept his cool while serving the party in the bigger area of maintaining peace and unity in the party. I am happy everyone is realising this fact. And it shows in how aspirants fall on each another to get his blessings the minute they pick nomination forms.”
