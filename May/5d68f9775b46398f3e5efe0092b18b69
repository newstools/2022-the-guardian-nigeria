Three Nigerian junior stars, Ohunene Yakubu, Khadijat Mohammed and Ndidi Osaji, have qualified for the U-14 category of the Morocco 2022 World Junior Tennis Championship. The three youngsters earned the rights to represent Nigeria at the recent West and Central Africa regional qualifiers of the championships held in Lome, Togo. Speaking on the qualifying championship in Togo, National Junior Tennis Coach, Ubale Mohammed, said the three girls have had encouraging results in the various competitions they participated in all season. Ohunene was one of the youngsters at the Rainoil Tennis Open Championships held in Lagos last year. She was also the most outstanding player at the Sapetro competition, where Nigeria’s Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare, was in attendance. Khadijat is Nigeria’s undisputed U-14 champion, winning every tournament with sheer finesse and class and earning many accolades in the process. At the Azimuth Shipping Lines Junior Tennis Championship held in Lagos, Khadijat scooped the title in two age categories. The youngest of the trio, Ndidi, is also arguably the best in her category after her recent triumphs, the latest being her performance at the Azimuth and Sapetro competitions. Ubale noted that based on what he has seen of the girls’ performances, they will excel in Morocco. “You know it’s a team competition; so, we always have to travel with the squad. By the grace of God, we should be traveling with the same players that got us there and I believe that we will make the country proud,” he said.
