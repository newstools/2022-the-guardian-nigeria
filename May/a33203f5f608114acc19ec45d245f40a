Nosa Okunbo, son of late Nigerian business magnate, Hosa ‘Wells’ Okunbo, is undoubtedly one of the brightest college basketball players in the United States. However, as glaring as his talent and capabilities are as a prospective NBA player, the debate about his qualities has been raging. Endowed with a towering height of 6ft 7inch, the 19-year-old is already prepared for greatness in the sport. The Edo-born forward, however, is already achieving greatness off the court, having bagged the 2022 Euroknowledge Youth Advocacy award as the youngest recipient of the prestigious award for his impact among youths. The teenager also received the International Burj CEO awards for his outreaches through his Africa to the World (ATTW) non-profit organization he founded not long ago. But Okunbo has vowed that he would not let the media hype get to him. “A lot of people say I am underrated, while others say I’m overrated. I try not to look too much into media hype and criticism and stay more level headed,” Okunbo stated. On how he started playing basketball, he disclosed that a trainer in the US encouraged him to pursue the sport on a professional level after he had ditched football. “I started playing basketball competitively at 15-years-old and it all started with me goofing around at a random gym in Houston, and an AAU coach urged me to start taking it seriously,” Okunbo disclosed. “It was a big decision I had to make; to quit football after already being an established football player back home and to move across the world and start a completely new sport.”
