Experts and stakeholders in Nigeria’s payment industry have called for concerted efforts to mitigate the growing menace of digital frauds.  Uaboi further explained that Visa is working with the Nigerian government, Central bank and other partners to build a framework for which contactless will come in and thrive in Nigeria.
  
In a separate remark, the Managing Director of Interswitch, Hakeem Lawal, said that while support from overseas is important for payment penetration in Africa, the development of Africa’s payment system is largely in the hands of Africans via participation, policies and tailor-made solutions to address the needs. He said it was evident in the penetration of Mobile Money in Sub-Saharan Africa and the wide spread of online real-time funds transfer in Nigeria.
