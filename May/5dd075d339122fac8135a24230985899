Leofied has announced the launching of the freelance platform in Africa to strengthen commerce and the workforce across Africa. Leofied is an online community that connects consumers and businesses to freelance service professionals. With a target of $20 billion in freelance commerce over the next couple of years, Leofied plans to disrupt and improve the industry in Nigeria and across Africa. The platform provides a route for financial freedom for Nigerians and Africans, allowing them to make money without limits from the comfort of their homes. With the looming market, Leofied connects the best freelancers across the continent to a global audience, monetizing skills and servicing organisations. The CEO of Leofied, Jonathan Frank Omonigho, said: “There are a couple of freelance platforms in Africa but most have failed to cater for the needs of African freelancers in Africa. We could see how our workforce struggled during the pandemic. With Leofied, we seek to bridge this gap, improve on the lapses and provide a platform for this fast springing workforce to thrive on.” One of the major challenges Leofied seeks to improve on is that of payments. Leofied provides a variety of channels through which freelancers get paid both locally and internationally. These channels include, Cryptocurrency, international bank transfers, in-app wallets and lots more.
