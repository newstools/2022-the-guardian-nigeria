Leeds United and Burnley are reportedly threatening legal action against the Premier League and Everton because they believe the Toffees have seriously breached financial rules. According to The Times, they both wrote to the Premier League last week asking what action, if any, is being taken with Everton recording losses totalling £371.8m over three years. Sportsmail first reported in April that clubs could launch legal action against Everton. Leeds and Burnley are battling to retain their place in the Premier League, while club of Super Eagles striker, Alex Iwobi, Everton, secured their top-flight place with Thursday’s dramatic 3-2 fightback against Crystal Palace at Goodison Park. Premier League rules state clubs can post a maximum loss of £105m over three years and could have a points sanction if they breach that figure,
Clubs can write off losses caused by the Covid-19 pandemic but according to The Times, they have expressed concerns that Everton’s losses are over three-times that of a club that is a similar size. In March, Everton said in a statement that £170m of their losses ‘are attributed to the impact on the club of the Covid-19 pandemic.’ The Times quoted an Everton spokesperson as saying: ‘We have worked so closely with the Premier League to make sure we are compliant we are comfortable we have complied with the rules. ‘External auditors have told us what we can and cannot claim against the pandemic. If they want to take legal action then they can do so by all means.’ Leeds are 18th in the standings going into the final round of this week’s fixtures on 35 points, the same as Burnley but the Clarets have a less inferior goal difference. Leeds are away to Brentford on Sunday, while Burnley host Newcastle.
