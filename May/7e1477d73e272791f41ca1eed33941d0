• Mauritius join Nigeria in AFCON qualifying series’ Group A Group B winners, Nigeria, will today confront the second–placed team in Group A, Cote d’Ivoire, in the second semifinal of the ongoing WAFU B U20 Championship in Niamey, Niger Republic.  Mauritius had filed a protest against São Tomé and Príncipe, who won their preliminary qualifying fixture, insisting that one São Tomé player had tested positive for COVID-19. “The matter became somewhat more interesting because the player at the centre of the controversy is the one that scored the only goal of the match,” said our source at the time.
