The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs has organised skill acquisition training for women in Plateau State to boost their economic contributions to the nation. The facilitator, Mrs. Lydia Shehu, said, yesterday, that the training on how to make liquid soap, disinfectant, hand sanitiser and others was organised in partnership with Joseph Afe and Partners. She explained that the training was aimed at empowering women economically through the production of sanitary items for the management of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) hazards. “This training is put together by the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Paulen Tallen, to empower women with the necessary skills that would improve their health and economic status. It will also improve access to Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) practices in families and communities in general,” she said.
