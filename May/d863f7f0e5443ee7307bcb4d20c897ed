The Guardians of the Galaxy actor and his author wife on Sunday night announced the birth of their baby in separate posts on their respective Instagram accounts. The caption read, “We are so excited to announce the birth of our second daughter, Eloise Christina Schwarzenegger Pratt.” “We feel beyond blessed and grateful. Love, Katherine and Chris.” The couple got married in 2019 and are parents to daughter Lyla Schwarzenegger Pratt. Schwarzenegger, the daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, speaking to British model and fellow new mother Iskra Lawrence on a Mother’s Day edition of her Instagram video series “BDA (Before, During, & After) Baby” last year discussed how she navigated through the challenges and rewards of parenthood with the help of Pratt. “My husband has always been super-supportive and also very vocal,” she said. “He’ll look at our daughter (Lyla) and be like, ‘Can you believe you’re able to feed, your body is able to feed your baby?'” The couple maintains a relatively private life and do not share many glimpses of their family. Schwarzenegger previously revealed that her pubic upbringing was responsible for the decision to keep their family private.
