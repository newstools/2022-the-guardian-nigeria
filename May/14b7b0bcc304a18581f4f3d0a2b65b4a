Sen. Aliyu Wamakko on Saturday secured the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket to contest election into the Sokoto Central senatorial district for the third term. Wamakko secured the mandate through affirmation votes by delegates from eight local government areas of the district at the primary election. The motion for affirmation was moved by Babangida Dantsoho from Sokoto South Local Government Area and seconded by Aliyu Sabo from Kware Local Government Area. The exercise was conducted by election committee members, including Mr Wale Ojo and Dr Tona Famadewa, secretary and member, respectively. Also present were the Mrs Hauwa Kangiwa-led supervisors from INEC and various security agencies. In his remarks after the affirmation, Wamakko thanked the delegates for their support. He gave the assurance to continue with active representation and the uplifting peoples’ standard of living through empowerment while also supporting government to overcome its challenges. He noted that time would soon come when he would go aside and allow youths to participate in politics to be able to contribute their quota. Wamakko, who is the chairman Senate Committee on Defence, said time would soon come for his generation to step aside and give youths the opportunity to participate in politics. He also thanked his supporters and enjoined them to live in peace while engaging in viable programmes that would contribute to the nation’s growth.
