Persons older than 65 years of age have been barred from participating in the 2022 Hajj pilgrimage, according to a guideline released by Saudi authorities. The guideline also emphasized strict adherence to covid-19 protocols and health insurance for pilgrims preparing for this year’s Hajj. The spokesperson of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), Fatima Usara, said the Saudi health ministry mandated the compulsory use of face masks whether indoors or outdoors in Saudi Arabia during the Hajj period. Apart from exempting persons over 65 years from performing the Hajj, high-risk pilgrims, categorized as those with severe ailments such as active cancer or organ impairment, will also be restricted from participating in the exercise. “The guideline equally mandates the completion of basic immunization programs before arrival into the Kingdom,” Usara said. “These immunizations cover Covid-19 vaccination, yellow fever inoculation, and meningococcal meningitis vaccination, received not less than 10 days to arrive in the Kingdom: its certificate should indicate the date the immunization was dispensed. “The ministry requested evidence of a poliomyelitis vaccine shot administered not less than four weeks to arrival in Saudi Arabia and not over 12 months ago. “Notwithstanding the polio vaccination evidence, travelers from countries with known cases of wild polio would be administered one dose of OPV at the entry point (the droplets Nigerians usually receive upon arrival in Saudi Arabia). “In addition to the presentation of a Covid-19 negative test result done 72 hours before arrival into the Kingdom, the medical team is required to provide isolation centres in Nigeria’s local clinics”.
