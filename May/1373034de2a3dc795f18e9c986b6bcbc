Former President of the Senate and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Bukola Saraki, has charged delegates to next week’s party primaries to shun sentiment and look out for agility, capability and combined experience in legislative and executive disposition. Addressing Gombe PDP delegates, yesterday, at the party’s Secretariat on Bauchi road, Saraki boasted of possessing all it takes to deliver good leadership characterised by inclusiveness, youth and women participation. He said: “Put sentiment aside, access all aspirants, decide and consider for your vote, who is most agile and intelligen. I know how the executive works, having been governor for eight years; and I know how the legislature works as senate president,” he stated, pleading: “Please give me the ticket.” He recalled that poverty rate in 2015 under the PDP government was 10 per cent, but rose to 35 per cent under APC. “Nigerians now know better, having gone through joblessness and hunger.” “I am the bridge between the North and the South,” he said. Gombe PDP chairman, Amnon Kwaskebe, described Saraki as worthy aspirant.
