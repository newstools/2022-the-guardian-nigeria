The highly anticipated film featuring Benedict Cumberbatch shows the actor in a fight scene with Gargantos. This scene is where the Chinese authorities frown at “Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness” as the background of the fight scene has a Chinese kiosk with Chinese characters for The Epoch Times. Epoch Times is a media company that disagrees with the Chinese Communist Party. This clip was first seen at the CinemaCon convention while Disney is yet to comment on the situation. The first release of Doctor Strange earned $109M. Other Marvel films in China since the pandemic that were not given release dates include the following: Black Widow, Eternals, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Some of the notions as to why these happened are politically affiliated.
