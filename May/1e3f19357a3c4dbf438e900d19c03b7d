They have dropped their letters and given reasons for stepping down.”
  
Adediran, who addressed the delegates, said the day was one that had long been awaited and the moment PDP had set aside for total emancipation of Lagos.

The election committee chairman, Prof. Walter Mboto, who declared Siminialayi as winner, announced that a total of 898 votes were cast and eight were voided.

The leadership tussle between Shehu Sagagi-led faction and that of former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Aminu Wali, escalated yesterday as nine gubernatorial aspirants split their loyalties along the two splitter groups. Aspirants already screened by the national body to participate in the primary included Muhammad Abacha, son of the former head of state, General Sani Abacha; Sadiq Wali, son of Ambassador Aminu Wali; former Chairman, Kano Public Complaint and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimin-Gado and former Ganduje’s Commissioner for Works, Muazu Magaji. Others were Ibrahim Little, Yusuf Dambatta, Dr. Yunusa Dangoni, Yusuf Bello and Ja’afar Sani Bello. At the primary conducted under the leadership of Shehu Sagagi-led PDP at Luggard House, delegates cast their votes for two aspirants, Mohammad Abacha and Ja’afa Sani Bello. The other seven aspirants who are loyal to Wali-led factional leadership joined other loyalists for the parallel primary held at Sani Abacha youth centre. Although, the Federal High Court, sitting in Kano had vacated the restricting order, asking the Sagagi-led leadership to stop parading himself as PDP chairman in Kano, the Wali faction argued that as long as Sagagi remains the leader, PDP still remains under the control of former governor, Engr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. THERE was also confusion at the venue of the primary election for Bauchi State when the name and picture of Governor Bala Mohammed appeared on the ballot paper. Mohammed, who is one of the party’s presidential aspirants, did not purchase the governorship form and was not screened. At the voting held at Zaranda Hotels, delegates were surprised to see the name of Mohammed on the ballot paper. The ballot paper carried two names: Senator Mohammed Bala Abdulkadir and the former Secretary to the State Government, Ibrahim Kashim. The result as announced by the chairman of the electoral panel, Hassan Ahmed, said total votes cast was 656 with a vote invalidated. He said Kashim polled all the 655 valid votes to emerge as the governorship candidate and “the only aspirant” who contested the primary. Speaking after the election, chairman of PDP in the state, Hamza Koshe Akuyam, described the exercise as free and fair. But when asked about the inclusion of Governor Mohammed on the ballot, he said it was a mistake from the PDP headquarters in Abuja. In his remarks, Kashim thanked the party and its supporters for electing him as the candidate, while urging them to be more united as the task ahead is more challenging.
