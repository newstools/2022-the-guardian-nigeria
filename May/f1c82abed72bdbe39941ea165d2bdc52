 Post Malone | Photo: XXL Mag Post Malone is reportedly expecting his first child with his long time girlfriend.   TMZ reports that the artist speaking to them said, “I’m excited for this next chapter in my life, I’m the happiest I’ve ever been, and for since I could remember I was sad. Time to take care of my body and my family and friends, and spread as much love as we can every day.” The news outlet also reported that the parents-to-be celebrated with a private party for friends and family in Southern California last weekend. Post Malone’s baby announcement comes a month before the expected drop date for his album Twelve Carat Toothache, scheduled for release next month. Since his move from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City three years ago, the singer has maintained a private life. “People wanted me to stay in LA — that’s where the work gets done — but I was fed up. There’s always something to do, and someone always wants something from ya — and I didn’t want to go crazy,” Post told Billboard in January. “The move to Utah has made things a lot better for my mental health. It’s been very, very good,” he continued. “It’s something I had to do because LA was kicking my ass. So it is tough, but it is worth it.” His girlfriend also lives a private life away from the spotlight.
