 Ncuti Gatwa Photo Marca Sex Education‘s Ncuti Gatwa has been unveiled as the new Doctor Who. The 29-year-old actor will take over from Jodie Whittaker as the 14th Time Lord on the science fiction show, becoming the first person of colour to play the role. Speaking to BBC News, the actor well known for his role as Eric Effiong in Netflix sitcom Sex Education said, “it feels really amazing. It’s a true honour. This role is an institution and it’s so iconic.”   A post shared by Ncuti Gatwa (@ncutigatwa) Speaking at the red carpet for the BAFTA TV Awards held on Sunday, he also noted that the role of Doctor Who “means a lot to so many people, including myself.” “There are no words to describe how I feel. A mix of deeply honored, more than thrilled and, of course, a little scared. This role and series mean so much to so many people around the world, including me, and each of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will do my best to do the same.” “Russell T. Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and to be able to work with him is a dream come true. His scripts are dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and full of danger. An actor’s metaphorical playground.” “The whole team has been very welcoming and really put their hearts into the development of the series. And as challenging as it is, I’m aware that I’m joining a really supportive family. Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart, but I’m going to give it all to this series.” Showrunner Russell T Davies revealed that Gatwa had impressed him in what he described as a blazing audition. “It was our last audition. It was our very last one,” the writer and producer said. “We thought we had someone, and then in he came and stole it.” “I’m properly, properly thrilled. It’s going to be a blazing future.” Gatwa will make his debut as Doctor Who in 2023.
