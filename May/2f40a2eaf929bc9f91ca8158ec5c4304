•Refutes plot to transfer super cop to DSS facility
The Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) has said information making the rounds that suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, was attacked by his fellow inmates in one of its correctional facilities, is false. Controller-General of Corrections, Haliru Nababa, made this known in a statement issued yesterday. The NCoS boss, who described the allegation as false information circulated by a “fake news peddler” to cause mischief, clarified that the agency was not considering transferring Kyari to the Department of State Services (DSS) custody as speculated. His words: “The author’s complete obliviousness of where and how detention of a suspect originates speaks volume of his ineptitude and the much his story can be relied upon. “For the record, Abba Kyari is one of the over 800 inmates in the location where he is being kept and notable individuals, including ex-governors, ministers, senators and other celebrities of higher social status have passed through without any threat to their lives.”
