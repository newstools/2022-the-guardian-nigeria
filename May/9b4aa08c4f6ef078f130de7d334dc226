The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), yesterday, revealed how the alleged billionaire drug baron, Chief Afam Mallinson Ukatu, imported N22 billion worth of tramadol.
   
NDLEA’s director, Media & Advocacy, Femi Babafemi, in a statement yesterday, said the agency’s ongoing investigation showed that the suspect imported into Nigeria in October 2019, two containers containing 1,284 cartons of tramadol with market value of over N22billion.
     
According to him, the discovery countered insinuations by some hirelings that the anti-narcotics agency has no evidence to pin a crime on Ukatu, who is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mallinson Group of companies.
   
He said: “After months of surveillance, Ukatu was eventually arrested on board a flight to Abuja at the Muritala Mohammed (MM2) terminal of the Lagos airport, Ikeja on Wednesday, April 13.
