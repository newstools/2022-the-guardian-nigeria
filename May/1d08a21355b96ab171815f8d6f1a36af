The National Association of Nigeria Travel Agencies (NANTA) has urged the Federal Government to quickly wade into the proposed strike by the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), due to the increase in the price of aviation fuel. Mrs Susan Akporiaye, President of NANTA, made the call in a statement on Saturday in Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that AON  had notified the public of its intention to shut down domestic flights from Monday, May 9, over the increase in the price of aviation fuel. Akporiaye called on the Minister of Aviation, Alhaji Hadi Sirika, to help resolve issues concerning domestic airline operators in the country. “We cannot afford another COVID-19 pandemic look-alike regime where Nigerians cannot move about freely, simply because airlines cannot operate due to poor operational environment. “The federal government must quickly intervene beyond mere promises. “We cannot continue like this and to think of it, the mere announcement by airline operators of Nigeria that they are off the sky on Monday, has sent panic around the globe. “Nigerians returning home and those coming to do business in our country have cancelled their flights,” she said.
Akporiaye noted that her phones had been busy as travel agents and travellers from all over the world wanted to know the latest developments concerning the issue in the industry. “NANTA appeals to the Minister of Aviation to rally round support for AON members. “And to think that we are also in the heat of preparations for 2023 elections when electoral materials and campaign trains would move from one end of the country to another, calls for serious measures. “We cannot continue like this, it is damaging to our image as a nation and our business,” she said.
