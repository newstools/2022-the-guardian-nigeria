strong>• It’s a lie from pit of hell, says APC The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Ekiti State has alleged plan by the All Progressives Congress (APC) led-government to set up a task force with a mission to disrupt the governorship polls. A letter, written by Owoseni Ajayi and Associates, counsel to the party’s governorship candidate, Chief Segun Oni, to Director of State Services (DSS) and made available to journalists, Ekiti State Commissioner of Police and prominent Ekiti indigenes, stated that the two existing drivers’ unions in the state had pitched tent openly with the governorship candidate of the APC and had been embarking on dangerous actions towards the peaceful campaign of other political parties. It further stated that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) normally relies on the drivers to transport sensitive materials to their destinations before and on the election day but that the drivers had compromised and could no longer be entrusted with such huge responsibility. This, it stated, was capable of putting the much needed free, fair and peaceful elections in jeopardy. Owoseni, therefore, urged the security agencies in Ekiti to rise up and challenge Fayemi and his already constituted task force to forestall uncontrollable chaos. He also called for transfer of the Chief Security Officer (CSO) to the Governor, Mr. Ajayi Adeyanju, to another command to ensure peaceful conduct of the elections. MEANWHILE, spokesman of the APC, Mr. Segun Dipe, has described the allegation as figment of the imagination and a lie from the bottom of hell. He said the SDP had always been making allegations instead of focusing on the real campaign and what it intends to do for the electorate. “Those allegations don’t exist. They are just crying wolves where there is none. How can a sitting governor resolve to cause mayhem and disrupt an election that is most certain that his party would win?” he queried.
