Gunmen on Sunday, killed Mr Zakari Kigbu, a former Federal Commissioner of National Population Commission (NPC) at his residence in Azuba community near Lafia, Nasarawa State capital. ACP Ramhan Nansel, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Nasarawa State Command, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lafia. According to Nansel, the gunmen stormed the victim’s residence at about 12:30 a.m. and shot at him before abducting two of his children- a boy and a girl. The Police Command spokesman said that upon receiving a report of the incident, the Commissioner of Police, Adesina Soyemi,  immediately deployed Police personnel comprising Anti Kidnapping unit and Police Mobile Force to the scene. Nansel said the CP had also visited the scene for on-the-spots assessment and condole with the family. He said the police would not rest on their oars to ensure that the abducted children were rescued unhurt. “The police will carry out a comprehensive investigation to unravel, arrest and prosecute those behind the dastardly act,” Nansel said. The PPRO, therefore, called on members of the public to avail the police of useful information that could lead to the rescue of the abducted victims and the arrest of the perpetrators. The deceased was a former National President, Eggon Cultural, and Development Association.
