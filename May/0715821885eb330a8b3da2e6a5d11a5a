The creator speaking to Variety revealed that the second season of the famed Korean series would question whether humanity can conquer all as a united front. He said, “Humanity is going to be put to a test through those games once again.” He added, “I want to ask the question, ‘Is true solidarity between humans possible?'” Dong-hyuk also pointed out that the disconnect among players accounted for the many deaths in season one. “If they were capable of talking with one another, of co-operating with one another, I do agree that there could have been a possibility that we could have seen more winners,” he added. Squid Game season two is set to return to Netflix in 2023 or 2024. He added that he already has three pages of ideas about season two and is in talks with Netflix to determine the show’s future. The first season of Squid Game, released in 2021, followed a group of 100 people attempting to pay off their debts by participating in childlike games with a violent twist. The more of them that died, the more money they could win. In April, Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed that season two of the acclaimed series would return with two actors from the past season. He said, “Gi-hun for sure. He will be back, “he went ahead to say I believe the Front Man will be back too.” Lee Byung-hun, who played the role of Squid Game overseer Hwang In-ho of 456 players, is expected for a return in season two of the dystopian drama. In its first outing, Squid Game topped in 94 countries, reaching number one with an estimate of 142M viewership in four weeks.
