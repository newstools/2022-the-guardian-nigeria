Sir: April 22 was International Mother Earth Day 2022, to raise awareness about environmental protection and acknowledge the global climate crisis which is getting worse by the day. There is a growing global drive and commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (a climate-neutral world) by mid-century. The goal is to keep global temperature to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels, in line with the Paris Agreement. With this year’s theme as Invest In Our Planet, the global ‘race to zero’ will once again be emphasised while proffering some key solutions that will serve Nature in good stead as regards delivering the greenhouse gas reductions needed by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement. The importance of renewable energy to climate change cannot be overemphasised as it minimises carbon pollution and has a much lower impact on our environment. With investment and grant support from the United States African Development Foundation (USADF) and other funders and partners, Diamond Development Initiatives (DDI) is proud to be a part of that global movement taking the sustainable energy route in the ‘Race to Zero.’ With its Renewable Energy Support portfolio, DDI has supported the provision of sustainable power to underserved communities in Nigeria through over 40 energy entrepreneurs – contributing to a healthier ecosystem. We are once again reminded by the United Nations that the healthier our ecosystems are, the healthier the planet will be – and its people. Hence, if investments are made to restore our damaged ecosystems, it will contribute to the global quest to ‘‘end poverty, combat climate change and prevent mass extinction.’’ We are all in this together.
