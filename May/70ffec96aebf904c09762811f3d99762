The Senatorial ambition of Prince Ned Nwoko received a boost, yesterday, as traditional rulers in Delta North Senatorial District, also known as Anioma, picked him as their preferred aspirant ahead for the 2023 general elections. This is contained in a communiqué issued following their deliberations at a meeting attended by over 40 traditional rulers at the palace of the Asagba of Asaba, Prof. Chike Edozien. Reading the communiqué after the meeting, chaired by the Asagba, Vice Chairman of Delta North Traditional Rulers Council and Obi of Abavo, Uche Irenuwa, and Secretary of the Council and Obi of Atuma-Iga Kingdom, Daniel Chukwuka Ogbodu, said they unanimously supported Nwoko as their sole aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the election. The monarchs, who represent various communities in the nine local government areas that make up Delta North, said Nwoko had demonstrated admirable patriotism, commitment and passion for the peace, unity and development of Anioma land, Delta State and Nigeria. In the 15-point communiqué, the monarchs said they were convinced the aspirant had brought pride and glory to Anioma people, especially with the establishment of Sports University in  Idumuje -Ugboko, which was recently approved by the Federal Government and granted operational licence by the National Universities Commission (NUC).
