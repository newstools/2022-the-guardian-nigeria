National Consultative Front (NCFront), umbrella body of the ‘3 Force’ Movement and Political Alternatives to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has adopted the Labour Party (LP) as its mega party for ‘3rd Force’ stakeholders and allies for the 2023 elections. The group, in a statement, yesterday, said the adoption followed the new rapprochement between the leadership of the Labour Movement and the hierarchy of the Labour Party. It added that the formal endorsement comes on the heels of the recent successful meetings and activities of the separate political commissions of the NLC and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) with their allies like the Femi Falana, who led The Political Alternative Movement (TPAM) in the civil society, towards repositioning the LP as the People’s Alternative Platform for rescuing Nigeria ahead of the 2023 general elections. The statement reads: “With the adoption of Labour Party as our 3rd Force Mega Party penultimate week, the NCFront has since commenced the fusion of its structures of over 20 million members and supporters nationwide into the Labour Party. Consequently, our teeming members all over Nigeria and in Diaspora have been directed to register immediately as members of the Labour Party at all designated registration centres, both online and physically at the ward level, to be able to take part in the ongoing electoral programmes of the party for the 2023 elections.” “We also wish to state clearly that the NCFront is also particularly enthused by the non-partisan strategic nature of the Labour Party, as a people-centered, Pan-Nigeria political platform that can inclusively serve the interests of all Nigerians irrespective of their ethnic, religious and social inclinations, in uniting the country towards a momentous development that can accommodate and serve the diversities of Nigeria. “Therefore, with the novel synergy between the Labour Party and the NCFront, the convening platform of the 3rd Force Movement, which is also today the largest political mass movement in the country, Nigerians can rest assured that the glorious future we all desire for our dear country, is now achievable by 2023, especially with the brewing implosion hovering over the ruling cartel of APC and PDP, which will soon burst into unpreventable disintegration after their party primaries.” The group added that an inclusive Consensus Technical Committee to screen presidential aspirants and other candidates of ‘3rd Force’ allied parties towards the adoption of a single line of candidates across all 2023 elections, will be set up next month (June) after the conclusion of all party primaries.”
