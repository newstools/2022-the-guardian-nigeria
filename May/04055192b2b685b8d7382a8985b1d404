Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has reabsorbed his cabinet members and other appointees, who earlier resigned and later stepped down for a consensus aspirant at the recent primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Governor Diri disclosed this, yesterday, at the 76th State Executive Council (SEC) meeting in Government House, Yenagoa.
Commending the peaceful conduct of the aspirants during the exercise, the governor said it was cheering that most of them put the interest of the party above their personal ambition by stepping down when the need arose. He stated the PDP would always recognise and reward loyal party members, who made sacrifices, accordingly. While congratulating winners of the primaries, Diri enjoined them to reach out to the losers for reconciliation and work together for the success of the party in the coming elections, stressing that the exercise was a family affair and that the PDP was the ultimate winner. He advised those, who could not make it this time, to see the results as an act of God, adding that the Electoral Act wrought a lot of upsets in the political space. “Let me use the opportunity to appreciate most of the aspirants whom we spoke to, some of them even on the day of the primaries, while some on the eve of the primaries and for very obvious reasons and respect for the party and the government, stepped down for others,” he said. “For the political appointees, who stepped down and did not contest in the primaries, their appointments are hereby restored. Therefore, the Acting Chief of Staff is directed to ensure that all of those people are restored to their appointive positions,” he directed. The Bayelsa helmsman condemned the killing of a youth at Ogbia during the House of Assembly primaries, adding that politicians who are found culpable of contravening the Electoral Act would be dealt with.
