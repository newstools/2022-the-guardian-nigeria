INSPECTOR-GENERAL of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has upgraded the Nigeria Police Crime and Incident Database (NPC & IDB) Centre to enhance investigations and strategic operational and tactical planning. The improved platform would, in turn, facilitate easy identification of suspects, crime location, modus operandi, Global Positioning System (GPS) and geolocate crimes, among others. Force spokesman, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, who made the disclosure in Abuja, pointed out that the move followed the sophistication of criminals, who now apply technology to perpetuate their nefarious activities. The centre was commissioned in 2020 by President Muhammadu Buhari.
