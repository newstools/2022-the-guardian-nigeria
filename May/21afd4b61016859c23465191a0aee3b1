In an interview, the actress told sources that in a previous relationship, she was locked up and raped daily by her ex-boyfriend. The popular actress revealed that her sister would intervene pulling her out of such scenarios. Ibrahim who did not reveal the identity of her ex-boyfriend said she also noted to her ex-boyfriend that what he did was rape but his reaction was that they were in a relationship.
“I told him what he did was rape but he said we were in a relationship. But was I ready? That was the question. Did I say I was in the mood? She added “I kept saying no, ‘stop it, stop it. You pin me down and you’re doing whatever you wanted to do. You’re smiling saying, ‘don’t worry’, and you’re kissing whilst I’m crying, that means you’re a rapist and I had to leave that relationship.” The actress said she ‘‘fought’’ her ‘‘way out of that relationship’’ narrating that he locked her up and her sister Sonia came to her rescue. Explaining further about her ordeal she said, “Everyday, he wanted to do something and that’s rape.” In her final words of the interview, the actress advised that should report men who abused them in their relationships whether or not they are in one.
