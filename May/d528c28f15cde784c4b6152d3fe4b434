The Police Command in Cross River State has debunked the reports of the killing of 20 people in Cross River by the Ambazonian militants from Cameroon. Describing it as a spurious and subversive claim, the Command through its Public Relations Officer, SP Irene Ugbo in a statement advised residents to disregard the claims. “The Command hereby advise members of the public to disregard this information currently trending on social media platforms, as it is subversive. “Measures are being taken to review the source of this distasteful information intended to spread fear and panic,” Ugbo said in the statement. “Consequent upon the above, the Police Command hereby warns the respective bloggers/online operators to always cross-check facts from established authorities before sending such unverified information for public consumption. “Finally, the Police Command is resolute in discharging her statutory functions in collaboration with other sister agencies to keep the state peaceful and safe at all times.”
