 performs onstage at the Hollywood Palladium at Hollywood Palladium on March 25, 2016 in Los Angeles, California. Isaiah Lee, the man who attacked Dave Chappelle onstage, has pleaded not guilty to all four charges against him.   TMZ reports that Lee made his first appearance in an L.A courtroom on Friday morning to face four misdemeanour charges. Appearing with his right arm in a cast and a sling, he was represented by a public defender who informed the judge that Lee had suffered a broken arm. Lee would have to pay a $30,000 bail before he gets out of a jail cell and would be under a protective order after his release. The order will require that he stays at least 100 yards away from the Hollywood Bowl, Dave and any other venue at which the comedian performs. While the L.A. County D.A George Gascon passed on felony charges against Lee, the case was handed to the City Attorney, who charged Lee with possession of a weapon with intent to assault and unauthorisedD access to the stage area during a performance. If convicted, Isaiah Lee will face up to 18 months in country jail. Isiah Lee climbed on stage and threw Dave Chappelle to the ground while the comedian was finishing a set during the “Netflix Is A Joke” comedy festival at the Hollywood Bowl on Tuesday night.
