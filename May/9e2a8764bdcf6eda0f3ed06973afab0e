The song which promises to take you on a ride with its stellar production reveals one thing: Jhello is ready to take on the music industry. In “Say Something,” Jhello expresses his desire for the woman of his dreams. She makes him feel wanted and gives him reasons to believe true love is still possible. He is overwhelmed by her show of love and affection; such that it leaves him speechless and feels he doesn’t need to say much rather he would show his feelings. In an upbeat tempo, this is a toast to music enthusiasts and is a revelation of his musical vision. Say Something was mixed and mastered by Skips Ti. To listen, click here
