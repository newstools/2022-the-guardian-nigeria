NetPOS has secured approval from the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) to roll out its Contactless App for commercial use in Nigeria.
 
The app converts NFC-enabled devices to accept card payment using contactless cards.
 
In a statement, Chief Commercial and Business Officer, NetPOS, Bamidele Omolehinwa, said that the app is a significant value-driven solution for micro and small enterprises (SMEs) businesses in Nigeria, which are often neglected by banks in Point of Sales (POS) issuance and can now take advantage of their mobile phones to accept payments.  The app disables some part of the Android OS functionality such as recording and screen capture while operating the app to ensure malicious intentions to capture people’s data are not permitted,” Omolehinwa said.
 
Head, Merchant Services, NetPOS, Soji Ajayi, stated the company’s plans to work with other Fintechs to extend the reach and capabilities of the app.
