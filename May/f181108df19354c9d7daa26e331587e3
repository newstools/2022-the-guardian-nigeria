Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps, Boboye Oyeyemi, yesterday,  said  about nine fatal crashes, involving  deaths of students who made use of highways in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), were recorded between  January and  March.
  
Oyeyemi disclosed this at the Road Safety Grant Programme, organised by the Automobile and Touring Club of Nigeria (ATCN) in collaboration with  Greenlight Initiative.
  
The corps marshal, who was represented by the FCT Sector Commander, Samuel Ochi, said children and adults, aged between 10 and 45 years made up of  70 per cent of  Nigerian road users.
 
He said:  “With the statistics we have fatal crashes, nine of them led to the deaths of students in the FCT from the period of January- March.
 
“The importance of this training cannot be over emphasised. That is why I want to commend the Automobile and Touring Club for bringing these categories of persons that are susceptible to road crashes.” Earlier, Executive Director of  Greenlight Initiative, Simon Obi, said road traffic fatalities are the leading cause of death among young people around the world, regretting that the tragic incidents kept repeating itself among young Nigerians.
 
According to Obi, researchers have established that such reoccurrence could be attributed to their inadequate knowledge, awareness and information about the impact of road traffic crashes, lamenting that the development has hampered their safety on the road.
