As the Federal Government continues to deal with challenges facing the country, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has restated the nation’s trust in God, while also praying that the Almighty will fulfil the heart desires of all Muslims and every Nigerian. “I pray that the Almighty God will continually help you and help our government to tackle every one of the various challenges as we confront them,” he said. Osinbajo spoke at the Ramadan reception hosted, yesterday, by President Muhammadu Buhari to celebrate Eid-el Fitr at the Banquet Hall of the State House. He thanked God for giving Buhari “all that you have required to tackle these challenges and for giving you the life and strength to tackle the challenges and surmount the challenges.” Osinbajo also noted that despite the challenges, Nigeria has remained united, while acknowledging, “Every generation of leaders is confronted with its own problems. There is no leader that is not confronted with his own or her own problems.”
