Blames ex-President Jonathan for not restructuring Nigeria before handing over Sokoto State governor and presidential aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Aminu Tambuwal, has advised the party’s national delegates in Lagos State not to mortgage the future of their children by voting for the wrong aspirant. He said power in the wrong hand would spell doom for the country. He also urged the delegates to ensure they vote for the right presidential aspirant at the primary election to safeguard the future of the country. Tambuwal, who spoke yesterday in Lagos when he paid a visit to former Deputy National Chairman of the PDP, Chief Olabode George, advised the delegates to critically assess the aspirants’ track records in choosing the party’s presidential flagbearer, adding that they must go for the most competent, professional and experienced one. He, however, urged unity and understanding among PDP members in Lagos State. Tambuwal, while canvassing for votes from delegates of the party in Akure, Ondo State capital, yesterday, blamed former President, Goodluck Jonathan, for not allowing the amendment of the country’s constitution for restructuring before handing over power. He said that Jonathan should have also allowed the proper reform of the electoral system. According to him, restructuring the country would have deepened the nation’s democracy if the former president had listened to the agitations of Nigerians. The PDP presidential aspirant decried a situation whereby the centre is overloaded, stressing that there should have been more powers to states and local councils. “So, I guarantee you that in me, you would have a president who can communicate, understand issues concerning the security of our country and its development. “When we win the election, We will have the government of PDP. We shall bring about and return old good days,” he added.
