The crisis rocking Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) nominations ahead of the 2023 general elections has deepened. In many states, the party leadership is facing challenges in getting support for aspirants anointed by godfathers. In Cross River, a group, Cross River State PDP Professionals (CROSPP), has cautioned the leadership against fielding a green horn as its governorship candidate.  The warning comes on the heels of speculations that one Arthur Jarvis Archibong is being propped up by a leader in the state. But other frontline candidates like Senator Gershom Bassey, Daniel Asuquo, and Nkoyo Toyo strongly oppose the move. In a statement, leader of the group, Okon Edem-Ita, said they were against any form of imposition. The party is equally heading for another major predicament in Edo State over alleged manipulation of the ad hoc delegates list sent to Abuja for the national chairman’s approval. Some party members, including the state secretary, Hilary Otsu, alleged that Governor Godwin Obaseki had dropped the party’s “authentic list for another written from the Government House.” In Akwa-Ibom State, the situation is still stormy, as mixed reactions continue to trail Governor Udom Emmanuel’s announcement of his Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Umo Eno, as his preferred successor. A member of the House of Representatives and gubernatorial aspirant, Onofiok Luke, said he was present at the stakeholders’ meeting, but was never informed of the agenda. According to him, he honoured the governor’s invitation “out of respect and as a loyal party man.”
