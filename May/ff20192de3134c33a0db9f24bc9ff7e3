Eleven schools took part in the programme, which would be concluded with the primary school session on May 21. Speaking on the competition, Ikoyi Club Swimming Section Chairman, Kunle Adeniji, said he was happy with the turnout and standard of the one-day tournament. Adeniji said: “This has been one of the cardinal developmental programmes as far as swimming in Nigeria is concerned and we are delighted with the standard and already looking forward to the primary school category next week.” He commended Zenith Bank for the sponsorship, which, he stressed, is getting bigger. “We cannot thank Zenith Bank enough. They put smiles on the faces of these young swimmers and also prepare them for future challenges for the country.” I am really excited as I look forward to the Primary school event next week,” Adeniji added. Nigeria Swimming Federation President, Babatunde Fatayi-Williams, expressed delight at the championship, noting that the tournament would continue to help Nigeria in its quest to be among the leading nations in Africa.
