The actor reportedly died on Wednesday after a long battle with diabetes. It was his colleague and movie producer Femi Adewale who broke the news of Richards’ death on Facebook on Thursday. Adewale, former Head of Programmes at Galaxy TV Lagos wrote: “Good night Gbenga Richards. Another Nollywood Icon is gone. A gem is lost. My friend and brother is gone to be with his creator. May the lord rest your soul in Jesus’ name.” It will be recalled that late last year, Moviedom called attention to the plight of the actor after blogger and director at African Entertainment Network Emdee David shared a post on his social media handles where he revealed that the actor was seriously ill and needed help urgently. Aged 60, the actor and star of critically acclaimed movies such as Sango, Mirror in the Sun, Fighting Machine, and 30 Days, who looked twice his size in a video that Emdee David also shared in September 2021 said back then: “My name is Gbenga Richards, I’m sure a lot of you out there know me. My friends and fans and colleagues have encouraged me to do this, so I’ve decided to make my cry public. I’m really undergoing a very serious health issue. I have acute high blood pressure and suffering from acute diabetes. I live on medication right now. That I’m alive speaking to you this wonderful day is by the grace of God. So, I’m calling on well-loving Nigerians please come to my aid. Don’t allow me to die.”
