Spanish authorities have issued an arrest warrant based on using fake IDs and taking up personalities during his time in Spain. Leviev (real name: Shimon Hayut), during his time in Spain, presented a fake ID to a police officer in 2019. Although there were initially plans to drop the case, the Spanish police are revisiting it after speaking with the Norwegian journalist who unveiled the Tinder Swindler. Recall that we reported earlier that the Israeli Leviev family is suing him for impersonation. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1736446 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani.png" alt="" width="1280" height="769" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani.png 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani-995x598.jpg 995w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani-320x192.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani-640x385.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber-Heard-Milani-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The last has not been heard of the ex-couple, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard’s message court case. While we are all aware of the details of abuse, an interesting story has emerged from the case and it involves the makeup brand, Milani. Showing the court, Milani Cosmetics’ All-In-One Correcting Kit, Heard’s attorney Elaine Bredehoft told the jury how she will use it to cover her bruises when she was physically abused before her divorce in 2016. Milani, refuting this in a TikTok video, stated that the palette she claimed to use did not launch until December 2017. Hmmm… BBNaija Khafi Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Khafi Kareem is facing a misconduct probe at the UK’s Met Police over her appearance on the show. Khafi had requested unpaid leave from her superiors back in 2019 and an approval to appear on the reality show to “promote the Met Police” globally. However, while the leave was granted, the Met Police denied her request to appear on the show, and she was instructed to not participate in further auditions, interviews or shows. At the hearing, Khafi admitted to surrendering her laptop to the show’s organisers. She, however, denied allegations of breaching standards in respect of “orders and instructions” and “discreditable conduct.” Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna | Photo – Complex It is no news that Blac Chyna and the Kardashian family have been in a legal battle since 2017, after Chyna accused them of damaging her brand and abusing her. The lawsuit was filed after Rob leaked nude photos of Chyna on Instagram and accused her of drug abuse, alcohol abuse, and infidelity. Now, the Kardashian-Jenner family has asked the Los Angeles Superior Court to dismiss her economic and emotional distress claims, while describing the claims as ‘absurd’. In the meantime, Chyna has offered no accounting to support her request for $109,635,021 in economic damage and $36,000,000 in general damages for emotional distress.
