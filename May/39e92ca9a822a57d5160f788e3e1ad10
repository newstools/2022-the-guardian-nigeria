The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has finalised plans to host the country’s first-ever Nigeria U-18 Basketball Championships, with the goal of increasing youth involvement in sports, particularly basketball. Between May 27 and 30, 2022, the competition will begin with zonal elimination among the 36 states of the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, after which the champions and first runners-up from the zones will travel to Abuja for the finals, which will take place between June 3 and 8, 2022. In a statement signed by Mohammed Manga, the Ministry’s Director (Press and Public Relations), the Ministry called on state governments to ensure active participation of students and youth in the games  so as to build  talent development. This, according to the Ministry, will go a long way in curbing youth restiveness across Nigeria. It praised President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration for its commitment to the development of grassroots sports in the country and pledged to continue to create an enabling environment for the full implementation of government policies, projects, and programmes in line with the current administration’s policy thrust, particularly in the area of youth and sports development. According to the statement, the Ministry will roll out grassroots basketball development programmes in the coming weeks, with an emphasis on the organisation of basketball leagues for both men and women, as well as sponsorship. Working with retired Nigerian basketball stars and active professionals, the initiatives will also focus on the development of local coaches and referees, as well as the stimulation of basketball academies across the country.
