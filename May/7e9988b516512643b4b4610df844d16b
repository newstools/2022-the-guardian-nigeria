Gaten Matarazzo, Maya Hawke, Natalia Dyer, Sadie Sink, Joe Keery, Joseph Quinn, Caleb McLaughlin, and Priah Ferguson spoke in an interview about the show, and when the cast where asked to rename the series, suggestions where made but they agreed on one thing. They also discussed their time on set, and whether or not they’ve seen Bollywood films. “I am the most mature in the cast,” Caleb, who portrays Lucas Sinclair in Stranger Things, stated. I’m the one with the headphones on and am staring at everyone. Then there are other times when I can go all out. When Sadie (Sink) goes around the stage, she constantly appears to be gliding. Priah (Ferguson) jumps right in….she makes me feel like I’m in not doing my job. Watch video here.
