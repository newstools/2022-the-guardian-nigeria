Despite lack of updates on monkeypox outbreak in the country from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the United Kingdom (U.K.), the United States (U.S.) and Europe have continued to record fresh cases. According to the latest Situation Report on Update on Monkeypox in Nigeria, published on April 30, by the NCDC, since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox. A total of 46 suspected cases have been reported between January 1 and April 30, 2022. Of the suspected cases, 15 were confirmed from seven states – Adamawa (three), Lagos (three), Cross River (two), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja (two), Kano (two), Delta (two) and Imo (one) – but no death has been recorded. From September 2017 to April 30, 2022, 558 suspected cases have been reported from 32 states in the country. Despite enquires by The Guardian for the most recent situation report on monkeypox in Nigeria, there was no reply from the NCDC as of press time. But, yesterday, the DailyMailUK Online reported that another 14 monkeypox patients have been spotted in England as the tropical virus continues to sweep the world, amid fears it might have mutated to spread easily between humans. UK Health Security Agency bosses (UKHSA) have now confirmed 71 cases in the unprecedented global outbreak. At least one child has been sickened so far — but no one has died. Officials have also warned the worst may yet come. England has logged 70 cases since the first case was publicised on May 7, while Scotland has recorded one. None have yet been detected in Wales or Northern Ireland. Officials said a ‘notable proportion’ has occurred among gay and bisexual men but have not provided an exact breakdown. No gender or age details have been shared either.
