Youths, under the auspices of Bello Ambassador Network (BAN), gathered in Awka, Anambra State, at the weekend, to pledge their support to the presidential aspiration of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, ahead of the 2023 general elections. Fielding questions from newsmen during a rally in Awka, the National Coordinator of the group, Anthony Edogbo, said Nigeria needed a 21st century leadership with youthful, responsive, energetic and intellectual capacities. Edogbo explained that Bello is capable of replicating the good things he had done for his state in Nigeria, adding that the youths came out on their own to show massive support and solidarity to one of their own. Edogbo, who is the Technical Assistant to the governor on Private Sector and Digital Economy, said time for sentiments and ethic politics were over, urging Nigerians to vote for the one capable of tackling the current security challenges. According to him, “Bello is one of the governors that have made Nigerian youths proud and we’re demanding for a youthful president, we’re demanding for one of our own to be given the ticket to become the flag bearer of the APC, and the next Nigerian president.”
