Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Farah Dagogo, who has been in police detention for six days, has fallen ill and was rushed to hospital by the police. A statement issued yesterday by his media aide, Ibrahim Lawal, said Dagogo complained of stomach and chest complications, which made police officers to rush him to an undisclosed hospital for treatment. Contacted, the state police spokesperson, Grace Iringe Koko, confirmed the development, saying: “ Yes, he is responding  to treatment now and he is fine, there is no cause for alarm.” Speaking further, Lawal alleged that Governor Nyesom Wike and his Camp Commandant, Efeturi Irikefe, were planning to pin criminal charges on Dagogo, who is representing Degema/Bonny Federal Constituency in the National Assembly. “We received from source that Governor Wike and his Camp Commandant, are stopping at nothing to put Dagogo in perpetual detention and they have already manufactured more charges of murder, kidnap, armed robbery, illegal bunkering and attacks on security agencies, among other charges, to be hung on the neck of the governorship aspirant,” Lawal claimed. He further alleged that the state was also planning to arrest and harm the families of Dagogo, his staff, particularly his aides and others close to him. “For the umpteenth time, our earlier position stands that Dagogo’s life is still in danger, this time, with that of his families, close friends, associates and his staff, particularly his aides. Contacted for reactions to the allegations, the Special Assistant to  Governor Wike on media, Kelvin  Ebiri,  said the matter was already in court and it is a case between the  police and Dagogo,  hence the government could not speak further.
