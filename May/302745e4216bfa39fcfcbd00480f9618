Chris Rock, who is 57, made this joke stating that he has “most of my hearing back”during his appearance on stage at The Royal Albert Hall in London for his Ego Death comedy tour. He thrilled his 5,000 guests who had before now predicted a collection of Smith jokes. In his opening, he said “I’m okay, if anyone was wondering… I got most of my hearing back.” In addition, he said to the audience “People expect me to talk about the bulls**t, I’m not going to talk about it right now.” Smith, 53, had slapped Rock at the Oscars in March after the comedian told a GI Jane joke about his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith’s head. The harsh outburst resulted in an uproar across social media and resulted in Smith being banned from the Academy Awards for 10 years. During his tour, Rock did, nevertheless, suggest to fans that he would “eventually” talk about it “on Netflix” and alleged he was not going to talk about it unless he gets paid for it with his name written on a cheque. Chris Rock closed off by saying, “Anyone who says words hurt has never been punched in the face.”
