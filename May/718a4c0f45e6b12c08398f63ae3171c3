The 2022 Access Bank-UNICEF Charity Polo Tournament gallops off today at the Fifth Chukker Lawns of Kangimi Resort, Kaduna, with teams from across the country vying for honours. Revered as one of the biggest charity polo platforms in the world, the UNICEF event will be decided in two stages, with teams battling for the Usman Dantata Cup and the events’ second most coveted prize, the Access Bank Cup in the first stage. According to organisers of the event, the second and grand finale promises to be one of the most exciting in years, pitching title holders, Fifth Chukker, Jos Malcomines and four regulars in a winner-takes-all chase for the UNICEF Cup and tournament top prize, the Charity Shield. Executive Director, Personal Banking, Access Bank Plc., Victor Etuokwu, who confirmed the tournament dates, said the title sponsors and their partners, have taken their commitment to UNICEF Charity polo fundraising platform to a new level, with the commissioning of fully equipped 60 classroom blocks in Kaduna State. The project that berthed a new education system in Kaduna was a contribution by the bank alongside the partners, Fifth Chukker Polo & Country Club and well-meaning individuals, to the sustenance of the charity platform that has for years benefited communities and powering rural women in Kaduna. “The partners are delighted that the Access Bank UNICEF Charity Shield is achieving its main objective of reaching out to the less privileged children in the society, and we are not relenting on this laudable intervention, there are millions of vulnerable Nigerian children out of school and many of them are from the north. “This year’s tournament is more than an affirmation of our commitment to socio-economic wellbeing of mankind and acknowledgement of the impact the initiative has had on the lives of the orphaned and vulnerable children in northern Nigeria especially in Kaduna state,” he emphasised. One of the major highlights of the opening stage of the yearly charity event is undoubtedly the Children’s Day celebration with the First Lady of Kaduna State, Hajia Aisha Ummi EL-Rufai, as the Mother of the Day, the organisers said, adding that proceeds from gate takings and donations is channeled to UNICEF in support of orphans and vulnerable children.
