After months of negotiation over modernisation of the market, the Lagos State Government through a joint team of Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the State Environment and Special Offences Unit (Task Force), has given occupants of Alaba Rago market 14 days to vacate.  According to him, the demolition of the area is in conformity with government’s  agenda on environment and security, adding that the government  was bothered by the shanties and the filthy condition of the area, hence modernising it would be at the best interest of the occupiers.
    
He urged the residents not to read ethnic and religious motives into the exercise, noting that Lagos State is a convergence point for all Nigerians, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or tribe.  On his part, Jejeloye, noted that several meetings have been held with major stakeholders in the past and that the demolition should have taken place during the Ramadan. He said government was sensitive to delay it for those, who travelled for the Ramadan to be around. Jejeloye warned that after the ultimatum for the residents to temporarily relocate for the cleaning up and modernisation, the team would not listen to further excuses from the occupiers.
