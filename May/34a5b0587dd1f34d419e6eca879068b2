He said he received $8 million for “City of Lies,” $10 million for Murder on the Orient Express” and $13.5 million for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.” In 2018, Depp was paid $3.5 million for “The Professor,” an independent film, and $1 million for “Waiting for the Barbarians,” another indie film. In January 2019, he was to have been paid $3 million for a film called “Minamata”.
“It was very, very difficult to keep Minamata together,” Whigham said. “The financing became shaky, the budget had to come down, Johnny’s fee came down in order to save the movie.” Also testifying on Monday was Travis McGivern, a member of Depp’s security team. McGivern said he was present for one argument between the couple at their Los Angeles penthouse during which Heard punched Depp in the face, threw a can of Red Bull at him and spit at him. The bodyguard said he escorted Depp out “for his safety.” “My job is to ensure the safety and well-being of my clients,” he said. “It was time to do my job and get him out of there.” Depp filed the defamation complaint in the United States after losing a separate libel case in London in November 2020 that he brought against The Sun for calling him a “wife-beater.” Depp, a three-time Oscar nominee, and Heard met in 2009 on the set of the film “The Rum Diary” and were married in February 2015. Their divorce was finalized two years later.
