Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, yesterday, said Nigeria had moved from being weak to a failing nation under the current administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari. Saraki, a former governor of Kwara State, said this while addressing Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegates at the state party secretariat in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The former Senate President, who is one of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the PDP for the 2023 elections, said though the country was weak before Buhari came to power in 2015, it had moved to a failing nation owing to failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration to govern well. He stated that the country needs someone who will rescue it from total collapse, saying that he is in a better position to transform Nigeria to a safe and economic haven for all Nigerians. Saraki maintained that the country needed someone with the capacity to unite its people, urging the electorate to ensure they participate in next year’s general elections by voting for someone with capacity as President. He said: “Before Buhari and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) came into power, we were a weak nation, but now, we are a failing nation. There is a difference between a weak nation, a failing nation and a failed nation. We have moved from a weak to a failing nation. But we need someone who can rescue us from degenerating into a state of failed nation. “We must elect someone who has the capacity. We need a man with the experience. We need someone who can unite Nigeria and I am that person. We need someone who can unite both the old and the young together. Let us vote for the person that can unite the country. “I am assuring you that I am the one as I have the capacity to do it. This country needs someone with energy to move the country forward.”
