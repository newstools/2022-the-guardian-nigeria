Cruise made this known on the Late Late Show hosted by James Corden where the actor talked about how Lady Gaga’s song which is the soundtrack has impacted the film. “She’s incredible,” Cruise told host James Corden. “She’s not just on the soundtrack. She actually helped to compose the score and it was incredible.” He narrated how Gaga brought the song to him and Hans Zimmer while they were struggling to make the right choice. The “Top Gun” star emphasised the importance of soundtrack and music in a film as “this one was very particular.” Speaking further, he added “There was just a sound and something we were looking for and it just wasn’t right. She presented her song to us and it just opened up the whole movie. It just opened those doors to the emotional core of the film that we had. In that moment, things just came together in such a beautiful way. Her song that she’d written just fell right in and became, really, the underlying score and the heartbeat of our film.” “Top Gun” is a sequel to 1986’s Top Gun and was initially slated for release in 2019.
