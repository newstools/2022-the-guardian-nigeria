The Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, approved N2,024,935,000 for the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to facilitate purchase of 52 operational vehicles. Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, who briefed newsmen alongside his Information and Culture counterpart, Lai Mohammed, and Minister of State for Power, Jedy Agba, explained that the automobiles comprised 27 Buffalo Double Cabin, MG 2021 model, 15 Toyota Hilux four wheel drive Premium Package 2020 model and 10 Toyota Hiace ambulance bus with full option. “This is done to enhance the capacity of the agency to combat crime and criminality in Nigeria. It’s my belief that this will go a long way in protecting lives and property in Nigeria. “It was an open bidding exercise, and I think I saw some of our local manufacturers participating, and the best and most responsive bids won the contract,” he clarified. On his part, Agba said the gathering also sanctioned three major contracts geared at enhancing the national grid for better power supply. He observed: “You will agree with me that of late we’ve had grid collapses, resulting in epileptic power supply in most parts of the country. There’s definitely been the need for us to reinvigorate our national grid to sustain and provide electricity to most citizens and communities.” Agba continued:  “One of the lines is the one linking Benin, Osogbo and Akure in Edo, Osun and Ondo states.” “The grid in that area has been weak for sometime, but with this approval of today’s (yesterday) contracts, we are swinging into action and certainly, very shortly, we would witness improvements. “Also, the 133 KVA in Akwanga and Lafia in Nasarawa State has been improved to strengthen the line to Abuja. Plateau and Benue states would witness better electricity supply following the strengthening.”
