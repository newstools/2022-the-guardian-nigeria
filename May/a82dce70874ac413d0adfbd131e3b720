There are tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies currently on the market and more are joining continuously. However, not all new projects succeed and are worth investing in. While presale tokens can be a great chance to get a lower price compared to established coins, research is essential prior to making any investment decision. A new crypto project Parody Coin (PARO) is attracting attention in the crypto community and is expected to do well once launched. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754705 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Parody-Coin-1-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Parody Coin (PARO) is focused on providing users with accessible and easy-to-use features of the NFT world and the Metaverse. The platform will enable minting, trading and purchasing of popular NFTs’ parodies of your choice. Innovators will benefit from the platform’s user-friendly interface.  The Parody Coin ecosystem is designed to combine the most advantageous features of the NFT market, in order to benefit the platform’s community. The project aims to address the issues of inaccessibility and high costs of participating in NFT minting and trading.  To encourage the platform’s growth and utilisation, Parody Coin will establish its own decentralised application (dApp) store where developers will be able to build and deploy apps. This is expected to support the development of Parody Coin’s NFT culture.  The Paroverse component of the Parody Coin ecosystem is designed to aid in the building of NFTs that interface with the real world, in order to meet the demands of Metaverse development. The Paroverse enables the creation and connection of digital settings that may be linked with the physical world, via NFT parodies and other dApps. At the moment, ApeCoin (APE) is the leading Metaverse token by market capitalisation. Despite being considerably new to the crypto world – launched in March 2022, it has overtaken popular projects like Decentraland (MANA) and The Sandbox (SAND).  The ApeCoin project was created by the Bored Ape Yacht Club and backed by the APE Ecosystem. APE, the governance and utility coin in the ecosystem, is used to facilitate and accelerate the development of Web 3.0. A key feature of the platform is its decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) architecture, which enables a community-driven administration system. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754706 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ApeCoin-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Bored Ape NFTs are among the popular NFTs that users will be able to build parodies of on the Parody Coin app. It is no secret that Bored Apes have sold for unbelievably high prices before, some reaching millions of dollars. The momentum was used by Yuga Labs to launch new applications and its own Metaverse. APE tokens were airdropped to Bored Apes holders and are now a native currency of the ApeCoin community members. Since its launch a couple of months ago, ApeCoin has received loads of attention from investors. Considering that ApeCoin’s success has been highly influenced by the Bored Apes NFTs, it is possible to suggest that Parody Coin is set to skyrocket. This is likely to happen once users are able to mint their own NFTs based on high-profile NFTs, such as Bored Apes.
