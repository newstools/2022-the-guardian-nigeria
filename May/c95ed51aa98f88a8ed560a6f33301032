A new yearly open championship will soon join the array of competitions in the Ibadan Golf Club’s (IGC) calendar. Courtesy of Mr. Abiodun Olatunji (SAN), who singlehandedly financed the club’s administrative building, said the new competition will draw players from across the country to IGC. Speaking during the commissioning of the administrative building, which was done by Governor of Oyo State, Olatunji said the competition, which would hold every December 29, would be known as Abiodun Olatunji Golf Open. He thanked members of the club for cooperating with him to ensure the timely completion of the building, while singling out Otunba Abimbola Davis, S.I Salami and Prince Bamidele Abolarin (Super Dee) for commendation for making the job easier for him. Olatunji, who canvassed maintenance of the club’s facilities to increase their lifespan, donated N2 million to be deposited in a special account strictly for the club’s maintenance. Other members, including Otunba Abimbola Davis, also donated sizable amounts towards this cause. Meanwhile, after two days of golfing, Sulaiman H. of IGC, who plays off handicap 11, emerged winner with 80 gross over 69net, just as Oyome Evelyn, also of IGC with six handicap, won the ladies category with 81 gross over 75 net on count back. The former captain of Tiger Golf Club, John Dongo, 11 handicapper, won best net in the Past & Present Captain cadre with 83 gross over 72net, while Mrs. Tope Alonge (handicap 26) won the ladies’ category of the same cadre with 106 gross over 80 net. Also at the event was the popular actress, Bimbo Osin-Ibironke, wife of the immediate past captain of the club, late Ola Ibironke, who could not hold back tears while thanking the members of the club, especially her late husband’s friends, for naming the newly constructed VIP lounge of the club after the late Ibironke.
