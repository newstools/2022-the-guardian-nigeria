Ifeamuma Nwafor-Orizu, the last son of Nigeria’s former senate president, Akweke Nwafor-Orizu, has warned against moves to destabilise the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra. The destabilisation plan, he contended, was aimed at shortchanging the number of PDP delegates in the May 28, 2022 convention of the party. The young Nwafor-Orizu, who spoke when he led a delegation from Nnewi North Local Council to a stakeholders meeting in Awka, the state capital, yesterday, pointed out that part of the plan was to sabotage the quest to produce a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction. He accused certain characters from the state of positioning themselves to be used as agents of destabilisation in the party, as well as the Igbo interest in the forthcoming presidential election, calling for unity of purpose and focus at this time. According to him, any plot to undermine the presence of authentic members of PDP in the forthcoming convention would spell doom for the party. He expressed worry that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party has deliberately refused to conduct the state congress after it had ratified the ward and local council congresses to enable the state produce its delegates to the convention. Nwafor-Orizu pointed out that the party might wield its big stick against agents of destabilisation in the party by sacking them from their wards to serve as deterrence. He spoke as aspirants of PDP stormed the party’s secretariat, Awka, over plans to reduce the number of delegates from the state to the convention, threatening to go to court to stop the convention.
