Bridge House College, at the weekend, defeated Multi-Plan Pathway College 4-0 in a friendly match played at the Pinefield School football pitch, Lekki, Lagos.
   
Bridge House College led by a lone goal in the first half, but they came out smoking in the second half, scoring three more goals to the admiration of their fans.
 
Speaking after the game, Bridge House College’s Head Coach, Adelekan Olugbenga, attributed his team’s victory to hard work, dedication, perseverance and teamwork. He said his school did not expect the wide goal margin because the opponents were usually a good side, adding: “We have young players everywhere, but these particular young stars did exceptionally well. “I can see a bright future for Nigerian football with our local players, who are growing fast.” Multi-Plan Pathway College’s Head Coach, Olisa Ofili, blamed his team’s poor outing on injury and some other factors that decimated their full squad. “The boys gave a good account of themselves, which was what I expected. I just wanted them to come and do exactly that, although the match did not go the way we wanted and the result looked very flattering to the opposing team. “We created many shots and couldn’t convert them, but our opponents were able to convert a good number of their chances. “Also, as the game went on, our players began to experience fatigue and that was when they were exposed for the opponents to score more goals,” he said.
