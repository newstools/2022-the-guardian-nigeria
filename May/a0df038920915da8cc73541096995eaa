The Game of Thrones star who is expecting her second child with husband Joe Jonas opened up for the first time about motherhood in an interview. “You know how you see your parents, as they get older, become way more sensitive? Like, ‘I’ve never seen my dad cry, and now I see him cry all the time.’ I feel like that.” She added, “The concept of family has made me a much more emotional person. The empathy is heightened; the feelings about family are just overflowing.” The 26-year-old continued “It’s made me a better actor for becoming a mother because the only way to become a really brilliant actor is to experience as much life as possible and to bring those experiences in.” The actress says that being able to experience life helps with better delivery of roles “This is just another little part of life that I’m experiencing that I get to bring in, and hopefully it helps my performance one way or another.” She once wrote on her Instagram that motherhood is, “ my favourite job I’ve ever had.” Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas got married in 2019 in a secret ceremony and had their baby girl Willa in July 2020.
