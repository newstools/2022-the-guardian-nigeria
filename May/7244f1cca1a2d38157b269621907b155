   The Chairman/Convener of the Forum of APC Governorship Aspirants, Chief Amos Gizo, made this known, yesterday, in a press briefing at the state APC secretariat. Gizo, a governorship aspirant, said that any attempt by Governor Simon Lalong or the party hierarchy to foist a candidate on the party and Plateau people would be vehemently resisted. Members of the forum include the Deputy Governor, Prof. Sonni Tyoden; Prof. Dakas Dakas, Sunday Biggs and Dr. Patrick Dakum. He stated categorically that the briefing was a collective agreement and position of the 18 governorship aspirants of APC in the state, adding that they were all passionate about the Plateau project, “all interested in changing the narrative for a new, secure and developed Plateau.” According to him, at the forum’s maiden meeting in April 2022, all the aspirants resolved that there should be no imposition of any kind, adding that, even consensus would be by the aspirants themselves. They also reportedly agreed that all would support any aspirant that becomes the consensus candidate. His words: “This press conference is necessitated by what looked like rumour but has been evident by the body language of the state governor, Lalong, and members of the first family. “We all believe that this act of subverting democracy has the express approval of the governor, just to drop the people’s choice and foist an unpopular candidate that will cause misfortune to the party as their preferred candidate.” He said that all the aspirants unanimously resolved to present to the party a consensus candidate, who could defeat other parties’ candidates.
