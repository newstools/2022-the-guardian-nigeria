Thrilled by the donation of a new administrative building by a member, Abiodun Olatunji, Ibadan Golf Club Captain, Tunji Oladosu, has commended the late captain of the club, Ola Ibironke, for the giant strides he made while leading the club. Oladosu, who stated that the new building would be commissioned next week, vowed to sustain Ibironke’s legacy. Speaking ahead of the programme lined up for the commissioning scheduled to hold from May 11 to 14, 2022, Oladosu said the project was initiated by the late Ibironke, popularly known as Dudu Heritage, adding that it is quite unfortunate that he is no more to witness the commissioning. “We are assuring you that we are keeping the good works that he had started and that is why we are going to honour him with this project; the VIP lounge will be named after his name, as a way of immortalising his good name and numerous good works for this great club,” said Oladosu. He enthused that “the structure could be ranked among the best in the golf clubs in Nigeria, with top-notch facilities, such as modernised bar, which is of international standard and a well equipped VIP lounge. “We also have a pro-shop now, where golfers’ materials will be displayed for sale.” Chairman of the building committee, Yomi Salami, said over 250 golfers are expected to participate in the golf competition designed as activities to mark the commissioning. He added that Governor Seyi Makinde, who is also a member of the club, is expected to cut the tape to commission the block. Salami did commend Olatunji for his efforts, saying he singlehandedly bankrolled the construction of the ultra-modern building. He described Olatunji as a jolly good fellow and a lover of golf, who spares nothing to support the game. Other members of the building committee that had worked in ensuring a memorable commissioning event are the club’s secretary, Mr. Seyi Alaba, Chief Yomi Layinka and Otunba Abimbola Davis.
