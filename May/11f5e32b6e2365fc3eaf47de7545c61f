There All Progressives Congress (APC) National Assembly aspirants, yesterday, urged the leadership of the party to conduct free, fair and transparent primary election. The three aspirants, Mr. Sunday Ola, Chief Segun Ajibulu and Dr. Olusegun Osinkolu, at a separate media briefings in Ado-Ekiti, insisted that the party owed them a duty to allow a level playing field. Ola, who is contesting for the House of Representatives seat, said that the delegates’ list might have been doctored to favour a particular aspirant, describing such development as unacceptable. RELATEDLY, Ajibulu, a contestant for the Ekiti North Senatorial seat, in a statement made available to newsmen in his Ipao-Ekiti country home, expressed hope that the most popular candidate would emerge through a free, fair, credible and acceptable election. ALSO, the former Director-General, Buhari/Osinbajo Campaign Council in Ekiti State, Osinkolu, advised delegates in the Ekiti North Senatorial District not to gamble with their votes and future in the senatorial primary. Osinkolu said the APC had found it difficult to get good representatives in the area owing to alleged imposition of candidates and poor decision by delegates. Osinkolu, who spoke in Ido and Otun-Ekiti, headquarters of Ido/Osi and Moba local councils, while interacting with the delegates in pursuit of his senatorial ambition, urged the 280 delegates to apply their votes wisely in the primary to prevent future regret as being presently witnessed. He said: “I am ready for the primary. I have been in contact with the 280 delegates and I am confident of winning. This is my fourth attempt and I have developed good rapport with my people here. “Let me tell you that you should not be afraid of anyone. This is a secret ballot system and you must vote your conscience so that you won’t regret later.”
