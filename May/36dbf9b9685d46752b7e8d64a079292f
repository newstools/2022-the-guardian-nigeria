Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki; Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and a chieftain of All Progressives Congress  (APC) in Rivers State, Dakuku Peterside have congratulated Nigeria’s former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, on his victory at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential primary election.
 
In his message, Obaseki hailed other aspirants who submitted themselves to transparent democratic exercise that, according to him, has set the PDP as a worthy example to all other political parties in the country.
 
He said: “I heartily congratulate His Excellency, Atiku Abubakar (GCON) on his victory at the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential primary election.”  The governor urged him, as the face of the PDP in general elections, to bring his political and socio-economic wherewithal to bear on the responsibility of charging all aspirants who participated in all the party’s primary elections across the country, including the presidential, as well as leaders of the party to close ranks and work for its victory in the general elections. PETERSIDE, in a statement, yesterday, said the outcome of the PDP presidential primary was a proof that Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, was only a ‘local champion’ who lacked the requisite experience to compete in national politics, alleging that despite spending nothing less than N30b of Rivers’ funds, PDP delegates still rejected him. He said: “Wike has shown lack of requisite experience and depth to compete in national politics.” The former Director General, Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) added: “I suggest that Wike quickly returns home, put off his toga of pride, and submit himself to Atiku to be tutored on the dynamics of national politics and the angles to hi-wire deals.” Peterside advised Wike to come back home and begin to prepare for PDP’s presidential primary to hold in 2031. “Let Wike return home and begin early preparations for PDP’s presidential primary to hold in 2031, which might hold at the Rumueprikom Playground.”
