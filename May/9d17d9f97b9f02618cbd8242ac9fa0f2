The All Progressives Congress (APC) is carefully making efforts to present the best candidate from the array of aspirants that have shown interest in the country’s presidency. The National Chairman of APC, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, disclosed this at the sixth yearly conference and award ceremony of the Presidential Diary Magazine, in Abuja. Represented by the National Publicity Secretary, Felix Muoka, the chairman said the party was proud to have many competent hands willing to lead the nation after President Muhammadu Buhari. “It is our constitutional and statutory obligation to present our candidates. So, we are just making sure that we have the right people at all levels,” he said. “The Electoral Act makes provision for the direct, indirect and the consensus (primary election) models. So, political parties are free to adopt anyone of those models in the election of those who will fly their flag in the general election. “We have opted for the indirect model, which is why we have gone ahead and in the past week to elect the right delegates. “Some sections perceived this as a spy on the opposition. We are making efforts and the opposition is trying their best as well.” Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to the President, Mr. Femi Adesina, urged Nigerians to believe in the current administration, even as it has few months to leave office. “The President will not rest on his oars to ensure the citizens enjoy the dividends of democracy. We will ensure that all Nigerians experience the best in all their endeavours,” Adesina said. In his address, the Chairman and Editorial Adviser of the Presidential Diary Magazine, Dr. Abubakar Jimoh, said the organisation would continue to uphold the tenets of the media by promoting good governance, and ensuring that governments at all levels were held accountable, especially to their campaign promises.
