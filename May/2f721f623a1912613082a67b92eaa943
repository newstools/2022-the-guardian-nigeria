The Office of the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have announced a new set of UN targets for universal and meaningful digital connectivity to be achieved by 2030.
  
The 15 aspirational targets, developed as part of the work of the UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation Roundtable Group on Global Connectivity, co-chaired by ITU and UNICEF, prioritize universality, technology and affordability to ensure that everyone can fully benefit from connectivity. The Roadmap had called for establishing a connectivity baseline and targets to aid in advancing a safer, more equitable digital world and a brighter and more prosperous future for all.
   
ITU Secretary-General, Houlin Zhao, said the universal connectivity alone is not enough to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and ensure that every person has safe and affordable access to the Internet by 2030,” said. “These targets will help countries guide their efforts towards effectively ensuring we meet our goal of universal and meaningful connectivity by the end of the decade.”
  
Zhao said universal and meaningful connectivity is the possibility for everyone to enjoy a safe, satisfying, enriching, productive and affordable online experience.  “Meaningful connectivity is key to achieve digital transformation,” said Doreen Bogdan-Martin, Director of ITU’s Telecommunication Development Bureau. “Among today’s estimated 4.9 billion Internet users, many have to limit their usage because connectivity is unreliable, too slow or too expensive; they share a device; or a lack of digital skills prevent them from getting the most out of their devices and services. ITU is committed to working with all relevant stakeholders, through all connectivity efforts including our Giga initiative in partnership with UNICEF to connect every school to the Internet, and leveraging our newly launched Partner2Connect Digital Coalition, to ensure that these targets are not just aspirational, but achievable.”
