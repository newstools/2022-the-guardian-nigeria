The management of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, has directed members of staff and students of the institution to resume Thursday, May 26, 2022. This was contained in a statement made available to journalists yesterday by the Registrar, Kayode Ogunleye. The resumption is for the continuation of the academic activities for the first semester of the 2021/2022 Academic Session. The statement reads: “Upon the directive of the Visitor to the university, the management hereby informs all members of staff and students that the university will continue its academic activities for the first semester of the 2021/2022 academic session on Thursday, May 26, 2022. “The amended academic calendar for the semester will soon be made available. “Members of staff and students are hereby enjoined to abide by this directive. “On behalf of the Acting Vice Chancellor, Prof. M. O. Liasu, I welcome all students back to the campus and wish them a crisis-free semester.” The Ibadan Zone of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in Ogbomoso had on Wednesday said that LAUTECH remained steadfast and would not pull out of the ongoing strike declared by the national body of the academic union. The union said that LAUTECH ASUU believes in the long-term benefit of repositioning public universities and not driven by primordial sentiments being dished out in some quarters. Co-ordinator of the zone, Prof. Oyebamiji Oyegoke, while addressing a press conference, stated that the current infrastructure face-lift, which LAUTECH enjoys and TETFUND grants, which its members of staff enjoy, were products of ASUU’s struggle without which the institution will not be able to have a semblance of a university. However, the withdrawal is coming after calls by the Students Union Government (SUG)  that the union should withdraw like some other state universities.
