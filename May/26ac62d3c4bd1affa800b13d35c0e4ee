The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has said that the reforms undertaken by the Seventh National Action Plan (NAP 7.0) are geared toward enhancing Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings as stated in the Agro-Export Plan. PEBEC Secretary and Special Adviser to the President on Ease of Doing Business, Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, disclosed this yesterday in a statement to update the country on the completion of NAP 7.0. He said the reforms in the plan, which include the streamlining and simplification of ago-export regulatory practices, have the capacity of boosting the competitiveness of Nigeria’s agro-exports. According to Oduwole, NAP 7.0 is designed to reduce the challenges faced by micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across four areas – Agro-Export Implementation Action Plan, automation reforms, regulatory reforms and Executive Order 01/ReportGov.NG compliance reforms. She stated that the PEBEC Secretariat would continue to work with MDAs to deliver the outstanding reforms for the benefit of MSMEs and the Nigerian economy. She said: “The completed reforms for the NAP 7.0 include the publication of insolvency regulations pursuant to the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 and providing the much-needed support for the operationalisation of the extensive insolvency provisions in CAMA 2020. In addition, public companies will now be able to upload their share registers on CAC’s Company Registration Portal (CRP).”
