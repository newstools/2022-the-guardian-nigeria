The governorship elections in Delta State are certainly between the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC). It has always been a crowded primary election in the PDP, and this year is no different.  DEPUTY Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege is certain to pick the APC ticket whenever the coronation in form of a primary is held. In short, he inches closer to the vehicle by the day, as there is no other aspirant that can match him.
 
Indeed, he may be looking beyond the primary election already, with the focus now on next year’s battle with whoever eventually emerges from PDP’s crowded race. He has been making inroads in Delta North with the support of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, who represents the district in the National Assembly.
 
Nwaoboshi dumped the PDP last year to join Omo-Agege in APC when it was thought that the governor was going to seek a return to the senate. But with Okowa announcing that he would not be returning to the senate, Nwaoboshi sees his chances being brighter, even though many believe he is likely to run with Omo-Agege as deputy.
 
On the surface, APC now controls two (Delta Central and Delta North) out of the three senatorial districts of the state, which, if taken as a yardstick in deciding the outcome of the general elections, could be in its favour.  In all, the few remaining days to the parties’ primaries remain very crucial, and it would not be unusual to see some aspirants step down for others after horse-trading, climb down or even switch platforms if it becomes clearer where the race is headed.
