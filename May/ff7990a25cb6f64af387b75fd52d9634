A Nigerian policeman Corporal Matthew Isaac has been arrested after a video of him singing and dancing to a song that praises a cult group went viral. Isaac currently serves in Ebonyi State. He was seen in the video fully dressed in his uniform, singing, dancing and brandishing his service rifle while the song played in the background. Policeman spokesman Muyiwa Adejobi said Isaac’s act contravened the ethics of the Nigerian police. “The act of the officer in question, which is clearly calculated to portray the NPF negatively, is a discreditable conduct in line with the provisions of the First Schedule to Regulation 370 of the Police Regulations,” Adejobi said in a statement. Adejobi said Isaac also violated the provisions of the NPF Social Media Policy (SMP), penal laws, and other extant laws regulating the conduct and discipline of all Police officers. “The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has directed the Commissioner of Police in charge of Ebonyi State to detail the Command’s OC Provost to hand over the erring officer to the Force Provost Marshall for necessary disciplinary actions,” the police spokesman said.
