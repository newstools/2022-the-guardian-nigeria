Sokoto State Governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Aminu Tambuwal, has said that any aspirant that wants to continue with President Muhammadu Buhari’s woeful performance should be rejected. Addressing PDP delegates in Lokoja, yesterday, ahead of the party’s primaries, Tambuwal said: “We are living witnesses to the pathetic security situation in the country, which has become a national problem. Yet some people say they want to continue with what Buhari is doing. Please, don’t give such people any chance.” He also urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the face of the current security challenges, as he would change the narrative.
