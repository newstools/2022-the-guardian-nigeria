The Northern Governors Forum has called for calm following the killing of Miss Deborah Samuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, alleged of blasphemy. The chairman of the forum and governor of Plateau, Mr Simon Lalong, made the appeal in a statement conveyed by his spokesperson, Dr Makut Macham in Jos. “The governors are concerned about the development which is clearly an extra-judicial measure of addressing perceived infraction. “The northern governors appeal for calm following reports of the hijack of a peaceful protest which later turned violent and led to the imposition of a curfew in Sokoto metropolis,”. The governors noted that any attempt to adopt self-help in addressing grievances whether religious or otherwise, could lead to further chaos. The forum commiserated with the family of the victim and appealed that security agencies be allowed to thoroughly investigate the matter. It also commiserated with Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State over the incident, while commending the proactive measures he adopted to restore normalcy. The governors assured him of their solidarity and prayers in dealing with the matter, noting that they would ensure the adoption of necessary measures to forestall recurrence in any part of the region and nation at large. The forum also stressed the need for people from the northern part of the country and Nigerians to show love, tolerance and respect for one another irrespective of faith, ethnicity or other affiliations.
