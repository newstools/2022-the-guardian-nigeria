The Delta State Football Association (DFA), yesterday, unveiled its 2022 FA Cup programme ahead of the commencement of the tournament sponsored by Asaba Airport Company. DFA Chairman, Kenneth Nwamucha, at the unveiling ceremony in Asaba, described the sponsor as a good omen for the state, DFA and the participating teams. Nwamucha, while assuring the participating teams of a hitchfree tournament, thanked football administrators, club owners and their representatives for their commitment and understanding so far. He said the best team in the tournament in the men’s category would get a cash price of N800, 000, while the second best team gets N400, 000. He also disclosed that the best team in the women category would get N500,000 while the second best gets N300,000. “Since our past chairman, now the NFF President, Mr. Amaju Pinnick, left Delta State to face national football, we have not had any sponsor. A few months ago, with the approval of my board members, we have been able to get this done. “I am happy that I have a very hard-working and dedicated team as board members and that is why we are having the good results. We argue to get the best, we don’t argue to separate ourselves,” he said. Nwamucha thanked the state sports writers association (SWAN) for their support, saying they are part of the achievements the DFA has recorded so far. Also speaking on the competition, representative of Asaba Airport Company, Umeh Umeh, affirmed: “We want to be part of the partnership and we will be part of it till the end of the programme and even beyond.”
