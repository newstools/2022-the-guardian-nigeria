In the show’s latest episode, Kim, her daughter North and KKW Beauty chief marketing officer Tracy Romulus and her kids, Remi and Ryan, walked out of the restaurant to look at the results of Kim’s test. The Kardashian, who had previously failed the First-Year Law Students’ Examination three times, explained, “I go in the car because if I’m upset, I don’t want to have everyone stare.” “You are only allowed to take the baby bar a certain amount of times. This was the last time I could ever take it, so if I don’t [pass], then this law school journey is over for me.” In this episode, viewers also watched as Kim Kardashian finds out about her success after a dramatic moment of waiting for the screen to load and her yelling, “I passed!” The mom of four revealed her location while FaceTiming her professor Chuck Shonholtz. “I’m at Red Lobster! North won her first basketball game ever and we came to Red Lobster and I’m in the car.” The tv star then walked back into the restaurant with North, who urged her to “call dad (Kanye West) now.” Before the show’s episode, fans had first learnt of Kim’s success at the baby bar in a post on Instagram. “OMFGGGG I PASSED THE BABY BAR EXAM!!!!” she captioned a series of photos of herself at the time. “For anyone who doesn’t know my law school journey, know this wasn’t easy or handed to me,” she continued. “I failed this exam 3 times in 2 years, but I got back up each time and studied harder and tried again until I did it!!! (I did have COVID on the 3rd try w a 104 fever but I’m not making excuses)” “Bottom line is don’t ever give up even when you are holding on by a thread, you can do it!!!!! Set your mind to it and get it done because it feels soooooo good once you get to the other side!”
