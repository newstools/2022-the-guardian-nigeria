The Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Most Rev Mathew Hassan Kukah, has announced the suspension of masses in the state after two parishes were attacked by a mob on Saturday. Kukah said masses will not hold until the curfew declared by Governor Aminu Tambuwal is lifted. The Sokoto State government declared a curfew on Saturday following the violent protest that erupted by some Muslims demanding the release of those arrested by the Police in connection with the gruesome murder and burning of Deborah Samuel for alleged blasphemy. He also confirmed the destruction at the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral, where the glass windows were shattered, and at Bishop Lawton Secretariat where a community bus parked within the premises was vandalized. According to reports, a team of anti-riot policemen drafted to the scene were able to disperse the protesters to avert further damage. “They were promptly dispersed by a team of mobile policemen before they could do further damage,” the statement noted. “The hoodlums also attacked the Bakhita Centre located along Aliyu Jodi road and burnt down a bus within the premises.” Kukah commended the state government and security forces for their prompt action in curbing the violent activities of the protesters.
