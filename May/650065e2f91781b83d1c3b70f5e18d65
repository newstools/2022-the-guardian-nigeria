A student of The Polytechnic Ibadan, on Monday reportedly died after having sex with his partner, identified as Aramide. Aramide is reported to be in a coma. The Guardian learnt that the deceased, identified as Oromidayo, a National Diploma II student in the Civil Engineering department and Aramide who is a National Diploma II, Department of Business Administration, allegedly took sex-enhancing drugs. A neighbour said she was horrified when she saw the deceased lifeless body on the floor and the Aramide barely alive before being rushed to University College Hospital (UCH). “We are supposed to start our examinations yesterday before the school was closed down due to protest,” the source said. “We were asked to go back home. We all did. When they got home, they drugged themselves and started having sex which lead to the death of Oromidayo.” All efforts to reach the Public Relations Officer, Polytechnic Ibadan, Adewole Soladoye, for comments proved abortive.
