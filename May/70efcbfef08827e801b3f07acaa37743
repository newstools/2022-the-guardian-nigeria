Winners at the 10-kilometre Okpekpe Road Race, which holds this weekend, will share from a total prize purse of over N60 million, the organisers have said. The eighth edition will hold on Saturday in Okpekpe near Auchi in Edo State. The prize money outlay published in www.okpekperoadrace.com shows that a total of $103,000 is on offer as prize money to the top eight finishers in the men and women’s elite race, with the winner in each gender category going home with $20, 000, while $13, 000, $9, 000, $6, 500 and $3,000 respectively will go to the second, third, fourth and fifth placed finishers.
 
The organisers also announced an unchanged prize money outlay for Nigerian runners at the race. The first placed finishers in both the men and women race will go home with N1 million, while the second to the fifth placed finishers will get N600, 000, N400, 000, N250, 000 and N150, 000 respectively. “The prize money on offer at the Okpekpe Race is clearly more than the minimum gross guaranteed prize money specified in World Athletics’ road race regulations,” said Race Director, Zack Amodu. He revealed that payment of prize money and bonuses is dependent upon athletes clearing the usual anti-doping procedures, adding, “athletes running for the prize money on offer must also achieve a level of performance before they can redeem their respective prizes. “For example, to qualify for the $20, 000 top prize for the elite runners, the athletes must run 28:35.00 minutes or better for the men and 32:41.00 minutes for the women.” “For the Nigerian category, the winners must run 29:04.00 minutes or better for men and 34:05.01 minutes for the women’s race.”
 Amodu also revealed that only the top five finishers would benefit from the prize money on offer unlike in previous editions where the top eight finishers were captured.
