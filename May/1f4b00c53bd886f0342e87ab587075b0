Pedestrians and residents of the Ojodu-Berger area of Lagos State were yesterday, thrown into fear, following the killing of the chairman of the Ojodu-Berger Okada Riders Association, Mr. Alaba Williams also known as ‘Onimama’. Many of the residents could not access the popular Kosoko bus stop in the area, where the death of the chairman allegedly occurred, for fear of attack. The area, which used to be a beehive of activities with pedestrians transiting from one location to the other, suddenly became a shadow of itself as many Okada riders fled the area for fear of arrest by the police. The Guardian gathered that Williams was stabbed to death in the early hours of yesterday, following an argument between him (Williams) and a fellow Okada man, while he was allegedly demanding a settlement fee for dropping a passenger at the bus stop. A resident of the area, Mr. Rasheed said: “The chairman was allegedly stabbed by ‘one of the area boys’ in the neck during an argument over money. I learned that before they could rush him to the hospital, he passed out. The man alleged to have stabbed him was beaten severely and his leg broken before he was rescued by the police.” MEANWHILE, operatives of the Lagos State police have been deployed to the area to restore sanity.
