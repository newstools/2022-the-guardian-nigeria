 pete-davidson | billboard SNL comedian Pete Davidson joked about dealing with Kanye West in his stand-up gig as part of the Netflix Is A Joke Fest.   Kim Kardashian’s new beau addressed West’s multiple claims targeted at him. Addressing West’s claims that he (Pete Davidson) had AIDS, Davidson said, “I had an AIDS scare this year.” But after a doctor’s visit it turned out that he only looked like he had Aids. He continued, “Does anybody else secretly hope that Kanye showed up as Mrs Doubtfire? I would come home and someone would be like, this is the new housekeeper and He’d be like, What up Fam!?” Noting people’s reactions to him since West’s targeted claims, Davidson elaborated by saying that when he meets people, it always goes 50/50, that they either say, “Hey man, you’re really cool, or they say Hey yo, f-k you!” Back in March, Ye took his disdain for Davidson to a new level by releasing a music video for Eazy, which showed the rapper holding a bloodied, disfigured head created to look like Davidson. “People try to give you advice, but even friends that are older, they’re like ‘I don’t know. It looks pretty bad, bro. Sorry, good luck. (We’re) here if you need, but like, no advice,'” Davidson said. “No one was like, ‘this is what you do.’ Everyone’s like, ‘oh, yeah. You staying with your mom? You in a safe spot?'” Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian started dating after the reality TV star’s SNL hosting debut back in October. The two recently made an appearance at the 2022 Met Gala.
