…Index crosses 51,000 mark to hit 13-year high Despite uncertainty in the global economy, Nigeria’s stock market is currently having a solid start in the month of May, with investors increasing their bets on blue-chip companies in anticipation of continued expansion in profits, as investors gained N521 billion while the index hit the 51,000 mark. Precisely, at the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index rose by 967.45 absolute points, representing an increase of 1.90 per cent  to close at 51,902.48 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value gained N521 billion to close at N27.981 trillion. Notwithstanding the global crisis and inflation, the Nigerian stock market has continued in an upbeat since the beginning of the year, emerging the best performing market in Africa and third in the world, as the NGX’s All Share Index (ASI) hit 13-year high, crossing the 51,000 mark for the first time since 2008. The market’s performance was driven by gains in MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN). In addition, Presco, Nigerian Breweries, Conoil and Cadbury Nigeria contributed to the strong close. Reacting to the development, analysts at Coronation Research attributed the upturn to low short-term market yields in the fixed income market while adding that investors’ participation in risk assets has been encouraging. “Though the market was flat in February and early March, better-than-expected FY 2021 earnings, positive earnings expectations for Q1 2022, corporate actions, and investors taking positions ahead of FY 2021 dividend payments continued to support the market. “Going into Q2, we expect the impact of market interest rate increases to be delayed. This may give breathing room for the market, particularly for stocks continuing to show top-line growth, steady margins and earnings growth.
