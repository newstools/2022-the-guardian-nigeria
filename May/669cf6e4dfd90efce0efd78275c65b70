The PEARL Awards Nigeria has announced that the 25th edition of the award will hold later in the year. To this end, the Central Working Committee (CWC) of the 2022 PEARL Awards has been inaugurated. According to the President, PEARL Awards, Tayo Orekoya, the inauguration kick-started the official process and activities that culminate in the hosting of the awards on the last Sunday of November every year. Orekoya said the 2022 PEARL Awards, with the theme ‘Sustaining Excellence through Tenacity’, reflects the current realities of corporates and capital markets, locally and globally. Orekoya stated: “On behalf of the Board of Governors and Secretariat of the PEARL Awards Project, I have the singular honour and privilege of welcoming you all to this call to selfless service and we look forward to your dedication and commitment as we set out for the onerous task ahead.” It would be recalled that the Awards were put off in 2020 and 2021 due to the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses. Orekoya, therefore, reiterated that the organisers are “therefore faced with the herculean task of bringing back the awards fully to the corporate space of Nigeria after two years of inactivity. “The yearnings of our stakeholders for the Pearl Awards to return cannot be over-emphasised and therefore we must do everything possible to ensure that this year’s Awards surpasses their expectations.”
