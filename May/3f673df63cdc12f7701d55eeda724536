 Kate Middleton in Chanel Tweed Suit Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, has spoken up about motherhood and mental health. The 40-year old addresses this in a video footage as she assumes her new function as patron of Maternal Mental Health Alliance. The patronage was confirmed during Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week, which finishes up on Sunday. In the video footage, the duchess said it’s about ‘power and importance of connection’ going further to say the past two years made people understand the role of relationships and in the long run health and happiness, particularly at the beginning of life for newborns. The Duchess of Cambridge said it was important for people “struggling” to be given the “right support at the right time” and also advised society to play its part, saying everyone needed to assist “parents and carers, and those who are raising children today”. Since her royal ring, Kate, who has three kids, has concentrated for years on support of mental health.
