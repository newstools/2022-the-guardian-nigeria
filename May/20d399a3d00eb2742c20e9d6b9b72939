*As Oluwo, Mustapha stay away The Chairman, Lagos All Progressives Congress Electoral Committee, Mr Adamu Shettima Yuguda, has said that the two governorship aspirants who picked a form to contest in Lagos were not on the ballot paper because they were not cleared by the screening and appeals committee of the party. He provided this insight at the ongoing Lagos governorship primary election at Mobolaji Johnson Stadium, Onikan. There had been a rumour that the two governorship aspirants vying for the party’s ticket, Wale Oluwo and Olorunfemi Mustapha, were barred from the venue of the primary. But Yuguda maintained that because they were not cleared, they had no reason to be on the ballot and to be present at the venue of the primary.
