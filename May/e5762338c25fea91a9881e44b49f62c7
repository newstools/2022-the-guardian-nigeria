She shared the news in an announcement on her Instagram on Tuesday. Sharing a photo of herself and her husband, she wrote “A Princely Arrival With thanksgiving and gratitude to our Heavenly Father, we are delighted to share with you the announcement of the birth of our second son whose arrival has immersed us with unspeakable joy.” “Indeed, the Lord has blessed us beyond measure and our hearts are filled with eternal gratitude. Glory be to His name. Stephanie & Linus.” The couple tied the knot in 2012, shortly after Stephanie’s marriage to Super Eagles player Chikelue Iloenyosi was annulled. The couple got married in a private ceremony in France and recently celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary. In 2015, they welcomed their first child.
