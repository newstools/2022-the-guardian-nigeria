Some officers of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) have reportedly petitioned Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over alleged non-promotion in the last 12 years. The petitioners, who claimed to have been enlisted in 2011, said they got direct appointments to Narcotic Agent rank (Level 5) in the second cadre of the agency’s ranking structure on July 1, 2011, having fulfilled all requirements captured in NDLEA’s conditions of service, Chapter 2, Number 10. The officers, in a petition dated April 30, 2022, called for the intervention of the minister to prevail on the leadership of the agency to promote them. The aggrieved personnel claimed that three promotion exercises had been undertaken, insisting that they were deliberately excluded. The petition reads in part: “The efficacy of this is that our immediate juniors are now our mates, while our immediate seniors are two ranks above us, making us lose seniority and (become) objects of caricature in our working environment all over Nigeria.”
