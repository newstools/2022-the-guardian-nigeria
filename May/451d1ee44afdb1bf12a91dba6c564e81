An Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court on Friday remanded two men in a correctional centre for allegedly being in possession of a human head, exhuming and cutting off head of a six-year-old boy. The defendants, Lukuman Kusimo, 55, and Oluwaseyi Olojede, 59, were arraigned on a two count- charge of unlawful possession of human head,  exhuming and cutting off head of a six -year- boy. The Magistrate, Mrs Olajumoke Somefun, who did not take the plea of the defendants, deferred their bail and ordered that they be remanded at the Oba Correctional Centre. Somefun, however, adjourned the case until June 29 for further hearing. Earlier, the Prosecutor, ASP Olakunle Shonibare, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on April 26 at Lantoro area in Abeokuta. Shonibare said the defendants conspired among themselves to exhume the body of Samuel Adeniyi and cut off his head for ritual purpose. “Upon investigation, it was gathered that the first defendant, Kusimo, is a Mortuary attendant, who assisted the parent of Samuel in burying Samuel’s remains at Oke- Yidi Lantoro cemetery in Abeokuta on April 25. “On April 26 in the early hours, Kusimo went back to the grave, exhumed the body and cut off the head of Samuel`s remains. ” Luck ran out of him when the Ogun State So-Safe Corps  on routine patrol sighted him with a sack and accosted him and found the head of the six- year old boy with him,“he  said. He said that Kusimo’s arrest led to the arrest of the second defendant Olojede, who had requested to buy human head. Shonibare said the offence contravened Sections 516, 329 (A)(1)of the Criminal Code Laws of Ogun, 2006.
