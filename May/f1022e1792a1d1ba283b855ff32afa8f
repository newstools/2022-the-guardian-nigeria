 Penelope and Colin Photo The Mary Sue Bridgerton lovers will watch the love story between Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton unfold in the show’s third season.   The new plot for season three takes a different turn from the book series. The book’s third novel focuses on Benedict Bridgerton and the surprising love he finds. The film’s new plot was confirmed by Penelope actress Nicola Coughlan who shared a photo of her posing with Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton) on her Instagram account. The caption read, “Like Lady Whistledown I’ve been keeping quite a big secret for quite a long time… but I can finally tell you that @bridgertonnetflix Season Three is Colin and Penelope’s Story.”   A post shared by Nicola Coughlan (@nicolacoughlan) New showrunner Jess Brownell said to Variety, “I really feel like it’s Colin and Penelope’s time.” “I feel like, especially in the last season, there are these moments of tension between them where it’s like, Colin walks up to the line of almost realizing that Penelope has feelings for him but doesn’t quite get there.” “Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.” Bridgerton season two, which was released in March, followed Anthony Bridgerton’s (Jonathon Bailey) love story with Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley). The show was an instant hit after season one, which had followed the romance between Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) and Simon Basset (Regé-Jean Page), earning the top spot as Netflix’s most-watched film a month after its release.
