The group led by Mike Ejiogu in a press conference held in Owerri, yesterday, insisted that, “zoning arrangement for all elective positions in the area would guarantee peace, progress and even development of the area.” The group condemned the attitudes of some leaders from the zone, who according to it, were working to jeopardize the peace and mutual understanding existing between the people of Okigwe North and South, the two constituencies that made up the zone. Ejiogu and other leaders at the press briefing, including Ben Duru and Dr. Pope Ekweh, said the group was out to resist the attempt to impose candidates in the poll against the overall wishes and aspirations of the people of zone in the forthcoming elections. “We unequivocally insist that the position of the senator representing Okigwe Zone should go to Okigwe North in 2023 for equity and fairness,” the group said. “Okigwe South has occupied the senate position for an interrupted period of fifteen years and currently occupies the positions of a Senator, Minister and Secretary to the state government, SSG. “We, therefore, call on all the political parties to field their candidates for the Imo North senatorial seat for the 2023 general election from Okigwe North.” It continued, “we condemn the present tendency of some political players in the zone to disrupt the existing peace and harmony in the zone through clandestine moves to thwart the wishes and aspirations of the people of the zone’s equity and fair play. “Finally, we want to seize this opportunity to warn against any outside interference from outside the zone. This time around, the good people of Okigwe zone should be allowed to chart their own cause and determine their collective destiny.” Adding his voice, Duru said, “we are by this briefing calling for the charter of equity in the political system of Okigwe zone. We are going to meet with all leaders in the zone to make sure that this agitation scale through.”
