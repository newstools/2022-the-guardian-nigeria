The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Lagos State Branch, has solicited the support of the banking community, as it begins the construction of the Lagos Bankers’ House. The Chairman of the branch, Peter Ashade, said this ahead of the groundbreaking ceremony of the Lagos Bankers’ House, held today, said the institute would partner with banks to accommodate their brands when the edifice is completed. He described the groundbreaking ceremony as a significant milestone in the history of the institute as Lagos happens to be the flagship branch of the institute. According to him, the journey to achieving the laudable vision with the support of the national secretariat has given the institute a lot of hope as the edifice would be commissioned in due time. Ashade also said the location is also strategic as completing the property would give the institute better visibility. Earlier, Building Committee Chairman, Kola Abdul, said the building, which would be completed in a reasonable time, would advance the institute’s cause as a professional body. He said each floor would accommodate ATM galleries of all the banks, training, meeting and examination centres for bankers and a penthouse.
