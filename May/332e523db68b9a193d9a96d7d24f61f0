• Competition begins May 31 with 24 schools
President of the Nigeria Volleyball Federation, Musa Nimrod, has again showed his passion for the development of sports in the country by donating trophies and medals for the volleyball event of the sixth Lagos Inter-Schools Sports Fiesta, which will begin on May 31. Speaking during the presentation of items to the organisers, Nimrod commended them for taking volleyball to schools, adding that sports development must start from the grassroots. “For volleyball to grow, we need to focus more on grassroots and our schools is the best place to start. We, at the federation, are ready to support volleyball at grassroots level because this will help us discover future players, who will replace the ageing ones. “We are happy with what Wonderland Sports is doing and you can see that it is a programme we should all support, especially since this programmme is endorsed by Lagos State government through the Sports Commission,” he said. The Volleyball Federation president charged other sports federations and corporate bodies to support Wonderland Sports’ efforts to unearth young talents from the grassroots. Earlier, coordinator of the fiesta, Tayo Adeyemo, said the competition, which is in its sixth season, will commence on May 31 at various schools and centres in Lagos, with the grand finale billed for Agege Stadium. He listed the events for season six as football, volleyball, athletics, basketball, table tennis and tug of war, adding that over 24 schools are expected to participate in the fiesta with winners going home with trophies, medals and other gift items.
