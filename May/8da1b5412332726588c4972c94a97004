The Christian Association of Nigerian (CAN) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration to seek help from other countries to overcome the security snag besetting the country. It also said that most of those jostling to be president in 2023 in the All Progressives Congress (APC) had no ideas of what they would do differently to move the country forward. Oyo State Chairman of CAN, Apostle Joshua Akinyemi, stated these during an exclusive interview with The Guardian in Ibadan at the weekend. Akinyemi, who decried the current insecurity in the country, said it looked like the Federal Government and security forces were overwhelmed. He said those campaigning to be president, especially on the platform of the APC, had not told Nigerians the new ideas they want to bring to the table, adding that they are all part of the current administration.
