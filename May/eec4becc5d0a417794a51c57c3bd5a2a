Barely few days to the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), a group has set up a grassroots-based crowdfunding portal to aid Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s bid to become the party’s flag bearer. The portal, Pyoglobalpartners.com, was launched by the group, which goes by the name PYO Global Partners. According to a statement signed on its behalf by Mrs. Temi Okesanjo, the campaign-financing move is to ensure the emergence of a president who would not perceive himself as a lord or ruler in office. MEANWHILE, Osinbajo has concluded his interactive sessions with stakeholders and APC delegates in all the 36 states and the FCT, Abuja. Osinbajo, whose last visits were to Benue and Lagos States on Wednesday, had declared his intention to contest the 2023 presidential election on the APC platform on Monday, April 11, in a televised and online broadcast, which went viral on traditional, digital and social media platforms, with scores of millions at home and abroad welcoming his presidential declaration. “I believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and its great people,” Osinbajo had stated in his speech. A statement issued by his spokesman, Laolu Akande, yesterday, recalled that the Vice President began the interactive sessions with delegates in Ibadan, Oyo State, on Friday, April 22. It noted that at every interaction with stakeholders and delegates from the 36 states and the FCT, Osinbajo had robust question-and-answer sessions while also discussing and exchanging ideas.
