Nigeria Customs Services men and women volleyball teams will fly the nation’s flag in this year’s African Clubs Volleyball Championships in Tunis, Tunisia.
While the men’s team is already in Tunis for the championships holding from May 5 to 18, the women’s volleyball squad is expected to depart next week for their competition slated for May 19 to June 1, 2022, also in Tunis. An official of the Nigeria Customs Services, former Nigerian track and field star, Samuel Onikeku, told The Guardian that he is optimistic the two teams will do the nation proud having prepared well for the championship. Onikeku, who is the current Technical Director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), revealed that the Nigeria Customs Services had been attending the African Clubs Championships for four straight years. “We have not missed any edition of the African Clubs Championships in the last four years,” Onikeku said. “Our women team even got to the semifinals last year and I am optimistic we will do better this year.” According to him, the men’s team to Tunisia is made up of 14 players and six officials. “The Nigeria Customs Service Women Volleyball team will also be represented by the same number of players and officials. As soon as the African Clubs Championships for the men is over, I will return to take the women team to Tunisia.”
