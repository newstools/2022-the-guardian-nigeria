Real name, Sergio Giavonni Kitchens, Gunna is being charged with a single count of conspiracy to violate the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in the 56-count state indictment, which is aimed at alleged members of the Young Slime Life gang — which is similar to the name of Young Thug’s independent label, Young Stoner Life. The RICO indictment against the YSL includes 26 defendants affiliated with the gang and charges them with 56 counts related to gang activity and racketeering. The charges also include murder, drug and gun possession, witness intimidation, carjacking, robbery, theft and drug dealing. Gunna is alleged to have committed felonies, including receiving stolen property and drug possession with intent to distribute. “As the district attorney of Fulton County, my No. 1 focus is targeting gangs,” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis said at a news conference on Tuesday. “And there’s a reason for that. They are committing, conservatively, 75 to 80% of all of the violent crime that we are seeing within our community.” Gunna was one of the first musicians to sign with the YSL Records label, which has since grown into a key player in Atlanta’s hip-hop industry. DS4Ever, his third album, debuted at the top of the Billboard albums list. Last month, he performed as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live and attended the Met Gala in New York City.
