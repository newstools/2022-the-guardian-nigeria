Arteta has told his Arsenal players that “tomorrow is the day” to achieve their target of a return to the Champions League by winning at the home of rivals, Tottenham. “For me it’s not about the pressure,” he said. “It’s about having that inner belief that tomorrow is the day and tomorrow we want to achieve what we have earned. “It’s more about excitement and the opportunity and when you have that in football you have to go and deliver and do it. That’s the mindset we all have for tomorrow.” Both teams are coming off the back of impressive performances over the weekend. Arsenal secured a four-point gap between them and Spurs when they beat Leeds 2-1 after an Eddie Nketiah brace. Tottenham then put a dent in Liverpool’s quadruple hopes as they picked up a point in an 1-1 draw at Anfield. It is the fourth time in Premier League history that the teams fourth and fifth in the table have played each other in May. The last time it happened was in May 2010, when fourth-placed Tottenham won at fifth-placed Man City to secure a top-four finish and Champions League football. Arsenal have the clear advantage in the top-four race but knowing they can settle for a draw in this spicy encounter might just become a problem. Tottenham have no other option. It’s win or bust for them.   With so many goals in their team and a manager who usually gets the job done in big games, the case for a home win is easy to make.
