Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, said she has withdrawn her ambition to represent Plateau South Senatorial District in the Senate. Tallen announced this in a Tweet on Monday. The minister noted that she will continue to serve Nigeria as Minister of Woman Affairs. “I relish the opportunity to serve Nigerian Women in my capacity as Minister of Women Affairs under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR,” Tallen said. “Consequently, I wish to inform you all that I have to withdraw from running for the Senatorial seat. “With profound gratitude and great humility, I voluntarily stepped down from the Senatorial race, having consulted widely with my family and close associates.” Tallen, however, endorsed Senator Nora Dadduut for a seat to represent Plateau South Senatorial District in the Senate. “Once again I thank the good people of Plateau State Southern Senatorial District and appeal to them to continue to support the incumbent Senator, Prof. Nora Daduut to sustain Women’s political force in the state and in Nigeria,” Tallen said.
