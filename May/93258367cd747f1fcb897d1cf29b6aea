Says it is abominable Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have denied any involvement in what they termed, the abominable beheading of Okechukwu Okoye, who was abducted and killed a few days ago in Anambra State. They also said that enemies of Biafra’s freedom and traitors in ‘our region’ are seriously pulling all stunts to derail the freedom of the detained IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu and that of Biafra. In a statement, yesterday, titled, ‘Beheading of Anambra Lawmaker, Abominable,’ the Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, said the group could not have had anything to do with this abominable act. The statement reads in part: “We, the global family of IPOB, under our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, strongly condemn the abominable beheading of Okoye, who was abducted a few days ago in his area. “After thorough investigations by our intelligence team, we found that the abominable beheading of Okoye is the system of the fifth columnists, who are bent on destabilising the efforts of IPOB. “These barbarians have been well mobilised financially and otherwise by the Department of State Security (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and Directorate of Military Intelligence (DMI) to create anarchy in our land in a temptation to derail our match to freedom. “They will commit these heinous crimes and their paymasters will use Nigeria compromised media houses to accuse IPOB of being responsible for what we know nothing about. “The question is: Why is IPOB being demonised unnecessarily? The simple answer is that we are fighting for the freedom of our people because we rejected their forceful take over of our land. “The IPOB intelligence unit, working round the clock, has discovered the gimmicks and antics of government and its security agencies, especially the Army, DSS, Police, NIA and DMI intelligence. “Those pointing accusing fingers at us are the same people sponsoring the disturbing insecurity in our land.”
