The rising cases of child labour in Africa are a result of the increasing poverty among the populace, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige has said.  Other measures, he said, are the stoppage of unnecessary importation of commodities, such as rice, potato and beans and blockage of revenue leakages.
       
He added that the government was boosting technical and vocational training education, through the restructuring of the entire secondary and tertiary education curricula.
     
He hinted that the government introduced free education at the primary and junior secondary level, as well as a school-feeding programme to tackle low school enrolment. He added that though these efforts were yielding fruits, the Nigerian Government still needed technical support from the ILO.
