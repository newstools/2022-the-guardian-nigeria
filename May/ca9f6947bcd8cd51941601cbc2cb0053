Speaker, Imo House of Assembly, Mr. Kennedy Ibeh, has lauded Nigerian journalists for their role in nation building as the world marked the 2022 World Press Freedom Day. This is contained in a statement signed by the speaker’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Ifeanyi Onyekachi, and made available to newsmen in Owerri, yesterday. Ibeh said that Nigerian journalists are nation builders, whose roles had sustained the Nigerian democracy. He advised journalists to use the opportunity to appraise and recommit themselves to the ethics that guide their profession. He said: “Without adherence to ethics, professions will become part of national malaise, rather than solutions. “That is why journalists must constantly recommit to canons of fairness, accuracy, objectivity, balance, and other ideals that guide their profession. “While celebrating the World Press Freedom Day, I urge them to rededicate themselves to the role of being watchdogs of society. “We, as government, will continue to support the media and ensure that they are not muzzled in anyway.” The speaker appealed to journalists in Imo to see themselves as partners and always support Hope Uzodimma’s administration by projecting the state in positive light.
