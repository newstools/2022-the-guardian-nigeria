Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said he is the most qualified and capable aspirant to the country’s top office. Addressing PDP delegates in Birnin Kebbi, yesterday, ahead of the national convention, Wike said he has full knowledge of leadership than others. The governor, who expressed dismay over bad governance by the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration, urged Nigerians to shun the ruling party, which failed the people. “Those that are contesting in my party cannot lead the country. I was the one that rescued the party when it was at the verge of collapsing,” he boasted. Wike, who promised to restructure the country, if given the chance to lead, added: “I have the means to change the fortunes of the country for the better. “Don’t mind the Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara factor; you should consider who can perform,” he said. Kebbi PDP Chairman, Alhaji Bello Suru, assured Wike that Kebbi votes are all for him.
