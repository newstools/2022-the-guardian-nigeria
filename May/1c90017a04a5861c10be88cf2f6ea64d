Smooth Take-off Excites Nwamucha The Chairman of Delta Football Association (DFA), Kenneth Nwamucha, is excited about the turnout of teams for the 2022 Delta FA Cup competition, which kicked off on Thursday across four venues in Delta State. DFA had recently unveiled Asaba Airport Company as its main sponsor for the 2022 FA Cup tournament. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Nwamucha stated that this year’s edition of the FA Cup recorded a huge turn out 42 teams. “I am sure this is the highest number we have recorded in Delta FA Cup competition and I am very excited,” he stated. The competition, according to Nwamucha, is held in four venues, Warri, Sapele, Kwale and Agbor. He assured all participating teams of a hitch-free tournament, just as he thanked football administrators, club owners and their representatives for their commitment and understanding so far. The best team in this year’s Delta FA Cup competition in the men’s category will get a cash price of N800, 000, while the second-best team pockets N400, 000. Nwamucha also disclosed yesterday that the best team in the women’s category will get N500,000 while the second-best gets N300,000. “Since our past chairman, now the NFF President, Mr. Amaju Pinnick, left Delta State to face national football, we have not had any sponsor. A few months ago, with the approval of my board members, we were able to get this partnership deal with Asaba Airport Company done. “I am happy that I have a very hard-working and dedicated team as board members, and that is why we are having the good results,” Nwamucha stated.
