Ahead of the APC’s primaries, youths in Katsina State have staged a rally in the metropolis in support of the presidential ambition of Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi. Addressing the youth on Saturday in Katsina, the Coordinator of Rescue Nigeria Mission in the state, Alhaji Abdullahi Usman, said the rally was to mobilise the people of the state, especially the youth, to support Bello. According to him, the rally is necessary because the Kogi governor has done a lot of developmental projects in the state, especially the youths’ empowerment programmes. “Bello has done a lot in terms of security in Kogi State; the state is among the most peaceful in the country, especially in the northern part. “I believe this is achieved due to his commitments, and interest in the progress of the country. “Therefore, the people of Katsina should also give their support for his presidential aspiration. “Security is among the top challenges in the country, therefore he has strategies to tackle the problem in the country. “And also, we are seeking the women, and youths’ support for Bello, because he is a youth like us. “We have the belief that he will carry us along, and will be the best,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the youth, including people with special needs, converged on the APC state secretariat.
