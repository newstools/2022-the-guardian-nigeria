A governorship aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Olawale Oluwo, has said he will restore the sovereign power of the people and return Lagos wealth to the people. He said this would reset the state on a new trajectory of security and inclusive prosperity. Oluwo, who was Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources and former leader of Ambode Campaign Organisation, spoke yesterday during his formal declaration to contest for the office of governor of Lagos State on the platform of APC. He said: “ I am running for office because I believe in the promise of Lagos and the capacity of its people to be great. I do not see Lagos as just one of the 36 states of Nigeria; I see it as a city-state capable of attaining self-sufficiency in provision of amenities for all inhabitants, just like Dubai. “If given the opportunity to govern Lagos State, I will provide the leadership for a new team that will work to restore the dignity of Lagos State and re-establish its leadership role as we used to know it.” Oluwo identified gridlock, inadequate power supply, massive unemployment, deteriorating ease of doing business, insecurity, flooding and lack of potable water, among others, as the challenges facing the state. He said that if voted as governor, he would return the wealth of Lagos to the people, involve youths in governance, prepare them for fast leadership transition, re-establish the status of Lagos as reference point for free democratic practice and implement reforms in critical sectors for Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, revenues and jobs.
