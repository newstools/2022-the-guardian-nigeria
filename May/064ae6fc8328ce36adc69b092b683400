Stakeholders, at the weekend, gathered in Gombe State to ask Maj. Hamza Al-Mustapha (rtd) to join the presidential race. Speaking at the event organised by Hamza Al-Mustapha Media Awareness (HALMA), a lecturer at the Federal University of Agriculture, Kashere (FUK,) Dr. Babayo Sule, told newsmen that Nigeria had wallowed enough in insecurity, which reduced it to a weakling in the comity of nations. Not certain on what political platform he will contest, sources hinted that Al-Mustapha, who was security aide to the late despot, Gen. Sani Abacha, is likely to feature on the platform of Action Alliance (AA). Hinging their request on the ravaging insecurity in the country, the eggheads agreed that only Al-Mustapha could rescue the nation from its myriad problems including insecurity. Also, a lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies, Gombe State University (GSU), Mohammed Habib, said: “Nigeria has never been thirsty of good leaders than now, hence we call on Al-Mustapha to come out and rescue our country out of its insecurity, our security is in shamble. “As a security expert, only him can take the country back from bandits, insurgents and other threats,” he pleaded. He added that Nigeria does not need zoning now but a capable candidate like the former security adviser to take it out of the wood, adding: “We don’t want zoning now; we need a capable and better candidate that can deliver.”
