Plans 26,000 Jobs In First Day As President Business mogul, Tein Jack-Rich, has declared interest in Nigeria’s highest political office, promising to make the citizens proud again.
He told newsmen, yesterday, that if elected, he would address security issues by ensuring a vibrant economy that would engage the restive youths and use technology to end the activities of the unknown gunmen. Jack-Rich was reportedly orphaned at the age of 10, but, with a dint of hard work, became a prominent entrepreneur and philanthropy.
His campaign director, former Governor Isa Yuguda of Bauchi State, said he has taken the responsibility of marketing the accomplished businessman.
 
He urged Nigerians to undermine religion and tribe while profiling President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor.
 
“This is somebody we cannot afford not to have in 2023. He is a philanthropist with a difference, cutting across tribes and cultures.
 
“He is apparently the only person in the private sector that has been investing his money in the survival of human beings,” he said.
 
In his speech, Jack-Rich said that if given the opportunity to rule, he would ensure that Nigeria produces what it consumes and consumes what it produces.  The 47-year-old aspirant promised to uphold the traditional institution and strengthen the traditional value system. He added: “I will go to any troubled area myself. I will not send anyone. Let us not compromise Nigeria for friendship, tribe or religion.”
 
According to him, the knowledge-based economy he will create will birth education, technology and innovation. This, he said, will put the system on the right path and, incessant closure of tertiary institutions will be a thing of the past. He blamed inflation on Nigeria’s inability to produce what it consumes.
 
“We need a game-changer whose heart is for the people. I will make Nigerians proud.”
