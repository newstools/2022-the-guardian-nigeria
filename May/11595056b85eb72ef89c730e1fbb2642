The feat achieved by 17-year-old Ronke Akanbi has become a source of inspiration to Team Nigeria’s 10-man contingent at the ongoing 19th International School Sports Federation (ISF) Gymnasiade 2022 holding in Normandy, France. Akanbi yesterday smashed Nigeria’s 3000m record after running 9.36.86 seconds to win the gold medal at the ISF Gymnasiade, which is the first medal to be won by any African team at the tournament. An excited president of Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF), Olabisi Joseph, said Akanbi’s performance has brought vibrancy to the country’s camp in France. Joseph, who led the team to the multi-sport fiesta, added: “For us at NSSF, this is a big feat and this is what we believe can restore the lost glory of Nigeria when we expose our young athletes to international competitions. “As part of NSSF’s plans, we decided to return Nigeria to the global family with our presence in France and we are happy that our participation has been worthwhile with what Akanbi has achieved. “I am impressed with our athletes because they have shown courage and determination in the midst of other athletes and we hope this feat in France inspires other Nigerian students to aim high, both on track and in class.” Nigeria and 10 other African countries are competing at the global championships with Uganda having the largest contingent of 40 competing in five events. Other African nations in France are Algeria, Mauritius, Senegal, Madagascar, Cote d’Ivoire, and Tanzania. The 19th edition of the ISF Gymnasiade is an international competition for 15-18-year-olds holding in multiple cities across the region. More than 3,000 participants from 80 international delegations, spread over 17 disciplines (three parasports), are in Normandy for the event.
