This edition had as theme: Experience Nollywood and it was held in partnership and with the support of the Nigerian Embassy in Greece and some Nollywood Guild and Association including, the Association of Movie Producers (AMP) and the Directors Guild of Nigeria (DGN). Founder of NTFF Mykel Parish Ajaere stated at the well-attended opening ceremony of the NTFF that the festival aims at sharing the Nollywood journey with the world while also providing the platform to change the African narrative through film and to foster relationships with developed countries. Four films featured in this diet of the festival — Collision Course, Lockdown, Kunle Afolayan’s award winning feature, Citation and Paul Apel Papel’s award winning feature, Eagle Wings.

However, the 13th DFM programme will focus on the ever-shifting evolution within the industry, the game changers working to bring inclusivity and access to all levels of filmmakers, and the new spaces driving content creation. With Africa and the African Diaspora at the heart of the industry programme, mainstream film professionals, established independents, emerging and alternative filmmakers who continue to shape new directions with their work will present masterclasses, panel discussions and hangout sessions. Other programmes include, a pitch and finance forum which features a selection of 40 projects in development to pitch to a panel of decision makers, the DFM content shop—a digital curation of projects ready for sale and Durban Docs which is opened to Documentary film directors, organisations and initiatives presenting on the creative documentary filmmaking process.

Diversity, inclusivity and access is at the heart of the Durban Filmmart Institution ethos, which is apparent in the sessions on Queer Representation, Women in Film, the Economically Marginalised, Africa in the Diaspora, Global South and Global North Relationships and South to South Partnerships.
