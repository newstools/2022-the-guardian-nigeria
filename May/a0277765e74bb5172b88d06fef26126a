From Rihanna popularising them individually through her everyday style to MiuMiu embodying them, its omnipresence has been topping the fashion charts. The miniskirt is officially back in action after it was seen severally on the spring ‘22 runways and in real life on style stars street like Olivia Rodrigo, Dua Lipa, among others. The Miumiu micro mini has taken over 2022 as one of the biggest fashion trends as it has graced half a dozen magazine covers worn by celebrities like Zendaya, Yoona Lim, Bella Hadid, Nicole Kidman, Hailey Baldwin, Hunter Schafer. Go sporty Tennis skirts are another variation of mini skirts. Luckily, they are easy to style – just slip on a pair of white sneakers and layer on a sporty polo or neat crew-neck sweatshirt – and look cute on everyone. Denim now and always A denim miniskirt gives you the best of both worlds: the ease and effortless appeal of blue jeans, plus the elevated, party-ready feeling of a reemergence skirt. Monochrome The easiest and fastest way to style up a miniskirt and look classy is a monochrome look. Choose the garments in a colour that best suits your skin, mix and match with different shades of the color, and play with textures and prints. Colour Blocking If you want to experiment with your style, you can opt for a colour blocking fit with pairs of pink and red, blue and green, yellow and blue and many more. Just ensure that you are pairing the right colors together, else it’ll be an eyesore.
