The painful rise in prices of virtually all commodities, including mainstays like food and oil, is both an economic and political problem. While the Nigerian monetary authority appears to have been overwhelmed by several interventions to the economy, the fact remains that the Muhammadu Buhari administration has done a poor job at managing inflation and everyone is paying the price. In retrospect, the Bretton Woods institutions had recently warned about Nigeria’s inflation problem, citing it as a key driver for the rising number of poor people in the country. While many have blamed Russia-Ukraine crisis for the present inflation trigger, what has been equally ignored are the lingering structural and security challenges driving prices of food and basic services beyond the reach of the poor and the almost non-existent middle class. Inflation rate in Nigeria rose to 15.92 per cent on a year-on-year basis in March, from 15.7 per cent recorded in February, according to the latest data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). In its latest report on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March 2022, the NBS attributed the spike in inflation for the month under review, mostly to the composite food index, which rose to 17.20 per cent in March and a sharp increase in the price of cooking gas.
