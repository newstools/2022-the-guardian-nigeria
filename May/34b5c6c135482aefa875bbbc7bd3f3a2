Yoruba community in Gombe State has lamented the way the government of Muhammad Yahaya has been treating them since he assumed office. Leader of the Yoruba in Gombe, Oba Abdulrahim Yusuf, told newsmen, yesterday, that the Yoruba were well-treated and regarded in Kano and other Northern states but disregarded in Gombe, despite their commitment and contribution to the state. Attending to newsmen in his Orji Estate palace in Gombe, the monarch said: “Even if no Yoruba man is good enough to make the commissioners’ list, we ought to be considered for the Special Adviser/Assistant position.” Aside the positions, he also decried the formula used to share the recently procured 1,000 tricycles, as no Yoruba benefited. He, however, disclosed that his office had made several representations to the Secretary to the State Government (SSG) on the neglect of Yoruba in the state. Meanwhile, the monarch commended the governor for his developmental projects in the state, urging him to strive further in delivering his campaign promises to Gombawa.
