There were rumours earlier in the week that the influential APC leader, who is also contesting for president, may not endorse Sanwo-Olu for another term. “Asiwaju ⁦@officialABAT officially endorsed Governor ⁦@jidesanwoolu and deputy @drobafemihamzat for second term,” Gboyega Akosila, who is Sanwo-Olu’s chief press secretary tweeted on Friday along with a video of Tinubu raising the hands of the governor and his deputy.
