Sir: Several weeks after some people were abducted in the bombing of the Abuja-Kaduna train, the victims have been left in the lurch and despite all the pleas by the families of those affected, the government has carried on as if all is well and nothing is at stake. The National Assembly which ought to push the issue to the front burner has gone to sleep; the human rights bodies are feeling unconcerned while the major focus of the nation’s politicians now is how to obtain and submit nomination forms. What has happened so far paints a grim picture of a nation where both the government and the governed have lost their humanity and no matter whatever happens to anyone, life goes on as no one bats any eyelids. In all that has happened however, some dramatic personae in the whole saga are perhaps guilty of displaying the most high sense of irresponsibility. How would anyone imagine that some of them even obtained the nomination form to vie for the position of the president of the country? Again, it’s difficult to believe that the Ministry of Transport is planning to reopen the rail lines after the repair works are completed. This is something everyone must rise up against. There should not be any return to work until all those captured are rescued. Besides, there should be much guarantee that the tracks are safe before the lives of other set of people will be put in jeopardy.
