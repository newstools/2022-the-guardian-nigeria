Last Mile Financial Services Limited, a Fintech startup, has launched a payment app called Pay Masta. The app allows companies’ employees to access funds for emergency situations before their salaries are paid.  
  
Speaking at the launch in Lagos, the Co-Founder of the company, Gerald Erih, said that the solution was borne out of a genuine response to employees’ payment challenges.
   
He said: “We observed that in Nigeria, about 80 per cent of workers live paycheck to paycheck. So, we developed this solution to enable them not just to have access to the money they have earned anytime they need it, but also to help them plan their finances and track their expenses so that they can live debt-free.”
