Jail records obtained in Fulton Country, Georgia, reveal that the rapper was booked on two charges; conspiracy to violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act, or RICO, and a charge of participation in criminal street gang activity. The RICO charge is from an alleged January 2013 incident, while the criminal street gang activity charge is linked to an alleged incident from May 2018. According to Complex, Young Thug, real name Jeffery Lamar Williams, was taken into custody by the Atlanta police during a raid on his home. Atlanta ABC affiliate WSB-TV reports that the charges made against him stem from a larger 56-count indictment, in which 28 individuals have been named, including rapper Gunna. The indictment, according to the publication, names multiple affiliates of Williams’ YSL gang and contains charges including “Maintaining armed individuals ready and willing to preserve, protect and enhance the reputation, power and territory of the enterprise through the use of violence; Obtaining money, weapons and other property through acts of racketeering activity, including robbery, theft and the unlawful sale and distribution of drugs; and Obstructing law enforcement investigations and court proceedings through witness intimidation and attacks upon law enforcement officers.” Brian Steel, Williams’ attorney, told WSB-TV, “I’ll tell you the response to any allegation is Mr. Williams committed no crime whatsoever and we will fight to my last drop of blood to clear him.”
