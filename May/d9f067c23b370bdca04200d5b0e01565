The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has charged passengers and boat drivers to obey guidelines regulating waterways transportation. NIWA, while expressing condolence to the families of the victims of the Lagos boat mishap and government of Kastina State, said it would not relent on efforts to make inland waterway transportation safe. Recall that about 15 persons lost their lives on May 4 in a boat mishap that occurred around 11 pm in Mai-Adua Local Government Area of Katsina State, with President Muhammadu Buhari warning against the use of rickety boats, overloading and none use of life jackets by passengers. In the statement by the General Manager, Corporate Affairs, NIWA, Jibril Darda’u, said the accident was caused by night sailing, which is against the safety guidelines of waterway transportation. He said it is sad that the accident occurred despite all the measures put in place by the agency to forestall such mishaps.
Darda’u said the agency had recently distributed life jackets and some patrol vessels to all its area offices across the country to enhance surveillance and monitoring of activities on the waterways. “We further wish to appeal to passengers and boat drivers to obey the rules and guidelines regulating passenger transportation. The use of life jackets; no sailing at night; the use of standard boats and not overloading the boats are key guidelines for safe passenger transportation,” he noted.
