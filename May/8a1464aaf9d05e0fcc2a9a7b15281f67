• Experts insist growth not inclusive, blame rising population, others
Nigeria’s output grew by 3.1 per cent in real-time in the first quarter but the expansion lags modestly from the 4.2 per cent annualised growth projected by the Federal Government in its yearly budget framework.
  
The quarterly growth curve may have been sloping downward as the economy slumped by 15 per cent quarter-on-quarter (Q/Q). The Guardian had, earlier in the year, reported that the growth charts were flattening out towards the end of last year.
 
According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics ((NBS), yesterday, the country’s real Gross Domestic Product (real GDP) stood at N17.57 trillion, N3.1 trillion short of N20.67 trillion reported in the last quarter (Q4) of last year. Q4 outputs, however, are extremely positively influenced by seasonal activities.  “In real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 93.37 per cent to the nation’s GDP in the first quarter of 2022, higher than the share recorded in the first quarter of 2021, which was 90.75 per cent and lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 recorded as 94.81 per cent.”
