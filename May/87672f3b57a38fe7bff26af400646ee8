President of Osisioma Foundation, Dr. Chike Obidigbo, has described the emergence of Mr. Peter Obi as Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate as a divine architecture for a better Nigeria. He stressed that no matter how hard forces of retrogression try, nothing can stop an idea whose time has come, stressing that Obi is coming to mobilise Nigerians for social and ethical change. In a statement made available to journalists, yesterday, Obidigbo, who was the consensus governorship candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in 2013, noted that sometimes individuals prepare for a journey, but the journey takes them to the desired destination. He remarked that right from 2003, when Obi’s mandate was stolen through blatant electoral manipulation, and his eventual eight years in office as governor of Anambra State, God has been preparing the former governor for a time like this, when political corruption has reached its peak.
