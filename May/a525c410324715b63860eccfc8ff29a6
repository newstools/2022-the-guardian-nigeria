 House-of-the-Dragon- HBO HBO Max has unveiled an all-new trailer for Game of Thrones prequel House of The Dragon.   The soon to be released series based on the fantasy book series by George R.R. Martin is set in a time before Game of Thrones, which wrapped its eight-season run in 2019. In the almost two-minute-long clip, the fight to claim the Iron Throne for the ‘pursuit of legacy’ is teased. Princess Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) is named successor to the throne by King Viserys I Targaryen (Paddy Considine). Though many “promise to be faithful to King Viserys” due to this choice, not everyone agrees. “Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne,” says Princess Rhaenys Targaryen (Eve Best). A series of scenes reveals the “ugly game” ahead, teasing the gory and violent war that would split many. A male figure adds, “History does not remember blood.” Martin’s 2018 novel Fire & Blood is the inspiration for House of the Dragon. In the series developed by Martin and Ryan J. Condal, viewers will watch events that occurred 200 years before those shown in Game of Thrones. It will also tell the House Targaryen narrative. The cast includes Matt Smith, Olivia Cooke, Steve Toussaint, Fabien Frankel, Sonoya Mizuno, and Rhys Ifans. Martin revealed that he watched a preliminary version of the planned prequel in December and gave it his seal of approval. “Okay, I am hardly objective. And I know a lot of what you will be seeing. (I, um, wrote the book),” he wrote in a post on his website. “Also … mum’s the word now, don’t tell anyone… I’ve seen a rough cut of the first episode. And loved it. It’s dark, it’s powerful, it’s visceral… just the way I like my epic fantasy.”
