 Tiwa Savage Tiwa Savage during her performance in Brooklyn paid her respect to the late rapper Notorious B.I.G., opening the show with “Save My Life.”
Tiwa, dressed in a silk Fendi suit with a black fitted cap, mimicked the opening lyric of Notorious B.I.G.’s classic “Juicy.” “Remember Rappin’ Duke?/ You never thought that Afrobeats would take it this far.” The remark not only paid homage to Biggie and Brooklyn, but it also established a link between the rise of hip-hop and Afrobeats around the world. Throughout the show, Savage spoke with the audience, asking one female fan, “What is your name?” … Your name is Princess …? No you must be the Queen! You’re far too beautiful to just be a princess!”
To close up the show, Savage sang her most famous song with “Somebody’s Son”, which was recorded with R&B superstar Brandy and released on her EP “Water & Garri.”
Tiwa Savage’s career began as a backup singer for George Michael and Mary J. Blige when she moved to London as a child and has since carved her niche as a musician.
Her debut album, “Once Upon a Time,” was nominated for album of the year at the 2014 Nigerian Entertainment Awards.
She signed with Universal in 2019 and appeared on Beyonce’s “Lion King” soundtrack before releasing her “Celia” album the following year.
