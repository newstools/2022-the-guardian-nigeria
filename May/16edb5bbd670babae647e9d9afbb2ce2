 Energy Capital & Power (ECP) (www.EnergyCapitalPower.com) – the leading investment platform for the African energy sector – is focused on driving investment into the continent and accelerating the development of key sectors to ensure long-term, sustainable economic growth through its lineup of industry-focused events taking place in key regions across the continent.  ECP unites Africa’s leaders in energy and related sectors, providing the best platform to make deals and discuss the future of the energy industry. ECP will host three large-scale, in-person events scheduled this year. First in line is the MSGBC Oil, Gas & Power  Conference and Exhibition (https://bit.ly/3lxJU0X) will be taking place from September 1-2; next, the fifth edition of South Sudan Oil & Power (https://bit.ly/3NsKkBx) will be taking place in Juba from September 13-14; and finally, Angola Oil & Gas (https://bit.ly/3wDIybb) from November 29 and 30 to December 1. These events offer the perfect opportunity for investors to be introduced to African opportunities, companies to engage and share information, lessons and challenges, and for multi-million-dollar deals to be signed and executed. Investment, engagement and deal-making represent the pillars of ECP’s events – and there are a number of ways stakeholders can get involved. ATTEND ENERGY CAPITAL & POWER’S EVENTS In 2021, over 5,000 delegates made their way to ECP’s events, attending panel discussions, networking functions and investor forums. In 2022, ECP expects an even higher attendance on the back of restored travel routes, the easing of social gathering restrictions and increased vaccinations across the continent. With the COVID-19 pandemic preventing any large-scale event from taking place on the continent in 2020, ECP is focused on making up for lost time, and the attendance opportunities at the 2022 event lineup represent that very objective.
