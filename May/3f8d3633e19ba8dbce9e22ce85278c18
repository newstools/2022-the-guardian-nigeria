The reality TV stars and former friends took to Twitter to accuse each other over their wrongdoings. Carolyna had called Toyin out for allegedly spreading rumours about her marriage to Musa Danjuma, which ended in 2019. She also asked Toyin to provide proof that she had publicly accused her before now of destroying her home. Carolyna tweeted, “Toyin, make it make sense to me. How do you know what ended my marriage when my marriage ended in 2016 and I stopped speaking with you in 2009?” “How can you be part of the break up when you never existed in it? Girl, stop with the lies. You ain’t that relevant.” On the other hand, Toyin accused Carolyna of breaking up her former relationship, causing her ex to throw her out. “Stop normalizing my relationship I was engaged m*** &you ruined it , I was chased out with my Daughter , my stores where taken from me , I had no clothes on my back,” Tiannah wrote. However, Caryolna revealed that this was why Toyin tried to spoil her (Carolyna) name by accusing her of also sleeping with small boys. “You carried my name around out of revenge that I was sleeping with small boys. Those who know the gist can verify. My ex never believed you,” Carolyna responded. The duo continued to tweet allegations and accusations of cheating, lies and deception.
