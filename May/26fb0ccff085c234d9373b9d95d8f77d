Sports enthusiasts in Nigeria have been excited over the opening of the flagship PUMA store at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The event, which took place recently at the Jabi Lake Mall, Abuja, was the outcome of a pact between Amstel Malta Ultra and The Mix Africa, a top quality sports brand.
 
The event was an eclectic mix of the athletic style, fashion and great vibes as guests included A-list socialites, Abuja sport and fashion influencers, fitness enthusiasts and the brand’s esteemed customers, who had the opportunity to meet and network with ace musician and global PUMA ambassador, Davido, and renowned national Statesman, Bukola Saraki. Guests had their fill of delicious hors d’oeuvres and, of course, were refreshed by chilled cans of Amstel Malta Ultra. Speaking at the event, Senior Key Accounts Manager, Nigerian Breweries, Olukayode Akintola, said the brand was committed to promoting a healthy lifestyle through sports. “With health and fitness being our greatest priority at Amstel Malta Ultra, the brand believes in the importance of advancing sports culture in Nigeria. This is why we are supporting PUMA on the grand opening of this exquisite outlet to make sportswear accessible to all Nigerians. Being a brand of so many firsts in championing a healthier alternative for Nigerians, Amstel Malta Ultra has repositioned itself as the number one malt drink of choice for all consumers, especially among the teeming health-conscious class,” Akintola said.
 
Akintola noted that as a health and fitness inspired brand, Amstel Malta Ultra remains a top choice of healthy refreshment for sportsmen and health and fitness enthusiasts. “It is the first-ever, no-added-sugar malt drink in Nigeria, fully enriched with vitamins and minerals to deliver healthy refreshments and premium nourishment with superior taste,” he added.
