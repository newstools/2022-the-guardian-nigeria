This happened a week before he was scheduled to fly to London for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, Thomas Markle, 77, was struck down and lost his speech. Mr Markle, who resides in Rosarito, Mexico, was admitted to a hospital in Tijuana, Mexico, where he was observed arriving wearing an oxygen mask and escorted by paramedics. He was seen on a stretcher with a pale face and one hand over his chest in a video uploaded on TMZ’s website. He was then transported to the United States by paramedics around 9.30 p.m. to a clinic in Chula Vista, California, just a few hours away from Meghan and Harry’s home in Montecito. It was unclear last night whether Meghan, who is estranged from her father, plans to see him in his hospital bed. At the time, his son Thomas Jr., was with him and is being treated in a hospital near San Diego, while Samantha was expected to arrive from her home in Florida. His daughter Samantha told sources “My father is recovering in hospital. We ask for privacy for the family, for his health and wellbeing. He just needs peace and rest. Godspeed. We are praying. He just needs some rest.” Mr Markle will be absent from the London celebrations, just as dad was absent from Meghan’s wedding to Harry in 2018 due to a heart attack.
