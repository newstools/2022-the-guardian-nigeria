Stakeholders in the maritime industry have called on the Federal Government to dissolve the Boards of some agencies, including the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Maritime Academy of Nigeria (MAN) and the Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT) “hurriedly” inaugurated by former Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi in Abuja on Friday last week.  On his part, the National Coordinator of Niger Delta Transparency, Accountability and Good Governance Group (Niger Delta TAG), Chief Julius Godspower, said there must be “something fishy somewhere” about the hasty inauguration of the boards by the former Minister. “One hopes that the new leadership of the Ministry will look into that action and reverse it. The former Minister has a penchant for impunity and disregard for due process, which is rather unbecoming and must not be allowed to stand,” he said.
