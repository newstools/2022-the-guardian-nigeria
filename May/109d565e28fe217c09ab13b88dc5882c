Both lawyers gave closing arguments in the current trial in Fairfax, Virginia, summarizing much of what has been said on both sides since the trial began on April 11. Rottenborn said, “if he abused her one time, Amber wins,” and accused Depp of having “almost all of” his witnesses on his payroll. “Let’s see the monster. Let’s see the monster in the flesh,” Rottenborn added, before playing the video of Depp slamming cabinets in the former couple’s kitchen. In her closing arguments, Depp’s attorney Camille Vasquez said, “You either believe all of it, or none of it.” She said of Heard’s abuse allegations against Depp, “Either she’s a victim of truly horrific abuse or she’s a woman who’s willing to say absolutely anything.” Vasquez also accused Heard, 36, of “profound cruelty,” and of coming “into this courtroom prepared to give the performance of her life, and she gave it.” Depp took the witness stand for the last time on Wednesday, conveying the impact Heard’s testimony had on life. “No human being is perfect, certainly not. None of us. But I have never in my life committed sexual battery, physical abuse, all these outlandish, outrageous stories of me committing these things and living with it for six years and waiting to be able to bring the truth out,” he said. Depp is suing his ex-wife for defamation over an article she wrote for The Washington Post about becoming “a public figure representing domestic abuse.”
