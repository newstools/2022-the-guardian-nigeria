One of the contenders for the Kano gubernatorial seat, Abdulsalam A. Zaura would remain loyal to Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and the leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, according to Hajiya Ibrahim Balaraba. Balaraba, a political associate and strong supporter of Zaura campaign group gave the assurance while speaking with journalists in Kano. Balaraba explained that the gubernatorial ambition of Zaura is a selfless service intended to contribute his wealth of knowledge and international influence to build a prosperous Kano. She, however, insisted that no amount of distraction or political manipulation would deter the International business tycoon on the path of dedication and loyalty to APC. Balaraba, who was apparently responding to speculation on the purported endorsement of Deputy Governor Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna by Ganduje as successor, declared that Zaura is ready to accept whatever outcome of the APC stakeholders meeting held at Government House on Saturday. “In a situation like this, there is the possibility of people carrying rumors here and there and I can still confirm to you that the governor has not come out to declare that this is my candidate,” Balaraba said. “For me, AA Zaura is my candidate and we pray he will get it. But whoever the Governor will endorse should be the best candidate. AA Zaura has a strong fate belief in Governor Ganduje and we would continue to support him on the next step he takes on bbecometo the next candidate of the party. Whatever decision the governor takes we believe there is wisdom in it. “I want to urge people to disregard the allegation and it’s all about politics especially when people realized your prospect, they are ready to go the extra mile to tarnish the person’s image. “For an international businessman well blessed and endowed by the almighty God, such allegations are mere allegations being orchestrated by political enemies and I can assure you they will not succeed.”
