• FIFA bans Nigerian player for two years
Flying Eagles’ forward, Ahmed Abdullahi, has recovered and is recuperating in hospital following a scary incident during the Nigeria, Burkina Faso game at the WAFU B Championship in Niamey, Niger Republic on Wednesday.
 
The former Golden Eaglet, who scored Nigeria’s second goal against cup holders and African champions, Ghana, on Sunday after coming off the bench, was rushed to hospital after suffering a head injury during the 2-2 draw with the Junior Etalons at the Stade General Seyni Kountché.
 
“The player has recovered fully and is in good health, but he is out of the tournament. We went through several scary hours before and after he got to the hospital, but we thank God that he is fully recovered now,” Team Secretary Aliyu Lawal Ibrahim told thenff.com.
 
Nigeria Football Federation’s (NFF) General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, was with the Abdullahi at the hospital and asked the player to remain focused and pray for the team to succeed at the tournament.  The Bangladesh Football Federation had placed a two-year worldwide ban on Iyikwobe on September 26, 2021 and subsequently appealed to FIFA to give it worldwide effect.
 
FIFA has now granted the request and Iyikwobe remains suspended from all football–related activities globally until September 26, 2023.
