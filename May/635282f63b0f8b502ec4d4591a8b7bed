He told The Guardian that his latest work titled “The Heritage Project Lagos”, was born out of the need to curb the abuse of children in the country. Eghosagreat said his aim is to change the mindset of child abusers and that was what inspired his desire to work on a project against Child Abuse. This inspiration was what led to the creation of a movement called The Heritage Project. He said: “The Heritage Project is an avenue to reach out to people through the message in the song which would also serve as an anthem during outreaches. With the help of sponsors, the movement will be reaching out to other cities in Nigeria like Benin, Abuja and Calabar.” The Heritage Project held an event recently in Lagos where the song was performed for the first time to guests. Eghosa Frank revealed that the purpose of The Heritage Project is of more importance to him than his brand. He said: “Child Abuse is really a serious thing, there is a lot of evil abuse(s) going on in our society. These have messed up the lives of our little ones. Our children deserve all the love and care in the world and it is all our responsibility to stop the savage practice”. Eghosagreat believes he has come as a change agent to fight against social vices towards the child through the aid of music and is definitely on the quest to achieve a great result. He made his first break into the Nigerian music scene when he led and won with a 6-man band named jukebox at the 2010 Star Quest edition – a reality show sponsored by the Nigerian Brewery Plc. The show also helped him discover his songwriting skills. Since then, he has appeared on stage with some of Nigeria’s A-list artistes and recently completed a music project with a Gospel Singer – Nosa. The Edo State-born artiste is a lover of God, music, drums and also a passionate lover of his craft. He is married to his lovely wife – Ivie and blessed with 2 generals – Owen and Joey.
