More facts have emerged on why the planned acquisition of shallow water assets of Mobil Producing Unlimited, Nigeria (MPNU) is delayed.
Seplat, an indigenous energy company, had in February sealed an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU from Exxon Mobil Corporation.
 
The transaction, which is subject to ministerial consent and other required regulatory approvals, is a sale and purchase agreement to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU for a purchase price of $1.28 million, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.
   
Chief Executive Officer, Seplat Energy Plc, Mr. Roger Brown, while reviewing the company’s unaudited results for the three months ended 31 March 2022, said the parties are still “awaiting the necessary approvals from government and regulators.”  “The acquisition will reinforce our leadership of Nigeria’s indigenous energy sector and enabling us to generate strong future cash flows that will underpin our investment in Nigeria’s energy transition and improve our overall stakeholder returns. 
   
“It will also bring a significant undeveloped gas resource base which, alongside our ANOH gas project development, will underpin Nigeria’s energy transition and drive domestic and export revenues when developed,” he said.
