 PHOTO: ABC NEWS Blac Chyna’s lawyer has confirmed she will appeal the verdict of her defamation case against the Kardashian-Jenner family.   This comes after the court cleared the Kardashian members of all key questions on Monday, and no monetary damages were awarded to Chyna. Speaking to The Associated Press, Chyna’s legal attorney Lynee Ciani said, “The jury found that Chyna had not physically abused Rob Kardashian.” She noted that “the jury found that all four defendants had intentionally interfered with her contract with the E! Network.” In response, she said she and her client “will appeal on the remaining questions.” While Kim Kardashian was dropped from the suit by a judge earlier in the trial, her sisters Kylie Jenner, Khloé Kardashian and Kris Jenner were named in the defamation suit. Chyna had attempted to prove that the Kardashian-Jenner family had purposely interfered to cause the cancellation of her E! show Rob & Chyna — which aired while she was engaged to Rob Kardashian. Explaining her reason for the suit, Chyna wrote on Twitter, “When they got my No. 1 hit show killed back in January 2017, that not only hurt me financially and emotionally, that hurt my beautiful KIDS.” “I’m taking them to court to stand up for my legal rights and to be an example to my kids that ‘what’s right is right, what’s wrong is wrong,'” she continued. “And what they did was so wrong. I am so thankful that a jury will finally listen to what really happened behind closed doors — the lies that were told and the damage that was done.”
