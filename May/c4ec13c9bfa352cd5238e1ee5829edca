With 17 out of the 40-member Kano State House of Assembly joining the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), it looks like the state is about to change the face of its leadership.  To show that things are falling apart in APC, efforts by the incumbent Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje to reconcile aggrieved loyalists of Senator Ibrahim Shekarau failed to bear fruits as climate of suspicion and crisis of confidence pervade the Kano polity.  
    
Last Friday, Governor Ganduje led a delegation of party stakeholders, including leader of the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, to the Nassarawa residence of Malam Shekarau in a bid to prevent his planned defection to NNPP.
   
A source privy to the meeting confided in The Guardian that Governor Ganduje came along with his team to meet Senator Shekarau in the Senator’s home around 8:00pm.
