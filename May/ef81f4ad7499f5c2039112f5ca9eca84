Former Chief of Air Staff (CAS) and Ambassador to Chad, Air Marshall Sadique Abubakar, has applauded the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and supporters for electing him as the party’s flag-bearer for the 2023 governorship ballot in Bauchi State. Abubakar told journalists, yesterday, that he has commenced reaching out to other aspirants, who contested with him to take over power from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). According to him, last week’s primary election was his first attempt in democratic contest. He added that he is in the race to bring development to the people of the state. His words: “This is the first time I am going through this process. In our own system, we just give directives and they are carried out. There is no story. It is also something we are very familiar with. Having being to Staff College and International College, we understand the interaction within the political and military sides of the society. “I was glad seeing different people from the villages coming to decide who they think should be in charge of their affairs in this party. It was very exciting. I appreciate the committee that came from Abuja to conduct a peaceful primary in the presence of every aspirant. I have learnt a lot.” The Air Force chief said the number of out-of-school children and state’s of health sector gave him concern, and pledged to come up with a blueprint to develop the education and other sectors. Also, he said the nation’s security problem should be looked into from “a broader perspective,” as there are economic and political angles to Nigeria’s problem.
