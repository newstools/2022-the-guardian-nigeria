The Nigerian High Commission in the United Kingdom (UK) has expressed support for the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) by facilitating exposure of their services. This was one of the promises made when the Nigerian High Commissioner to the UK, Sarafa Isola, received a delegation of NCRIB led by the President, Rotimi Edu. The High Commissioner said that with Brexit, more windows of opportunities are opening for Nigeria to vigorously pursue business relationships with the UK. Isola expressed delight in the changing face and relevance of insurance to Nigeria’s national economic development, particularly, applauding insurance brokers for continuously enhancing the acceptance of insurance by many Nigerians. Also, the Chief Executive Officer, British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA), Steve White, has pledged to promote issues relating to insurance practice in the African market in BIBA’s yearly professional conference, held in Manchester, UK, adding that the organisers of the event may soon yield to the request for more inclusion of African issues in the fringe sessions. White agreed to sustain the relationship between BIBA and the NCRIB, particularly in the area of human capital development and expressed delight that the council had, over the years, made overwhelming representation at the forum. The President of the NCRIB, Rotimi Edu, appealed for the understanding and support of BIBA in bringing to the fore issues relating to insurance in Africa.
