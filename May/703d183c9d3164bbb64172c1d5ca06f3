Three governors of the southeast region, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Dave Umahi of Ebonyi state and Hope Uzodimma of Imo state on Thursday received President Muhammadu Buhari at the Akanu Ibiam International airport, Enugu. Buhari whose flight touched down t at 12.45 pm was on his way to Ebonyi state for a two-day working visit. At the airport also to welcome the president were former Governor of Ebonyi State, Dr Sam Egwu, former Governor of Enugu State, Sullivan Chime, Deputy Governor of Enugu State, Mrs Cecilia Ezeilo, Speaker of Enugu State House of Assembly, Edward Ubosi, Senator Uche Ekwunife and reps member Nkeiruka Onyejeocha, among others. Although the visit is expected to see Buhari commission some projects executed by Umahi, he would at the same time, hold an enlarged meeting with leaders and stakeholders of the southeast region. Sources said the president would use the meeting of Igbo leaders to receive reports on the security situation in the zone as well as the sustained agitation by the youths. Another source said part of what the Igbo leaders would present to the president during the meeting is the quest by the zone to produce his successor in 2023. Towards ensuring that the zone speaks with one voice, a meeting of Imeobi Ohanaeze Ndigbo has been convened in Enugu Thursday afternoon at the secretariat of the group.
