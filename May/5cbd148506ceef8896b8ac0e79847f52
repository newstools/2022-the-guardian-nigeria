Spurred by the ban of commercial motorcyclists in Ikeja, Surulere, Eti-Osa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa local councils by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, residents of Lekki, yesterday, called for permanent ban of  the operatives in their community.  “ Indeed, Okada has been an environmental nuisance all season and almost every resident has had a fair share of sheer recklessness of its riders as thousands of motorcycles are still in the hands of criminals who use them as the easiest means of meandering their way from security operatives while carrying out their activities.”
 
“It is an obvious fact that security within Lekki Phase One has deteriorated alarmingly,” he said.  “This time LERA will take every step to ensure the law banning ‘Okada’ from our roads by the Lagos State Government, is fully respected and strictly adhered to by all residents and the general populace at large,” Idowu added.
   
Idowu urther  commended Sanwo-Olu for throwing full his  weight towards protecting life and property of residents of Lagos State by re-imposing the ban on Okada in some Local Governments of the state (Ikeja, Surulere, Eto-OSa, Lagos Mainland, Lagos Island and Apapa), which will take effect from June 1.
