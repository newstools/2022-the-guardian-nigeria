• Says Nigeria Is A Failed State
• Urges Nigerians To Vote For Right Leaders In 2023 The Primate of Church of Nigeria, (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Henry Ndukuba, yesterday, said “Nigeria has moved from being a weak state to a fully failed state,” having manifested all signs of a failed country, including government’s inability to protect the citizens, large-scale violence and festering insurgency. Quoting recent report of Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and the Harvard Kennedy School in the United States (USA), Ndukuba warned that Nigeria’s failure as a state came with negative consequences for peace and security in the West African sub-region as well as Europe and the USA. Speaking at this year’s synod of the Abuja Diocese, the Primate said:  “Nigeria is fast becoming a land flowing with tears and blood. The reality of terror, devastations, destructions and fears that are evident. “We live in very uncertain times, insecurity and devastations. The troubles that come to the people are like the earthquake, which is followed by a Tsunami, with great destruction of lives and property. The aftermath is only ruins and fear for life… “The adverse foreign report on the state of our nation is corroborated by the increasing cases of attacks in villages, cities and the recent attacks in Kaduna Airport and Abuja-Kaduna train. We are constantly under attacks and in some parts of our dioceses, churches have been destroyed, members kidnapped, people are killed violently by unidentified gunmen. “Nigeria as a nation is at a point of no return. The country is in its last phase. The 2023 general elections Is an opportunity for Nigerians to exercise their right to choose good leaders. ” He encouraged every Anglican member to register, obtain and keep a voter’s card as well as National Identification Number (NIN)  to vote in next year’s general elections.
