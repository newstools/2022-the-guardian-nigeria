World Athletics has revealed that the next elite label road race on its calendar will hold on Saturday, May 28, 2022, in Okpekpe, Edo State of Nigeria. The event in Okpekpe, the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race, is coming after the success of yesterday’s TCS World 10K Bengaluru in India. The governing body for the sport on its label road race page on its website alerts the whole world to the fact that the next World Athletics elite label road race will hold in Nigeria. It is the only label road race in all label categories that will hold that day before the Kigali International Peace Marathon in Kigali, Rwanda and the Tartan Homes Ottawa International Marathon in Ottawa, Canada, which holds the next day. The Okpekpe race is returning after suffering two COVID-induced postponements in 2020 and 2021 and organisers have promised a better and bigger race this year to be in line with its new classification as an elite label race. The quality of elite athletes that will be competing for the top $20,000 prize money is the best so far assembled and will be led by Ethiopia’s Yasin Haji, who ran 27:00 under two months ago in Lille, France, to jump into the world top 10 lists of performances so far this year. Kenya’s Sandrafelis Chebet Tuei, who has improved her best from the 30.57 she ran in January 2018 to 30:45 last October at the 10K Valencia Ibercaja in Valencia, Spain, will also be in the cast. The race is organised by Pamodzi Sports Marketing, a leader in sports marketing, sponsorship, hospitality and rights acquisition business with operations in Nigeria.
