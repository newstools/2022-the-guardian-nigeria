A Senior Advocate of Nigeria and Professor of Law, Andrew Chukwuemerie, has sued the House of Representatives member, representing Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency of Bayelsa State, Hon. Preye Oseke, over alleged refusal to pay his professional fees for services rendered to him during the 2019 elections.
  
In two separate suits marked ABJ/CV/3403/21 and ABJ/CV/3404/21, before the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the claimant is seeking an order compelling the defendant to pay the balance of his professional fees.  In the second suit, which has to do with defending the lawmaker at both the Election Petition Tribunal and at the Court of Appeal also in 2019, the senior lawyer is claiming the sum of N20 million as outstanding professional fees, another N500, 000 as outstanding appearance fees, and the sum of N15 million as cost of the suit.
  
According to the claimant, the defendant had engaged him to defend his victory at the Election Petition Tribunal and the Court of Appeal in 2019.
  
The defendant had contested the seat of the Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency in 2019 under the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and won the election, which was challenged by his opponent.  But the defendant denied the first case and in the second disagrees with the figures.
