Emefiele has not refuted or confirmed the reports but said he was focusing on supporting the government’s efforts to strengthen the Nigerian economy. In a veiled reference to the ongoing campaign by Friends of Godwin Emefiele, a political group urging him to give the presidency a shot, and other associations mounting pressure on him, Emefiele in March 2022 said he is more interested in helping President Muhammadu Buhari finish well. “My focus at this time is a robust monetary policy and fighting inflation, which is now a global problem; building a strong financial system in an increasingly uncertain global economy, development finance and supporting farmers and manufacturers in our self-sufficiency and import substitution drive, raising N15 trillion for InfraCo infrastructure financing, building a world-class International Financial Centre in Lagos, as well as support the @MBuhari administration to finish strong,” Emefiele tweeted.
