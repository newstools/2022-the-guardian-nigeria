Ka3na made her intention known through a post shared on her social media pages on Wednesday. She shared a campaign poster of herself with the caption “THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG ABUJA #Ka3naForPresident #PresidentOfNigeria #APC #LetYourVoteCount #PeacefulElection” However, it is unclear whether the reality tv star truly intends to run for office or is merely chasing clout. Declaring her intention to run for presidency under the ruling party, All Progressive Congress (APC), it is important to recall that back in April, the party had announced that female aspirants for political offices would receive free nomination forms. Ka3na joins other celebrities, including Banky W, and Yul Edochie, who have declared their intentions to run for different offices in the 2023 general elections. Some Twitter users reacting to her declaration wrote: “Nigeria dun suffer na everybody wan rule this country” @Mbahdeyforyou. “Abg return the cat to the bag Make e dey there first” @OjadovbaP. “You have our full support. Am so proud and happy that you’re not sitting on your dreams but rather aiming for it. I want you to know that you have to cross many hurdles because people would like to rain you down but keep fighting. No matter how many times you fail never give up” @ChukwumaAngelC1. “Person wey no see Head of House win for BBN” @RayoKasali. “?” @the_Lawrenz. Ka3na was one of the housemate’s on BBNaija’s Lockdown edition back in 2020.
