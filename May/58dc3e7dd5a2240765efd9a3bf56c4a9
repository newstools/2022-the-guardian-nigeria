It has been 13 days since the defamation trial began and most of Johnny Depp’s testimonies have been heard. Depp is suing 36-year-old Heard, claiming that Heard’s 2018 op-ed she wrote for the Washington Post defamed him causing him to work setbacks and lose deals in Hollywood. However his agent confirmed that he was compensated for other films. Heard’s testimonies are expected to be heard today. The defamation trial has had over two dozen witnesses summoned by Depp’s attorneys, which had Depp himself taking the stand and witnesses testifying to the fights between Depp and Heard. The final witness called by Depp’s lawyers was forensic accountant Mike Spindler. Spindler testified on the magnitude of financial loss that Depp has to face since the 2018 op-ed, even though his name was not mentioned. “I concluded that Mr Depp suffered lost earnings of approximately $40 million,” Spindler testified. When that was over, Depp’s legal team rested its case, and Heard’s attorneys presented a motion to strike the case, insisting that the “Pirate Of The Caribbean” star did not prove his claim of defamation. Judge Penny Azcarate did not grant the motion on two bases, but she is willing to consider one other argument if Heard’s team can bring that forward as they present her case.
