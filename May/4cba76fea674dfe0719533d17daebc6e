Managing Director of Inq.Digital Nigeria, Valentine Chime, has stressed the need to encourage females to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) for sustainable development of the country.  The event is celebrated yearly to create a global environment that empowers and encourages girls and young women to consider careers in ICT.
 
At the 2022 STEM Future for Girls ceremony with the theme: “Access And Safety,” which was attended by regulators, private sector operators, women STEM leaders in Nigeria, academics and policy makers, the speakers harped on safeguarding girls and young women to thrive and participate in STEM as a way to closing the equality gap in the sector.
 
Chime noted: “It has never been more expedient for girls and women to embrace technology as a career path and inspire the next generation of female technologists.”
 
He stressed the significance of women’sinvolvement in STEM fields and the company’s commitment and focus on recruitment of women into technical roles within the organisation. The MD went on to say that Inq.’s support for initiatives such as Girls-in-ICT Day, which helps to highlight this essential purpose, is to build a world in which there would be no gender discrimination when it comes to the progress of STEM fields.
