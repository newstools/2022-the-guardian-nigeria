The actor criticised the AMVCA’s 8th edition, held at the Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos, for excluding actors from the Southeast. The star-studded awards had A-list stars like Funke AKindele, Stan Nze, Ramsey Nouah, Broda Shaggi and Osas Ighodaro in attendance, carting away a series of awards. According to Stanley Nweze via his Instagram, noted that the awards did not include actors from the Southeast, which has many films shot in Asaba and other parts of the eastern Nigeria. He also added that since the awards, which celebrates the creatives, was not diverse enough to recognise actors in the east, he suggested that the AMVCA should rather be called Lasgidi/Lagos. Stanley Nweze’s post read, “AMVCA ‘African Magic Viewers Choice Awards’ sincerely should be changed to Lasgidi/Lagos awards or something else because there are a lot of good actors and crew members in other areas under the same Nollywood working really hard that you all don’t recognize.” Stanley Nweze is known for his roles in Big Mess, A Lonely Lane, Strange Sisters and more.
