Members of the Petroleum Tanker Drivers Association (PTDA), an arm of the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), Ore Unit, have threatened not to allow any tanker carrying fuel supply to Ondo and Ekiti states to leave the depot until the leadership crisis is resolved. Besides, the tanker drivers insisted on closing the office to demand for fresh election that would usher in new leadership for the association. They hinged their decision on the refusal of the leadership of the union to vacate their positions after spending eight years at the helms of affairs. The PTDA members alleged that the zonal leadership of the association in Warri collected a N10 million bribe from the Ore Unit leadership to enable them stay permanently in office without election. A former chairman of Akure Branch, Akintomide Olatuja, who spoke with journalists in Akure, said the leadership of Warri Zone had threatened not to allow any tanker carrying fuel supply to Ondo and Ekiti states to leave the depot. He said:  “We have petitioned the commissioner of police and others on the matter. What we are demanding is that election should be conducted and nothing else. After the whole saga, the commissioner of police invited the two parties and settled for us. “We agreed that the zonal leaders will come from Warri and address us. We were still waiting since then. “We are saying that unless election is conducted, we will not allow them to go into this office. Some of them in the executive have spent 16 years. Just 10 of them are holding over hundreds of us ransom.”
