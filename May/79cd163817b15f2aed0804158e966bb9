Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has approved business support for striving small businesses within the state, to improve their business legal identity and compliance, as well as boosting of their businesses with proper structure. While announcing the news in a closed door meeting with the Chief Executive Officer of the Ondo State Entrepreneurship Agency (ONDEA), Dr. Summy Smart Francis, who also doubles as the Special Adviser to the Governor on Entrepreneurship Development, the governor also approved the payment of Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) registration for 1,000 businesses within the state. During the meeting, the agency CEO disclosed that the major challenges stopping entrepreneurs from accessing grants, loans and other forms of financial help for their businesses are two fold, which includes lack of knowledge and lack of proper business structure. He said: “As a result of these factors, a lot of small businesses have remained grounded and are unable to look beyond the government for help. “According to the mandate of Mr. Governor’s administration to create massive jobs through entrepreneurship, it is important that the government supports as many small businesses as possible even as ONDEA continues to equip them with knowledge and skill set to build and scale their businesses sustainably. “Entrepreneurs across the state have ample access to this opportunity. More information on how to benefit will be made available on the agency’s official website (www.ondea.ng).”
