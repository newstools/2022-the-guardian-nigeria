 Davido. Photo Idris Dawodu for Guardian Life Davido has released his highly anticipated single Stand Strong, the first track off his forthcoming album.   OBO featured The Samples Choir, the group behind Kanye West’s Sunday Service movement, on his new track. The Pheelz produced single is a lot different from the fast dance tempo sounds the Fall crooner has come to be known for. On Wednesday, Davido shared a teaser of Stand Strong on his Instagram, writing, “This one is special to me. It’s different. The conception has been different. The mindset has been different. The making has been different. I know you love it when I make you dance, but now I want to make you feel. This one’s for everyone out there holding it up. I know what I’ve experienced the past 10 years, and alot of you have been through it all with me. But… have you really? For the first time I want to bring you into the other part of my world.” “The part where every day is a battle, but I have no option but to STAND STRONG. I present to you the first single off my next album.” Mixed reactions have, however trailed the song’s teaser. While some argue that it is a sham attempt to win a Grammy, many others have pushed that it is a testament to Davido’s versatility and a worthy addition to this discography. Listen to Stand Strong:
