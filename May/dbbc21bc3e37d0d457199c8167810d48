Former chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ntufam Edim Inok, has berated National Assembly members, accusing them of using their oversight functions to enrich themselves. Inok made the allegation, yesterday, while briefing journalists in Calabar on his aspiration to represent Calabar/Odukpani in the Federal House of Representatives. He said: “I know the expectations of that office and what it should deliver. It’s not oversight function. “That’s why our people cannot bring back dividends to the people because they are lobbying for one viable committee and pushing for budget. That’s not why the people want them to go and represent them. You give quality representation by bringing the dividends to people not by enriching your pocket.” “Oversight function is your pocket. The first thing you do is to know why you are there which is the primary function – making the laws, supporting the bills and bringing projects that will enhance and empower your constituency, like road infrastructure and education.” Inok, who was also the state chairman of the PDP before defecting to APC, the National Assembly office had to do with competence and loyalty to the people.
