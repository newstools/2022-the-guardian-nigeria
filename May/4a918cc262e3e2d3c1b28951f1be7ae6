Nigeria’s minister of state for education Emeka Nwajiuba has resigned his position. Nwajiuba tendered his resignation on Wednesday after President Muhammadu Buhari issued a directive for all ministers and aides seeking elective offices next year to resign. The former lawmaker is seeking the presidential nomination of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the upcoming general elections. Others expected to resign from the cabinet include Attorney-General Abubakar Malami, transport minister Rotimi Amaechi, Niger-Delta minister, Godswill Akpabio, labour minister Chris Ngige, science, and technology minister Ogbonnaya Onu, mines minister Uche Ogar, and women affairs minister Pauline Tallen. Section 84 (12) of Nigeria’s amended electoral act states that “no political appointee at any level shall be voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.”
