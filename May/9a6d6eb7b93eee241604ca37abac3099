Governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections in Enugu State, Dr. Peter Mbah, has dismissed, as ‘fake, wicked and evil,’ news about his assassination, being peddled in the social media by unknown people. Mbah, in a statement, yesterday, signed by Mr. Dan Nwomeh on behalf of his media office, said that he is currently in Abuja after attending the PDP presidential primary election, concluded Saturday night. He urged members of the public to ignore the fake news, advising the masterminds to play politics of moderation and sportsmanship. The statement titled, ‘Fake news on the assassination of Dr. Peter Mbah,’ reads: “We have been inundated with calls over a fake news in circulation on some social media platforms about purported assassination of the Enugu PDP governorship flag bearer, Peter Mbah. “The story is false, wicked and evil. “Our investigations indicate that the story was doctored from the video of the gruesome assassination of one Professor Samuel Ndubuisi, the Director General of the Science and Equipment Development Institute (SEDI), along Enugu Port Harcourt expressway, two years ago. “It is the mere coincidence of ‘Ndubuisi’ in the two names that has been twisted by some devious and malevolent characters to spread unfounded panic and alarm amongst our supporters and well-wishers in Enugu and beyond. “We condemn this wicked and ill-conceived misinformation and urge the masterminds to play politics of moderation and sportsmanship, have the fear of God and develop respect for the sanctity of human life.”
