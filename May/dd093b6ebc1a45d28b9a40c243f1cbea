President of the Ijaw National Congress (INC), Prof. Benjamin Okaba, has described the outburst of the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, as unfortunate, adding that his comments shows that those, who ordinarily should be at psychiatric hospital, are in the corridors of power. Okaba, in an interview in his office in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, stated that when a man quarrels with virtually everybody in the country, it shows that his either influenced by alcohol or ungodly spirit. He said the INC had made their position clear on the arrest of the member of the House of Representatives, Farah Dagogo, saying that due diligence should be followed in the case. He said, “I think we have made our position very clear, which is that due diligence should be applied in addressing the issue. The utterances of the Governor of Rivers State before the arrest clearly portrayed some elements of victimisation.” “On the governor’s outbursts that ‘thunder should fire INC and IYC’, we don’t consider it very seriously because by making such very careless and unguarded utterances in a place that is supposed to be sacred (church), it tells you how backward we are as a nation where people, who should be in psychiatric hospitals are occupying the corridors of power.” Okaba equally spoke on insecurity creeping into South South, saying the Ijaws had raised the red alert, for every Ijaw man to be security conscious. “We raised what we call red alert for we to be security conscious, the intelligence we have gathered so far clearly state that urgency  and as I speak we are already taking steps because the Ijaw people cannot remain in a place and  allow hoodlums in any guise come and misbehave.”
