In the film’s trailer, Sandler plays Stanley Sugerman, a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers who dreams of being an NBA coach. To achieve his dream, he travels the globe in search of the next best talent at the expense of spending time with his family. He struggles with juggling his demanding job while trying to be there for his family, wife (Queen Latifah) and their daughter. While on the road, Stanley finds his diamond in the rough, a streetball player with a troubled background (played by real-life NBA player Juancho Hernangómez). The two bond over their shared passion for sport and their families. The inspirational underdog film, directed by Jeremiah Zagar, also stars Heidi Gardner, Robert Duvall, Kenny Smith, Anthony Edwards and Tobias Harris. NBA basketballer LeBron James serves as a producer on the film. Hustle debuts on Netflix on June 8. Watch the official trailer for Hustle HERE:
