 Ryan Reynolds Photo Varity Fair Ryan Reynolds has revealed that Denzel Washington takes punches like a pro.   The Canadian actor speaking with David Letterman on the Netflix series, My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman” made this revelation. Reynolds revealed that he had accidentally punched Washington, leaving him with two black eyes while filming their 2012 action flick, Safe House. When the incident occurred, the two actors were filming a catfight sequence in Cape Town, South Africa. Reynolds explained that it was the second day of shooting, and as they were fighting “in an out of control car”, he was supposed to “smash” Washington in “the face.” “There’s a scene in the movie where he crawls through the trunk in the back, and he grabs me and chokes me. We were really driving a car at top speed,” Reynolds said. “He and I are in this out-of-control car, and my corner of my head — I felt it hit his eye so hard I was sure that it split wide open.” Reynolds also joked about fearing that he would be fired for hurting Washington. “I’m thinking I’m going to be sent home via crematorium, like, this is it, not only my career but my actual pulse will cease.” But Washington politely told Reynolds he was OK. “He was fine; he was like, ‘Hey, accidents happen. Let’s do it again, and we’ll shoot it from the other side so we can keep shooting, so you don’t see this,'” the Deadpool actor said. Reynolds also revealed that the second punch hit just as hard. “We did it again, and I got the other eye, Dave,” Reynolds told the late-night host. “For a minute, he looked like a Christmas ornament.”
