In the light of $LUNA crashing by 98% within 24 hours, many crypto investors are growing sceptical of the major cryptocurrencies. The investor base is showing a heightened interest in the new tokens that are set to launch with evolutionary features. These updated features have the potential to revolutionise the crypto market and provide investors with immunity against the volatility of the market. One of the best ways to invest in these cryptos is through their presale opportunities. A presale is when a crypto organisation sells tokens that are still in development before they are issued to the general public. The token presale’s objective is to either raise funds for the project’s early development or to support operations leading up to the ICO launch. Since the risks of investing in a token presale are much higher, the tokens are typically sold at a discounted value. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754714 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Presales-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Presale should not be confused with an ICO (Initial Coin Offering). A token presale is held prior to the start of an ICO. The most pronounced benefit of investing during presales is the discounted value at which tokens are available. By investing low, the chances to earn high profits are multiplied as the tokens are claimed before they launch and start getting noticed by the general public. Other than just the token, you invest in a full-fledged project through presales. Your investment would go on to fuel technological developments and projects in the fintech industry. There have been cases of successful presales of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cryptonite (XCN). Such cryptos might have been purchased for $0.001 per coin at the ICO stage, then grown to $2.50 or more within two months after their exchange launch. Cryptocurrency presales are closed or sold out within a short period of launching due to high demand. That implies you’ll need to be alert whenever a fresh presale begins. The first step is to learn about upcoming token sales and ready-to-use cryptocurrencies. This is where personal research becomes essential. Community forums, on the other hand, are a brilliant opportunity to learn more and connect with people who can offer helpful advice on previous presales and potential future ones. Calyx Token (CLX) has entered its second stage of presale after going through a successful first stage. This could be an ideal opportunity to dive away from the woes of the current crypto downward trend. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1754711 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Calyx-Token-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Calyx Swap, according to the Calyx whitepaper, will allow customers to receive the best token swap pricing. The swap allows token holders to switch between tokens in a single transaction. By utilising trade routing to source and merge numerous liquidity pools from decentralised exchanges such as Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Avalanche (AVAX), Calyx Token (CLX) would be able to keep gas fees low and transaction times short. It is well on its way to becoming a DAO which shall allow the investors to participate in the decision-making process that shall dictate the future of their CLX investments. Given the feasible features of the new tokens that are entering the market, presales seem like one of the best options to lock investments down in a secure manner.
