He said the agency’s Director General, Mr. Garba Abari, recently directed all state directorates and the FCT to intensify campaigns to sensitising Nigerians to the negative effects of preferring foreign goods over locally-made ones, a situation which has forced manufacturers to resort to deceptive branding of their products. He said: “It is the expectation of the National Orientation Agency that this round of campaign against preference for foreign products and services would help strengthen the dwindling Gross Domestic Product of the country, as a result of low patronage of local products, reduce employment rate, increase the value of naira and boost the Nigerian economy,” he said.
