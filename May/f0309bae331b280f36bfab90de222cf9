The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has asked Nigerians to prepare for another round of fuel scarcity after the government stalled the payment of a N500 billion bridging claim. IPMAN chairman in Kano, Bashir Danmalam, said the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority has not paid the money to fuel markets despite being notified. Danmalam said the failure of the NMDPRA to pay the bridging claim, also known as transportation claim, had forced many of its members out of business. He alleged that since the amalgamation of DPR, PEF and PPRA to NMDPRA, the agency had only paid independent marketers twice. “NMDPRA is responsible for the payment of bridging claims otherwise known as transportation claims,” Danmalam said. “Failure of the NMDPRA to pay the outstanding claims for about nine months, many marketers cannot transport the product because their funds are not being paid. “Despite the high price of diesel, they manage to supply the petroleum products nationwide. The resurfacing of fuel queues in Abuja is just a tip of the iceberg with regard to petroleum scarcity. “Out of 100 percent, only five percent of the marketers can supply the petroleum products because of the failure of NMDPRA to pay them.” Danmalam called on the federal government to intervene before the situation degenerated into a mother of all fuel crisis in the country.
