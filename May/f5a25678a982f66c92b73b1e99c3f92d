The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) has donated a 160-seater ultra-modern lecture hall to Federal Polytechnic Nekede, FedPolyNek, to improve finance studies in the institution. Speaking at the official commissioning and handover ceremony of the facility to the school management yesterday, CIBN President, Dr. Bayo Olugbemi, said the project was a product of the Linkage Agreement between CIBN and the institution. Olugbemi added that the project represented CIBN’s modest contributions to the development of banking and finance education in the country to complement the government’s efforts. According to him, the new lecture hall was one of the six pilot projects facilitated by CIBN across the six geopolitical zones in the country. He urged the school management, the students and other beneficiaries to use the facility responsibly and give priority attention to its maintenance “so that it can retain its functional utility and aesthetic value. “Permit me to use this platform to call on corporate entities and well-meaning Nigerians to join forces with the government to rebuild and revamp the educational system in Nigeria, as education remains the bedrock of any meaningful development.” Responding, the Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodimma, represented by his deputy, Prof. Placid Njoku, commended CIBN for the “legacy project” and assured that it would be put to good use. Uzodimma urged banking students and bankers alike on ethical conduct and professionalism, stressing that to succeed in the financial field, trust, integrity and dedication were essential. He also charged the school rector and management to ensure that the students acquired entrepreneurial skills through quality training to make them enterprising enough to stand on their own rather than seeking elusive white-collar jobs upon graduation.
