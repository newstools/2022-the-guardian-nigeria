The Kentucky rapper shared the album’s tracklist on Instagram, which includes already released singles Nail Tech and First Class. The 15-track album includes features from rappers Lil Wayne and Drake, singers Pharrell Williams, Justin Timberlake and Dua Lipa. Debuting at the N0.1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100, First Class secured Harlow’s first-ever solo No.1 spot. He teased the single on social media the week after his debut appearance and performance at the 2022 Grammys and released it the following week. What’s Poppin released in January 2020 off his EP Sweet Action launched Harlow into stardom and his first album, That’s What They All Say, which debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard charts later that same year, also featured the hit single.
