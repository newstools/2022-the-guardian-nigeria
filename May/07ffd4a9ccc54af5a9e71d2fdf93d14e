Download logo The Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Thomas Tayebwa, has gifted Shs 15 million towards the construction of Rushere Full Gospel Church.  Presiding at the fundraising on Thursday, 06 May 2022 at Hotel Africana, Tayebwa encouraged the guests to practice and live up to the expectations of their faiths by following the teachings. “If you are Christian, be a good Christian, if you are Muslim, be an outstanding one and while at it, please be humble,” he said. Tayebwa said it was important to espouse humility regardless of what position of leadership one held in society and added that it starts with one accepting that they are not perfect. “In my interface with the Pope, I find it quite humbling that he always asks me to pray for him yet it should ideally be the other way round,” Tayebwa revealed. The construction of the 1,000-seater church, located in Kiruhura district, western Uganda is expected to cost Shs460 million.
