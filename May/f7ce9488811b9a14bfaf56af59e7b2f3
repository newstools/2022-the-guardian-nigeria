Grace Ofure foundation has stressed the need for youth empowerment to stem crime in the society. Founder of the foundation and Managing Director of Lifecard International company, Grace Ibhakhomu, made the call during an outreach, with the theme: ‘The Grace Awakening in Lagos”.  “The reason we have a lot of crime is because the youths have wrong role models, so the more people come out that we can trace their stories, then youths would be courageous to make right decisions, “ she said.
  
According to her, youths should be encouraged on their ability to create jobs, which comes to play when they focus on solving societal problems rather than wait to be employed. The foundation provided basic things like free medication, eye check and glasses, malaria drugs, food for a thousand people, while educating them on business tips.  Her words: “More than 100 women would receive at least 100 dollars depending on their business project as support for their business after the six weeks mentorship programme. “We are also providing food support for the next six weeks for those taking up the free empowerment. We don’t want the beneficiaries to dip their hands into the business grant to solve household issues.” She stressed that the empowerment, which kicked off this week, would support women in any field of their passion.
 
“Business is not how much you have. I didn’t start a business with capital, but I know that’s not everyone’s story, so I will tell them the importance of capital and putting in structures and processes, customer relations. We would help them grow the money,” she stated.
