Detectives of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command have in an intelligence-driven operation, arrested six suspected drug peddlers and recovered hard drugs and large quantities of prohibited substances in Abuja. The suspects; Suleiman Abdulrahman Bello, 27, Jonathan Joseph, 35, Suleiman Shamsudeen, 22, Emeka Offor, 29, Tanko Abdullahi, 20 and Luka Ishiaku, 25, were arrested in a tactical sweep operation by the Command’s Anti- Narcotic unit at different black spots within the territory.
    
According to spokesperson for the Command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Josephine Adeh, the suspects were found in possession of large quantities of dry leaves, suspected to be cannabis sativa of different variants like Loud, Arizona, crack cocaine and bottles of codeine syrup. He said:  “When interviewed, the suspects stated that they have been in the peddling business for quite a while. The investigation has been intensified to unravel other groundbreaking revelations that could lead to more arrests, while the suspects have been handed over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).” The FCT Commissioner of Police, Babaji Sunday, while frowning on the rate of moral decadence in the society, noted that crime variants are catalysed by drug/substance abuse and poor upbringing. He, therefore, called on all at the apex of religious and societal spheres of influence to maximize their platforms to preach against drug/substance abuse and other deviant behaviors. “The Command  urges good people of the FCT not to relent in cooperating with the Police, to remain vigilant, and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the Police through the following emergency lines: 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653, and 08028940883, While the Public Complaint Bureau (PCB) desk, could be reached on: 0902 222 2352.”
