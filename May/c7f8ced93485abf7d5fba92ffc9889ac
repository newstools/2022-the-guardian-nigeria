Following the resignation of Asanka Gurusinha, the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) has reshuffled the portfolio of national coaches to fill the gaps created by the Sri Lankans’ exit. This affects both the men’s and women’s teams. Gurusinha, who was the senior men’s team coach and High-Performance Manager for the country since December 2020, resigned last month on health grounds. The change sees Uthe Ogbimi return as senior men’s team coach. He will be assisted by Tamuno John-Harry, while Leke Oyede resumes the role as senior women’s team coach, with Theophilus Ibodeme as his assistant. The immediate past national women’s coach, Onome Oghenekevwe, will take up a new role as national U-19 Women’s coach to be assisted by Yusuf Awobola and Azuka Nwojiobi. The NCF said all the appointments are effective immediately and will be for a period of six months.
