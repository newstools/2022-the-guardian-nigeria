The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has advised the General Supritendent of the Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi, to cancel the planned crusade in Abia State, because of security concerns in the South East. In a statement, yesterday, the group’s Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful, cautioned Kumuyi to take note of the security situation in the South East as he comes to Aba for his gospel crusade. Powerful said: “Let him and the organisers of the crusade make sure that nothing happens. The security of this region is not good, because of political and criminal activities; therefore, we advise him to stop this crusade for security reasons. “IPOB will not allow anyone to die because of this crusade scheduled to hold in Aba. The operation of criminals operating as unknown gunmen infiltrating the events is high and they will blame it on IPOB. “We ask him to pray for an end to the insecurity in Biafra land if he can. We charge Christians and men of God in Biafra land to engage God in fervent prayers to expose all those behind the insecurity in our land.”He urged the pastor to pray against bad leaders and saboteurs in the South East and Nigeria. The statement added: “Let him use the opportunity to pray against the powers holding the people captive in Nigeria in his church in Lagos. “We equally want them to be united against injustice. We had expected them to demand justice for the innocent Deborah Yakubu, burnt alive by Muslim fanatics in Sokoto State. Her killers are walking freely today and 34 lawyers shamelessly volunteered to defend her killers, but Christians are just watching them.”
