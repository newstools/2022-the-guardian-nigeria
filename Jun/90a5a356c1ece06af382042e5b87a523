• Mixed Reaction Trails World Bank’s Insistence On Its Removal
• CBN’s Programmes Drive Inflation, Will Plunge Economy Into Deeper Mess – Owoh
• Ife Lauds Apex Bank’s Support For Productive Sector
• Urges FG To Privatise 20% NNPC Stake To Fund Budget With President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration inching to its twilight, a major assessment of its economic performance came last week in the form of the World Bank Nigeria Development Update (NDU) with a focus on the administration’s near misses and key policies that had under-developed the country.  “When other countries talk about subsidy, it is about helping companies, including public enterprises, to maximise their profits. But the subsidy is equal to fraud in Nigeria. Nobody understands what is being subsidised. This is the argument that has been made and we don’t need to wait for the World Bank to tell us how inefficient it is,” he said.
 
Owoh also aligned with the Bank’s position on CBN’s development financing. The economist expressed the belief that the interventions are major drivers of the country’s inflation, which currently stands at 17.7 per cent, and warned that they would plunge the country into a deeper economic mess.  The World Bank report said the CBN development financing made up 10 per cent of the total credit of the banking sector as at end of last year.
 
The World Bank warned that escalating prices of essentials and the shock from the crisis in Europe would push additional seven million Nigerians into poverty at the close of the year.  Ife argued further that forex restriction of some agricultural raw materials influenced the urgent need by the bankers’ banks to fund local substitutes to strike a balance and prevent a total collapse of the economy. 
 
He hinted that the government has given more money to the agriculture sector than the country has done in the last 20 years, saying over 4.8 million farmers have got loans without collateral.
 
“Only one trillion has been given to Anchor Borrowers Programme beneficiaries who have been producing the food we eat and there are complaints? I don’t understand that. More people would have died of hunger than COVID-19 and terrorism have killed if that programme was not introduced.”  “The fact on the ground today is that Nigeria still imports about 80 per cent of the rice it consumes. It is very funny how anyone thinks rice can be cultivated amid reigning insecurity in the country,” he stated.
 
Adigun also said the inputs such as fertilizers and other critical implements needed to engage in farming are not available.
