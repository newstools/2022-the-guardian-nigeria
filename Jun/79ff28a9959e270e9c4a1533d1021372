The Commandant General’s Special Anti-Vandal Monitoring Unit (SAVMU) of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has dislodged five illegal refineries at Obodo community creek in Warri North Local Council of Delta State. The creek served as a base where adulterated petroleum products are produced and distributed to users across the country. The operation was carried out following a tip-off on the nefarious activities of vandals and oil thieves operating a big camp with about five illegal refineries in the area. Director Public Relations, NSCDC National Headquarter, Abuja, Olusola Odumosu, in a statement, yesterday, said two suspects were arrested during the operation, while other collaborators remained at large. He said: “Intelligence report, however, revealed that the site belongs to three individuals, which consist of one woman and two other men currently in NSCDC custody and are volunteering information to assist in carrying out further investigation.” Also, the Squad Commander, Deputy Commandant Corps (DCC) Brah Umoru Samson, who led the operation, assured Nigerians that the SAVMU will not condone any act of sabotage to the economy and therefore warned all illegal operators to engage in a legitimate business that will not contravene the law or compromise the safety of critical national assets and infrastructure in the country. According to him, the illegal refineries and other equipment used for the illicit business have been destroyed, while an investigation will be carried out with due diligence to unravel other criminals connected to the crime for possible prosecution. He added that the arrested suspects would be prosecuted according to extant law, while the squad will ensure a manhunt for those currently on the run.
