An early morning fire yesterday, gutted an Ikoyi house of a former Chief Judge of Lagos State at 14 A, Ilabere Road, Ikoyi. Residents said the fire broke out in the storey building at about 8:00.a.m. and forced the former CJ to relocate abruptly. Eyewitnesses said efforts by officers of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), prevented it from causing further damage. No casualties were recorded in the incident, while fleet of cars around the compound were also not torched. Though, both the Permanent Secretary of LASEMA, Dr. Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu and the spokesperson for the agency, Nosa Okunboh, refused to disclose the owner of the building, residents claimed it belongs to a former CJ of Lagos State. When The Guardian visited the scene, the fire had spread to the adjoining building at 14B before it was put out. The Guardian also met the residents of the building outside the apartment, while police officers guiding the house were asked to close the gate and never allow anyone to have access to the building . It was discovered that the domestic workers were already moving luggage out of the building. A resident, who pleaded anonymity, said: “The house belongs to the former Chief Justice of Lagos and the fire was caused by a power surge. Responding to the incident, Dr. Oke-Osanyintolu said: “The agency activated its response plan to the above location at around 0800hrs this morning (yesterday). “A combined team of LASEMA Response Team, (LRT) and the Lagos State Fire Service managed to extinguish the residential fire and prevented it from spreading to adjoining properties.”
