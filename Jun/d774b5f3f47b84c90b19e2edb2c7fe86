The first trailer was released, and it gave a glimpse into the antihero’s backstory. Black Adam is a mythical North African nation from which he was imprisoned for 5,000 years in the comics. He receives his capabilities from the same old wizard that gave Shazam his lightning abilities. According to the teaser, the film version of Black Adam must choose between being a hero or a villain, and based on his response to the topic of whether heroes kill people, it appears that he chooses the darker road. Black Adam characters feature Noah Centineo who plays Atom Smasher, Hawkman is played by Aldis Hodge, Adrianna Tomaz is played by Sarah Shahi, Cyclone is played by Quintessa Swindell, and Doctor Fate is played by Pierce Brosnan. The trailer showed archaeologists electrocuting Black Adam with a bolt of lightning in the DC fandom. The cloaked figure quickly reduces a man to dust, stops a gunshot in mid-flight, and then flees. Following Black Adam, Zachary Levi’s boyish superhero returns in December with Shazam: Fury of the Gods. Aquaman and the Flash will have sequels in the coming year. Watch the trailer here.
