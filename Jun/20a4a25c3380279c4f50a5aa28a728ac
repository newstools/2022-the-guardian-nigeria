The coalition of youth groups under the All Progressives Congress (APC) has disagreed with the decision of the eleven governors over their decision on power shift to southern part of the country. The groups, APC Progressives Youth Elements and North East Youth Forum of APC while protesting in Bauchi, said that the power must not be shifted to southern part, saying that the governors were selfish in their positions. During a peaceful demonstration, members of the group were seen holding placards with different inscriptions like; “It’s North or Nothing”, “we are not in support of power shift to south”, ” we will not accept the decision of 11 governors”, “it’s their selfish interest”, etc insisted that North is left behind in the scheme of things. The President of APC Progressives Youth Elements, Alamin Bala Mai’auduga said that “we the action of the 11 northern governors to support any southern candidature, we the Northern youths do not think it is time for any southerner to assume the mantle of power. “It is on their selfish interest, we the Northern youths who are about 70 percent of the total population of the country are saying no. We are calling on our able National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu to weigh into this and find lasting solution to this. We are not going to support any southern candidate. These eleven governors that made the decision are not the only people in the North. They are doing it on their own selfish interests,” he said. Ibrahim Hashim Abdullahi, the leader of the APC Youth Forum alleged that the governors opted for such option to probably benefit from being appointed as vice president. He lamented that with the region’s hunger, insecurity, and poverty, the power needed to be retained for development. “We will not endorse any candidate from the South, except from the North. We are far left behind,” he said.
