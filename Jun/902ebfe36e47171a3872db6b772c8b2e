A house of Representatives aspirant for Obafemi Owode/Odeda and Abeokuta North Federal Constituency seat under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Samuel Abiodun-Oni, has petitioned the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, that the primary, which ought to have been conducted a week ago, is yet to take place. Abiodun-Oni stated this in a letter to Ayu, urging him to intervene urgently. He said: “Mr. Chairman sir, you may direct the conduct of the primary election at the already published venue in accordance with electoral guidelines of the party. “In the alternative, I should be declared the winner of the primary election as the party’s candidate.” “We implore you to use your good office to do the needful as we may be forced to approach the court for the enforcement of our fundamental rights. This letter also serves as pre-action notice.” Meanwhile, chairmen of the party in Obafemi-Owode, Odeda and Abeokuta North local councils, including Sunday Akinlabi, have written a letter to Ayu to officially report that the three local councils could not conduct primary for the House of Representatives seat.
