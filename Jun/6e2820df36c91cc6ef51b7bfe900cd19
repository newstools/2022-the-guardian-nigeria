Concerned citizens of Etua in Delta State have decried the detention of their members by the Police weeks after their arrest. They called on President Muhammadu Buhari, Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, Director General of State Security Service (SSS), Mr. Yusuf Magaji Bichi and Delta State Commissioner of Police, Ari Muhammed Ali, to release the detainees or charge them to court with immediate effect in accordance with the law. According to the group, it is wrong and unlawful to keep them in detention in perpetuity as every citizen is presumed innocent until the contrary is proven. It was gathered that the police invaded the community on May 21 at about 3:00 am in a Gestapo operation, shot one person dead, four were injured, while over 15 persons were arrested.  Contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Bright Edafe, said: “I’m not aware of the matter.”
