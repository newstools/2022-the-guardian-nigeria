Federal High Court sitting in Asaba, Delta State has fixed June 17 for ruling on the preliminary objection in the suit filed by Prince Efe Henry Duku challenging the N150 billion loan facility obtained by the Delta State Government. This followed arguments on the preliminary objection raised by the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Delta State, Mr. Isaiah Bozimo, on behalf of the government and Ekeme Ohwovoriole, on behalf of the Delta House of Assembly, who are defendants in the suit. When the case came up for hearing, on June 1, Bozimo, who led other lawyers, told the court the plaintiff lacked the requisite locus standi to Institute the action. Counsel for the state House of Assembly, Mr. Ekeme Ohwovoriole (SAN), also toed the same line by challenging the locus standi of the plaintiff and urged the court to dismiss the suit. Responding to both applications, counsel for the plaintiff, Michael Ukusare, submitted that the plaintiff had the requisite locus standi to institute the action as the Fiscal Responsibility Act entitles him to bring the action. The presiding Judge, Justice Folashade Olubanjo, adjourned the case till June 17, for ruling.
