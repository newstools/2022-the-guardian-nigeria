The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has linked the frequent power outages experienced recently to inadequate gas supply, low power generation, system collapse, and vandalism.
   
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Eko Disco, Dr. Tinuade Sanda, during an engagement forum with customers at Itire, Lawanson, Idi-Araba, and Mushin, said the challenges that led to poor power supply is not peculiar to EKEDC, but noted that efforts were in top gear to improve its service delivery.
   
She assured that the company was working with the other industry stakeholders to ensure the challenges were reduced to the minimum.  Spokesperson of the company, Godwin Idemudia, said the management was keen on establishing a closer relationship with customers across its network, hence the engagement forums.
 
He noted that the engagement was the third forum since Dr. Sanda assumed duty as MD/CEO of EKEDC following the ones held for customers in Ijora and Ojo districts.
