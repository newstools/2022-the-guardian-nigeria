The singer’s former brother-in-law Roberto Garcia has said he knows the truth. According to Garcia, an ex-boyfriend of one of Shakira’s sisters, Pique and Shakira’s issues started over money. He asserted that Pique had requested Shakira for a loan so he could use the money to invest in other businesses, but the children’s mother declined to do so since her parents advised against it. According to what a source very close to them has told me, there has been an economic issue between the two, Garcia told Spanish media outlet EsDiario. Piqué is said to have approached Shakira for money to help with an investment problem. “They don’t mix their money, and they keep the family economy at 50%.” He added, “Shakira fixed on Piqué because she liked him to be the father of her children. She knew she would never marry him.” Shakira and Pique, who started dating in 2010, ended their romance in June. Milan and Sasha are the couple’s two sons.
