Clarkson made this revelation speaking on Apple Music’s “The Global Chart Show with Brooke Reese” on Wednesday. She said, “Everybody knows the huge divorce I went through, and it’s been, like, two years and not easy with kids.” When asked for details on her next album, Clarkson explained how the divorce affected her career. “I’m just navigating what I’m comfortable with releasing,” she said. “So, it’s just a hard thing to navigate. It’s coming. I just got to get my crap together. I just got to figure out what I’m going to release. I’ve never had this difficult of a project.” While Clarkson has not released non-holiday music since 2017, she recently released a “Kellyoke” EP based on the smash segment of her daytime talk show, “The Kelly Clarkson Show”, after over 500 covers since 2019. Six studio versions of popular Kellyoke covers, including Billie Ellish’s “Happier Than Ever” and Whitney Houston’s “Queen of the Night,” are included on the EP. In June 2020, she filed for divorce from Blackstock; after nearly seven years of marriage, however their divorce was not finalized until March 2022. She also legally changed her name to Kelly Brianne in the same month. Explaining her decision at the time, she told People Magazine, “I just got divorced, so I had to drop my married last name.” “I just kept my middle name for my personal life. I’m still Kelly Clarkson,” she clarified.
