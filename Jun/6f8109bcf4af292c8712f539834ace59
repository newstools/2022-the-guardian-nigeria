Former international, Joseph Dosu, has said that Super Eagles newly-invited goalkeepers, Adewale Adeyinka and Adebayo Adeleye, will soon have opportunity to man the goalpost for the country. The duo did not get any chance to play in any of the friendlies against Mexico and Ecuador. But that will soon change, according to Dosu. Reacting to agitation by some fans, who want a total overhaul of the Eagles’ goalkeeping position following the team’s failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which they attributed to goalkeeper Francis Uzoho’s below par performance, Dosu said one single mistake does not define a goalkeeper. “Before the matches against Mexico and Ecuador, Maduka Okoye, who was earlier invited for the friendlies, had to excuse himself. That paved way for invitation of Adeleye and Adewale Adeyinka of Akwa United to the team. “Eagles new coach, José Santos Peseiro, may have ordered the invitation of Uzoho, who is a known face in the Eagles team in the past. Hence he had to keep for the team in order to regain his confidence, following his mistake that cost us qualification for the World Cup. “The coach may also have seen Uzoho as the person to man the post for the Eagles in the two friendlies due to what he saw in the camp,” he said. The Super Eagles former goalkeeper added, “the fact that the two new goalkeepers were not used during the friendlies does not mean they won’t also have opportunity to play in subsequent matches. “In the goalkeeping area, players would be given the chance to show what they can do. And it is now left for whoever that is given the break to prove himself.”
