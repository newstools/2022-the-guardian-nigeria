Torche, a Nigerian-based startup is poised to provide improved payment solutions in Africa through its biometric payment offerings where customers can process payments with their face or fingerprint. The firm reaffirms that the new biometric payment system will edge out the present POS technology and affords customers the latest payment technology system where they can make transactions with ease and convenience. “I think when you overlook a massive population, instead of digging deeper into building solutions for their problems, we won’t be able to uncover many situations that will also apply to the rest of the world,” the Chief Executive Officer of Torche, Sisan Dorsu, said. “We’re building Torche to give people the opportunity to evolve and achieve their full potential by making financial services accessible by simply being identified through their biometrics.” Sisan joins a growing number of female founders taking the reins in Nigeria’s burgeoning tech scene. Before building Torche, Sisan spent over 2 years at Accenture building innovation strategies for fortune 500 financial services companies. She returned to Nigeria and teamed with co-founders Gbenga Oni as Chief Technology Officer, and Fawaz Abaniwonda as Chief Operating Officer to build Torche. “The biometric-enabled solution is currently available at stores in Lagos, Nigeria, and will extend to more supermarkets, cafes, gas stations, etc in the coming months. “Torche is partnering with several banks in Nigeria to bring their solutions to merchants and customers. Torche’s number one priority is to ensure the security and privacy of each user’s data,” the company added.
