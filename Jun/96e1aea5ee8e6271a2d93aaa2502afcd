APC leader’s emergence will birth real democracy, says Yakasai
Former Speaker, House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, has urged Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Rotimi Amaechi and other All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants, who lost to Bola Tinubu at the presidential primary election to form a formidable force with the candidate. Dogara, in his congratulatory message to Tinubu, urged the aspirants to close ranks ahead of the 2023 general elections, which he describes as the surest way to victory. The eighth House of Reps Speaker, who campaigned for Tinubu, urged members to mobilise for the party’s victory.
BESIDES, frontline Northern politician, Tanko Yakasai, has described Tinubu’s emergence as an important political development that will lead to a full-fledged democracy. In a congratulatory message to the candidate, yesterday, Yakasai said: “When Tinubu, a sage, is eventually elected as the president of the country, history shall be made in our contemporary political development for a number of reasons. His victory will signify the total breakaway from military influence in our polity, which will bring about the return of the country to a full-fledged democratic tradition and practice for the first time since the return of civilian rule in 1999.” Therefore, it is important to appeal to all candidates vying for various political positions in the country to commit themselves to the principles of playing politics according to the rule of the game.”
