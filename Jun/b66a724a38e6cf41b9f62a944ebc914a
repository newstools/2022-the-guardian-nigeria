Debutants in para-sport at next month’s Commonwealth Games, Innocent Nnamdi and Jubril Ademola Popoola have promised Nigerians exciting times at the Birmingham 2022 edition of the competition, which holds from July 27 to August 7. Speaking to The Guardian at the flag-off of the 2022 Olympic Day celebration, Nnamdi and Popoola, said they are looking forward to registering their names in gold. Nnamdi, featuring in the 72 kg category of para-weightlifting, said despite the camp not opening, he has commenced serious training to keep himself in good shape for the Games. “This is my first participation in the Commonwealth Games and as you know, the camp has not officially opened. But on my own, I have been training hard at the National Stadium, pending when the sports ministry will declare it open. “My teammates and I have high expectations of performing well in Birmingham. I believe I will come out on top in my weight category. My target is to win a gold medal for my country in the para-weightlifting event,” he said. To Popoola, who is participating in the para-basketball team event, the fact that he is a first-timer at the Games will not stop him from winning a gold medal. “My ambition is to ensure that my team wins the gold medal, which will help create an awareness of the need to start a para-basketball league in the country. This is needed so that basketball athletes with disabilities will not go about begging for alms, as this will also take them out of joblessness,” he said. Popoola revealed that the para-basketball team had a training tour of some West African countries, where they featured in competitions as preparation for the Games.
