Nigeria’s leading stadium construction expert, Ebi Egbe, has declared his readiness to solve the problem of the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, turf. Egbe said all that the turf needs are the touch of an expert, who understands the pyrotechnics of what a modern stadium turf should look like. He stated that whatever money is pumped into the turf would go down the drain if it is not handled by a thoroughbred professional groundsman. “This is my sector and I know what I am talking about. Nigerians were not happy with what they saw on the pitch when we played Sierra Leone. It is said that the pitch is that way after all the money pumped into it by Dangote. I am ready to help as a patriotic Nigerian and I have always said my company, Monimichelle, is ready to partner both states and Federal Government to eradicate bad pitches in the country. The pitches we have done in the country are there for people to see. “From Aba, to Lagos, Katsina, Makurdi, Awka, Yenagoa and Remo, what we have done is there and our job speaks for us. I don’t compromise quality and as a nation, we should have the best of pitches in Abuja and Lagos,” he said. Egbe, who is the managing director of Monimichelle, said Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, has done well by getting Dangote and Baba Ijebu to renovate the stadia in Lagos and Abuja, adding, however, that the minister must move now to ensure that these business moguls are impressed with the jobs done.
