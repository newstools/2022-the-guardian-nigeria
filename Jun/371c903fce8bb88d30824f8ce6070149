The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has decried the high level of vandalism of telecommunication infrastructure in so many communities across the country. The commission also said it is imperative for the public to regard telecom facilities as collectively owned infrastructure that is essential for the provision of efficient and acceptable telecom services that must be keenly protected. The commission’s Director, Zonal Operations, Amina Shehu, stated this yesterday, during a one-day sensitisation programme on “Protection of Telecom Infrastructure”, in Dikko/Sabbon Wuse, Niger State. Shehu, who was represented by Assistant Director in the commission, Mr. Abubakar Usman, said: “Telecommunication has been an integral part of our daily lives with provision of services ranging from telephony, entertainment, information and learning over a broad range of media platforms. “These achievements would not have been possible without the active collaboration of all relevant stakeholders and the healthy enabling environment provided by government in the sector. However, much as we aim to sustain this growth and as the industry continues to evolve, we are faced with various challenges that have hampered development in the sector as it relates to infrastructure deployment. “Vandalism of telecom infrastructure has continued to be a major challenge in the telecom industry. However, the commission has continued to collaborate with the relevant agencies to ensure adequate security for telecom facilities”. He emphasized that over the past 15 years, the commission has experienced a tremendous and significant contribution to Nigeria’s GDP. In his remarks, the traditional head of Sabbon Wuse, Alhaji  Adamu Bako, assured NCC of his support to protect telecom infrastructure around the community.
