Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Simbi Wabote, has called for collaboration among stakeholders, including law enforcement agencies to ensure the target for the Local Content Act is achieved. Speaking at a sensitisation programme for law enforcement agencies at the local content towers in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, he said the level of Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry has increased to 42 per cent from five per cent in 2010, before the passage of the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act. With the theme, ‘Deploying Multi-Institutional Approach to Nigeria Content Enforcement in the Oil and Gas Industry’, the one-day  workshop drew participants from law enforcement agencies, including the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), among others. According to Wabote, the essence of the workshop is to ensure that NCDMB is able to bring in relevant stakeholders to support local content implementation and enforcement for a better result. In his welcome address, Naboth Onyesoh, head of legal services, NCDMB, said it was important that other agencies connected with economic activities understand what the mandate of the agency is all about so they can support to ensure compliance with relevant requirements within the oil and gas industry.
