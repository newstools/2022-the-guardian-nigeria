Gunmen kill pregnant woman, injure one Socio-economic activities were grounded for the second time in Enugu State, yesterday, following a sit-at-home order issued by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). On Monday, residents did not open for businesses due to the weekly sit-at-home observance. However, yesterday’s sit-at-home order was declared by the separatist group in solidarity with its leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, who appeared in court for the continuation of his trial. IPOB’s spokesperson, Emma Powerful, had, in a statement, on Monday, ordered that banks, schools, markets, shops should remain closed, while civil servants and other workers remain indoors as the court hearing lasted. He had said the sit-at- home was in solidarity with the leader of the group. As a result, businesses and several other activities did not open in the state, yesterday. Only few commercial and private vehicles plied the streets, even as the police and soldiers were seen in strategic locations during the lockdown in the state. MEANWHILE, tragedy struck in Akwuke, Enugu South Council, Monday, as gunmen stormed the area and killed a pregnant woman and a member of the vigilante. Also, a secondary school girl was hit by bullets fired by the gunmen and is now receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital. Sources said the gunmen stormed a relaxation spot at about 08:30pm and started shooting. While the owner of the joint was said to have escaped through the back door, his pregnant wife was pursued into the kitchen and was shot dead. SIMILARLY, economic activities in Owerri, Imo State, were grounded, yesterday, in obedience to the sit-at-home order. The streets of Owerri were empty.
