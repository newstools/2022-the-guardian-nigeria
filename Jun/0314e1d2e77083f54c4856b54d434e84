 Kanye West Chaney Jones Photo Public News Times Kanye West and Chaney Jones have reportedly split. TMZ reports that sources close to the former couple claim they split following their trip to Japan. However, it’s unclear who broke up with who. The news of their split comes as photos of Kanye at a movie with another woman popped up over the weekend. Kanye and Jones got together in February following his breakup with model Julia Fox. Soon after, Jones was spotted at Ye’s “Donda 2” events. After then, they were spotted in photographs together and eventually came public as boyfriend and girlfriend. Since his split from Kim Kardashian last year, Fox was Ye’s first relationship, and the couple solidified their status in a series of high-profile, staged photoshoots. One photo showed them canoodling and trying on clothes in a hotel suite surrounded by assistants, while another showed Fox dressed in an all-black custom leather outfit with echoes of her past as a professional dominatrix as she laid across a dinner table while Kanye pretended to tuck her in with a knife and fork. The couple’s whirlwind romance came to an end six weeks after. The 32-year-old actress explained that their split had nothing to do with the rapper’s spontaneous lifestyle and his “hectic” schedule. “It feels like you’re just going with the flow, but the flow is very hectic if that makes sense. It’s a lot of last-minute decisions or deciding to go somewhere at the last minute and activating when needed,” she said,” When I’m with Ye… But even when I’m with my son, it’s also very difficult.” However, Kanye did not speak about the end of his relationship with Fox and is yet to address his alleged split to Jones. Meanwhile, Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson’s relationship remains strong as the two stepped out together at the 2022 Met Gala Awards last month.
