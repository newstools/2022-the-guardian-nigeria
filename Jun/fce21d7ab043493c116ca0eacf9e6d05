Kebbi State Deputy Governor, Ismail Yombe Dabai (rtd) has appealed to those who lost out in the just concluded primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state not to decamp from the party. He made this appeal yesterday while fielding questions from newsmen in Birnin Kebbi, describing politics as a game of win and lose. He explained further that the idea of losing election and leaving a party was not a welcome ideology, urging members of the party who lost the primary elections to remain in the party as they don’t know what tomorrow could be. “I am going to remain in APC because it is the party we build together. I suffered for it. Is it because I lost that I would leave the party? No, I will not leave and I don’t want them to leave,” he said. Dabai commended the efforts of the national leadership of the party, the Kebbi State governor and other relevant stakeholders, who ensured the successful conduct of the primary. Dabai called on aggrieved members to eschew any political difference and join hands together to move the state and the country forward. “We should believe that it is God that gives and takes power. So, let us be together and move the state forward,” he added.
