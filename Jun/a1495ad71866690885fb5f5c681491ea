Ahead of GOtv Boxing Night 25, which will hold tomorrow at the Old Gymnasium of Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, Ibadan, boxers scheduled to fight have been talking tough. The show, regarded as Africa’s biggest boxing platform, will feature seven fights in different weight categories. Speaking from his base in Onitsha, Victor Bennet is upbeat about his chances of winning his lightweight bout against Segun ‘Success’ Olanrewaju. The Anambra ‘dynamite’ insists that Olanrewaju’s foreign experience will count for nothing when they face each other. “I know Olanrewaju recently returned from a fight in Russia, but that will mean nothing on Saturday night because I will beat him without mercy. I promise that his nickname will change to Failure,” he bragged. Responding to Bennet’s warning, Olanrewaju promised to teach him a big lesson in the ring. “Bennet has been running his mouth, but talk is cheap. I won’t talk too much. I will leave the rest to my fists,” he said. Meanwhile, heavyweight boxer, Solomon Imole, has said he can’t wait to crush Olanrewaju ‘Larry King’ Adebiyi against whom he is scheduled to fight. While reacting to Adebiyi’s eagerness to fight him, Imole said his opponent would end up regretting his decision to take on him. Also speaking ahead of his fight with Ibadan-based lightweight boxer, Samuel ‘Apata Roro’ Moses, lightweight boxer, Wale Anifowoshe has told his opponent to expect humiliation in front of his supporters.
