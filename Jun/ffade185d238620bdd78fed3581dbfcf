One of the presidential aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Pastor Tunde Bakare said he is not aware that he was unaware that the party’s leadership has shortlisted five candidates for its primary election. Bakare said he is confident of winning the APC presidential ticket and succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari whose second term will elapse in May 2023. “I went through the screening,” Bakare told Channels TV on Tuesday.  “I was cleared, and nobody told me that I have been disqualified in any shape or form.” “In an orderly society, if I apply to be a candidate and paid all the necessary fees, courtesy demands that you tell me that your name is not there,” Bakare, a Lagos-based pastor said. Amid a strong list of other persons including the vice president Yemi Osinbajo and former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu jostling for the ticket, Bakare doubled down on his prediction to Nigeria’s 16th president. “I carry grace. I carry favour. I carry God-factor. Give me the opportunity to speak with party delegates and you will see what will happen,” Bakare said. “The president is 15th and I’ll be number 16th.” The cleric, however, noted that he will congratulate whoever emerges as APC presidential candidate at the end of the convention.
