The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) independent gas-powered plant in Maiduguri, Borno State, will be completed by November 2022. Group Managing Director (GMD) of NNPC, Mele Kyari, disclosed in Maiduguri, yesterday, that machineries for the gas engines are already on site with the technical team to fix the equipment. The 50MW power project was sited along Baga road, following the destruction of three power tower lines near Jakana village on January 17, 2020. According to the GMD, the turbines to be installed are the best in the world with latest technology to produce electricity from gas. On sustenance of electricity, he said: “The Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) would be supplied to Maiduguri from Port Harcourt (Rivers State) by 22 trucks daily covering a distance of 1,700 kilometres,” adding that 57 trucks of gas will be adequate to power the plant for 10 years. The power plant undergoing engineering work will gulp over 5,000 metric tonnes of gas to be supplied by Greenville for 10 years. “By the time the Abuja, Kaduna and Kano gas pipeline is on stream, the journey be shorten from Kano to Maiduguri,” he said.
Kyari assured that Borno would have improved electricity and attract new manufacturers to open shops in Maiduguri. Members of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) in Maiduguri were also at the project site with NNPC engineers to assess the level of progress at the plant.
