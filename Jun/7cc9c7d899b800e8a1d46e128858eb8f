The sound of gunshots rent the air yesterday, in Idi-Araba, Mushin, Lagos when commercial motorcyclists, popularly known as Okada riders clashed with officials of Lagos State Task Force over enforcement of the state’s ban on their operations.
  
The tear gas shots and sound of gunshots forced many shop owners to close as early as 1:30 p.m. while residents scampered to safety.
 
The Guardian learnt that the Okada riders had tried to resist the  Task Force, who came in four-patrol vans from impounding their motorcycles around  Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) the area of Idiaraba, but were outnumbered and tear-gassed.
