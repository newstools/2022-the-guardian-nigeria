Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State, Augustine Nnamani, has disclosed that the emergence of Peter Mbah as the party’s governorship candidate is the choice of ‘Ndi Enugu’ following wider consultations, which involved not only Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, but also the party leadership, elder statesmen and traditional rulers, among others. The PDP state Chairman, who is an indigene of Isi-Uzo Local Council, gave the hint when the people of the council trooped out en masse to the Government House, Enugu, on a solidarity visit to Ugwuanyi for the unprecedented development projects his administration has executed for them. Led by Nnamani, the member representing Isi-Uzo Constituency in the state House of Assembly, Mrs. Amaka Ugwueze, the Chairman of Isi-Uzo Local Council, Obiora Obeagu, and other stakeholders, the people of the council also commended Ugwuanyi for the peaceful conduct of the PDP primaries in the state. The people of Isi-Uzo Council told the governor, who is the leader of the PDP in the state, that they accepted the outcome of the party primaries in good faith as loyal party men and women, and assured the governor of their full support and loyalty. Presenting their unanimous stance to the governor, the Chairman of Isi-Uzo Council, Obeagu, while listing the numerous projects of the Ugwuanyi’s administration in the council, said:  “From the time you assumed office as governor till date, Isi-Uzo Local Council has witnessed tremendous development.” The Council Chairman added that in the history of the state, no administration remembered Isi-Uzo in terms of development, human empowerment, political appointments, peace and security like the  Ugwuanyi’s administration, stressing that the governor constructed and reconstructed classroom buildings and other infrastructure in over 55 schools, built healthcare facilities, bridges, and roads, such as the 22km Neke-Mbu-Ogbodu Aba-Obollo Etiti inter-community link road and the 8.8km Nkalagu-Eha Amufu road in Isi-Uzo Local Council, which was neglected for over 35 years.
