The Coalition of Plateau All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and others, yesterday, staged a protest against alleged imposition of governorship candidate in the state by Governor Simon Lalong and the party leadership. The youths, who stormed the state APC Secretariat located on Kalwa House, along Yakubu Gowon Way, Jos, carried placards with different inscriptions, such as: “No to imposition of candidate. No to Lalong’s dynasty. Lalongs’s government is worse than that of Jang,” among others. They addressed youths in Plateau State, irrespective of their political affiliations. The chairman of the 18 APC governorship aspirants in the state, Chief Amos Gizo, told them that there was no election in APC in Plateau. He described their action as “a welcome development” because there were no known delegates during the purported delegate primary. “There was no primary in Plateau State APC to produce a governorship candidate,” he said.
