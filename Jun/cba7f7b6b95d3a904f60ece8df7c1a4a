Based on the outfit combinations we saw this week on social media platforms, it’s clear that some trends aren’t going away anytime soon, and the Nigerian fashion scene is quickly becoming a must-see. One of the reasons many Nigerians are glued to their phones is to find new ideas to influence and elevate their style. This is why they look at fashionable celebrities on social media for inspiration. And, to some extent, it is safe to say that these celebrities continue to set notable trends every week. Here are our top fashionable celebrities’ outfits for the week, ranging from street style to avant-garde. Erica Nlewedim: It is no surprise that this actress and influencer ranked first on our list, given the amount of creativity and professionalism that goes into each of her outfits. Erica looks regal and sophisticated in a dramatic metallic textured two-piece design, putting a new spin on beach wear.  Priscilla Ojo: When we think of a black dress, we often think of something cliche and boring. Priscilla, on the other hand, proves us wrong by striking a stunning pose in a black top and what can only be described as a glamorous slit skirt, serving us legs for days. Toke Makinwa: What is fashion without the multi-talented media personality, Toke Makina? Toke has a stunning supermodel look on her face as she wears a modern interpretation of a sweatshirt, paired with black shoes and a handbag that distracts us from appreciating her flawless skin.  Dinma Umeh: In a grey sleek and fitted suit, this media influencer puts the boss in “boss lady”. Chioma Ikokwu : While many people avoid bright colours, Chioma chooses to embrace them wholeheartedly. The reality star looks stunning in a yellow short sleeve jacket and a skirt, as she accessories with a pink mini bag. Soft made it: When he’s not dancing, you can always count on Soft to drop some drool-worthy street style fashion inspiration ideas. The content creator reminds us of why we look forward to his pictures every week in a striking green-white striped jacket and green shorts. Eronini Osinachim: The model sets a high standard for men who intend to wear orange in the near future. As if an orange sweatshirt wasn’t cool enough, he also wore washed-out black jeans and Nike sneakers. Tacha, Larry Hector, and Temi Otedola are some notable mentions.
