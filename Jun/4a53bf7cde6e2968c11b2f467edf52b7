Jordan from her Instagram days after the news of the couple’s split hit the media. While the former couple has unfollowed each other, Jordan, on the other hand, still has images of Harvey on his Instagram, including ones from their red carpet debut at Vanity Fair’s Oscars After-Party in March. A source informing People Magazine of the couple’s split last weekend revealed that they “are both completely heartbroken” and “still love each other” after breaking up. “Michael matured a lot over the course of their relationship and was ready to commit for the long term. He let down his guard with her, opening up emotionally in a romantic relationship for the first time,” the source added. “They had great times together and brought out the best in each other.” On Monday’s broadcast of long-running talk show “The Steve Harvey Morning Show”, Lori’s stepfather Steve Harvey stated his support for his daughter. “I’m team Lori, 1,000 percent. She’s my daughter. I love her, I support her,” he said. “Things happen,” he added. “It’s hard to be young and in the limelight and have a successful relationship. Look, as long as everybody can walk away in peace, be friends … I ain’t heard nobody say they busted no windows or nothing.” The couple’s split comes months after they celebrated their first anniversary back in November.
