Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has hailed his Delta State counterpart, Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the running mate to the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar. This is as Delta State citizens welcome the news with wild celebration.  Obaseki, in a statement, said Okowa’s emergence would translate to victory for the party in the forthcoming elections. “I heartily congratulate you, my friend and brother, His Excellency, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, on your emergence as the vice presidential candidate of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “An energetic grassroots mobiliser, Okowa, a two-time governor, senator and commissioner, has the needed experience that would guarantee victory for our party in 2023 elections in our bid to rescue the country and place it on the path of progress and prosperity. “As we embark on this all-important mission to rescue Nigeria, we must now all work together in unity as a people and party, to reclaim our country,” the governor charged. IN Asaba, there was palpable joy everywhere, including the state secretariat and government offices, especially among government officials and appointees.  “We are very sure of victory in the forthcoming general elections and we are going to embark on massive grass-roots mobilisation for the party and the presidential candidate and his running mate.”
   
The governor’s Senior Political Adviser, Funkekeme Solomon, said with the choice of his boss, a new dawn beckons, as it was the outcome of a rigorous process that had been the hallmark of PDP.
 
“Okowa has accomplished a lot in Delta State. He is a symbol of peace, fairness, development and rule of law. We are glad that he is in a position to re-enact these and more at the national level,” he said.
