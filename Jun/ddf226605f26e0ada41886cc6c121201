The Best African Medical Student at the Russian Centre for Scientific Research was suspended by Irkutsk State Medical University (ISMU) and evicted from the campus hostel after the Sokoto government failed to pay his overdue scholarship. The cash donation by Prof. Gwarzo, done through the Association of Nigerian Students in Europe (ANSE), was received by Adnan Mukhtar, Manager of PRNigeria Centre in Kano. The MAAUN Founder urged spirited citizens to quickly come to the aid of Yahaya to make sure that his “bright and promising future is not truncated”. “We have to do something to ensure that his education is not affected; that he is also not detained in Russia. The N1million and other expected donations will go a long way to rescue Yahaya”, he said. Bashiru Muhammad, ANSE President expressed gratitude for the gesture and appealed to the Sokoto government to swiftly resolve the student’s predicament. “We cannot appreciate Prof. Gwarzo enough. He has blazed the trail in the crowdfunding initiative for Usman Yahaya. It is hoped that other philanthropic Nigerians will follow suit”, he added. After the initial eviction, the Sokoto-born student was allegedly detained at a Russian immigration camp at Angarsk Irkutsk by the authorities. His travail was allegedly caused by a Sokoto State Scholarship Board official accused of pilfering substantial amounts from the government-approved bursary paid yearly since 2016. Yahaya has appeared twice at a Russian state court and, if convicted, may be expelled from ISMU, imprisoned or banned from the European country. Ms Elena Orel of the university’s International and Student Relations Department said the student was not forcefully detained nor the only one evicted over a visa violation. “He was moved to the immigration camp to seek asylum pending when he will be able to resolve the visa issue. There’s no form of humiliation or harassment from the authority, the student can move freely. “However, after receiving a letter from his sponsors in Sokoto, the student is currently housed in the university accommodation for safety. But if he cannot renew his documents, he may be deported,” Orel added.
