Joe Aribo has ended his season after no less than 70 appearances for club and country, reports rangersreview.co.uk. The Rangers midfielder endured a mammoth season at domestic and European, as well as international stage. Aribo, 25, ended his season as the most-used player on the plant – with 57 appearances for Rangers and 13 for the Nigeria national team. The Ibrox favourite shares the accolade with Guatemala midfielder, Stheven Robles – however, Aribo played more minutes throughout the season. Finally, with time to reflect on a non-stop season, Aribo admitted it was an ‘unforgettable’ year full of ‘ups and downs.’ Rangers lifted the Scottish Cup on the final day of the domestic calendar and made an impressive run to the Europa League final. But Aribo is ready to shift focus to next season already. Posting on Twitter, Aribo wrote: “Grateful to have played 70 games this season, I just wanna thank God for getting me through it. “A season full of ups and downs but unforgettable memories were created. “Can’t wait to get going next season thank you to all the fans for your continued support.”
