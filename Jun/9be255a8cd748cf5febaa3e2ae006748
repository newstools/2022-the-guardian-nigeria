As part of activities to celebrate the Children’s Day on May 27, the Ladies Section of Dolphin Golf Club, Navy Town Ojoo, Lagos, led by Mrs. Onwuegbu Bose Ngozi, engaged children in a funfilled golfing education, mini tournament and Ladies Kitty. The Lady Captain said the club is always conscious of introducing golf to the kids at their early stage, adding that in addition to etiquette and the ability to play comfortably with new acquaintances, golf also teaches self-confidence, improves the ability to work with numbers and applies problem-solving skills. “Golf is a great sport for young kids to get involved with. It helps them grow mentally and physically by keeping them healthy and teaching them life skills. A golf course is a great place for kids to meet new people, immerse themselves in healthy competition, and learn the value of patience and self-improvement. The most important aspect of golf is that it’s enjoyable and childhood is all about learning and having fun,” Onwuegbu said. In the Children’s Day programme, she said the kids were separated into two categories, ages one to six, and seven to 12, adding that exciting prizes were given to winners, as well as souvenirs for all the participants. Ladies of the club also joined their kids on the course in a kitty organised as part of activities to celebrate with the children. There were other fun activities for the children, which included face painting, bouncing castle and board games.
