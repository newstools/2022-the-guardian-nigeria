Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has commended Airtel Nigeria for its support towards under-privileged Nigerians, describing the telco as a role model to all.
 
The governor, who spoke during the premiere of the sixth edition of the company’s ‘Airtel Touching Lives’ programme last Friday in Lagos, lauded Airtel for being an example to individuals and organisations.
  
“Airtel is leading as an example for individuals and institutions. They have exhibited the true Lagosian spirit of working in unity, by joining the government in raising a sustainable nation… Therefore, as individuals and organisations, let us also make efforts to reach out and empower the less privileged as Airtel is doing,” said the governor who was represented by the Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Sam Egube.
