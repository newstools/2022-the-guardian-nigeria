Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency (DSVA) has taken its fight against sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) to riverine communities as a way of eradicating the menace in the state. Consequently, DSVA in collaboration with Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) has commenced an awareness campaign for those in the riverine areas, including residents of Lagos State that make use of jetties as a means of transportation.
 
The awareness campaign, which kicked off with a walk against domestic and sexual violence on Monday, saw officials of DSVA and LASWA walk from Military Hospital, Lagos to Falomo sensitising the public on the dangers of SGBV.
 
Speaking during the walk, Executive Secretary of DSVA, Mrs Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, restated the state government’s zero-tolerance of all forms of domestic and sexual violence.
