The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has doubled its dairy milk collection from 1,500 to 3000 litres per day. The effort is in line with the backward integration of the Federal Government that seeks to support the Nigerian Government National Livestock Transformation Plan (NLTP). The disclosure was made, yesterday, during the World Milk Day commemoration held at the Milk Collection Centre, Paikori-Kore community, in Gwagwalada Area Council. The Corporate Communications and Public Affairs Manager Nestle Nigeria Plc, Victoria Uwadoka, disclosed that the Nestle Livestock Development Programme, which was co-created by the Convention on Business Integrity and 2SCALE to support the NLTP, supported the project. The firm, Uwadoka said, has keyed into the NLTP objective of creating a viable ecosystem for dairy production to boost dairy milk production and improve community dynamics to achieve food security and economic development. She added that the collection centre has been refurbished with the capacity to produce 3000 litres of milk daily using solar power. Uwadoka said: “Under the programme, the health of the animals has improved as they make sure that cattle get a good feed, have enough water and ensure that they are vaccinated and receive the right vitamins. In line with this, over 6,000 herds of cattle have so far been vaccinated, dewormed and provided vitamins. We have also distributed multi-minerals to the community to make the cattle healthier and able to produce more milk.” She stated that Nestle Nigeria has also provided five industrial boreholes to the community saying three of the boreholes are dedicated to ensuring the cows have adequate water.
