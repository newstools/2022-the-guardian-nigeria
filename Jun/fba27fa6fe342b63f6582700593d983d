Endorses Ogah As Guber Candidate A faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State, yesterday, trooped to the party’s secretariat in Azikiwe Road, Umuahia, to protest against the alleged use of indirect primary to elect the Pro-Chancellor of University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), Chief Ikechi Emenike, as the governorship candidate for the 2023 election. The protesters, who claimed to have conducted its primaries by direct mode, as directed by the APC national leadership, said they elected the immediate past Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Uche Ogah, as the governorship flagbearer. Acting chairman of the Ogah faction, Chief Opusunji Wabara, told the protesters that the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, and the National Secretary, Iyiola Omisore, had already endorsed the candidates that emerged from their direct primaries, stressing that officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) monitored and certified the primaries as well as endorsed the results. His secretary, Perfect Okorie, said that no qualified aspirant was excluded from the primary and that the direct primary they applied enabled the aspirants to test their popularity. According to him, Ogah is the authentic and duly elected Abia APC governorship candidate for 2023 election.
