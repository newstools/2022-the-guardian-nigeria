The last may not have been heard of the suit between the oil and gas associations as a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos adjourned ruling in a preliminary objection to an N100 million suit by Nigerian Liquefied Petroleum Gas Association (NLPGA) against two other groups over the imposition of levies.  When the case was called on Thursday, Torhukerhuo appeared as an applicant, while Mrs Lolade Animashaun and Femi Aborishade appeared as first and second respondents respectively.
