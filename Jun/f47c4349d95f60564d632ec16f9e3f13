Nigerian singer, Bankole Wellington, known as Banky W, has won the ticket to contest a seat in the House of Representatives during the 2023 general elections. Bank W will be contesting the legislative seat for the Eti-Osa constituency on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The singer won the election with 24 votes against his challenger Sam Aiboni, who scored only five votes in the rerun election. “While we are grateful for our success at the primaries, we are completely heartbroken at the state of our nation,” Banky W said in an Instagram post to dedicate the victory to worshippers that were killed in a church attack in Owo, Ondo State on Sunday. “We must play our part in fixing the nation and we must get into the system to help fix it. Our work begins now. Please join us. “Grateful for the win, ready for the work. Thank you Lord, thank you PDP, thank you Eti-Osa & Lagos. Thank you everyone. God bless us all. Banky W’s victory comes two weeks after he was earlier declared the winner in the election but the result slip showed his challenger, Aiboni, as the winner. The PDP thereafter conducted another election due to Banky W’s sudden ouster from an election he was declared as winner initially.
