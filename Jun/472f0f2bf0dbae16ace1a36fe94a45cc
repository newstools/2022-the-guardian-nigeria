Governorship candidate of the Accord Party in Rivers State, Chief Dumo Lulu-Briggs, has said the state deserves a governor that will prioritise the people in every of his policies and programmes, adding that the next governor to rule the state must concentrate on getting things right. Lulu-Briggs, who spoke in Port Harcourt, yesterday, during an interactive session with representatives of the business community and professional bodies in Rivers State, said for the next governor of the state to drive positive development, the person must consistently relate the programmes of government to the people. He said: “The governor must be an engaging governor. He will engage with Rivers indigenes for them to know where they are and their feelings. Programmes of government will be communicated to the people. Transparency shall be the watchword. “If the people understand that truly you are working for them, then they will understand that there is a time that you must use to grow certain things that you need to see happen. “All of their desires will not be met overnight, but they need to know that you are truly   working to ensure their lives are better. It is important that there is no misunderstanding between the public and the public servant.”
