Members of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) and National Assembly Service Commission (NASC), yesterday, shut down activities at the National Assembly in Abuja. This followed the commencement of a strike action by both bodies. Executive committee members of PASAN blocked entrances of both the Red and Green chambers amid solidarity songs. The workers were demanding full payment of the outstanding 24 months national minimum wage and other conditions of service. They want the National Assembly management to implement the subsisting memorandum of understanding (MoU), jointly signed by NASC, NASS managements and PASAN on April 13, 2021, for payment of arrears. A statement from Clerk of the House, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria, regretted the inconveniences the shift in date may have caused.
