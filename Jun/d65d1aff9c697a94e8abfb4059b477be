Following a tip off from electorate, operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Saturday arrested one Mr Damola Ojo for inducing voters at Ola Oluwa Muslim Secondary School, Ado Ekiti. He was arrested with a large sum of money.
The party agent at the polling unit Babajide Adebayo, popularly known as Bishop in the vicinity, confirmed that Ojo is a PDP members but denied that he was inducing voters. Adebayo said, “When EFCC people came, somebody pointed at Ojo, who was standing alone. There was nobody with him; he was not talking to anybody or giving money to anybody. He was arrested and whisked away. Ojo is an engineer; he came to work in Ekiti but I have made calls to tell our leaders about the arrest.” EFCC operatives were seen in large number in some polling units where some major parties were alleged to have engaged in what is known in local parlance as “see and buy”. It was alleged that a particular party offered, as much as ₦10,000 to each electorate that voted for its candidate while other parties offered between ₦2,000 and ₦5,000. Efforts to speak to the EFCC personnel were not successful as they declined to answer if arrests have been made. But a source said their presence was to prevent vote buying, which many have feared may mar the credibility of the election.
