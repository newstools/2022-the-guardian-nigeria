Reacting to the clapback he received from members of Wizkid FC, Magixx returned to Twitter to explain the reason behind his tweet. For clarity pic.twitter.com/nBagkA1IEU — Magixx (@Iam_Magixx) June 20, 2022 Clearing the air, he noted that he had used “stupid” as slang for “dope”. Addressing his decision to delete the tweet, the “Love Don’t Cost A Dime” singer explained that he deleted the tweet because it was misunderstood. He wrote, “I think my only mistake yesterday was deleting that tweet. Why? I felt it was being misunderstood.” “Then this morning woke up to so many hate comments on my IG post, which goes to show how desperate these blogs are for comments and likes.” “I’m a music lover and if you check my history of tweets, I only tweet about music that I love. STUPID is a slang for Dope.” “I didn’t know I was going to get people hating for hyping a song, the irony. We really need to be better people. I’m so sick from all of these. I’ll be attaching the dictionary meaning to this tweet once again for clarity.” Magixx also shared a screenshot from an online dictionary that described stupid as a slang for “amazing.” Chris Brown released “Call Me Everyday” featuring Wizkid on Friday. The new single is off his forthcoming album “Breezy.” Chris Brown had earlier teased the almost three-minute-long single with a video of him dancing to the laid-back Afrobeats sound. Fans couldn’t get enough of the 30-second preview, already proclaiming it 2022’s summer song. Listen to “Call Me Everyday”
