It’s one that younger men dreaming of marriage express dissatisfaction over, as the victims of this belief system are ladies longing for a comfortable life after the knot is tied. We could be safer, at least, to reduce our statistics on men, because their rates of being gold-diggers might  purport to be minimal. As defined by Wikipedia, a “gold digger” is a term for a person, typically, a woman, who engages in a type of transactional relationship for money rather than for love. And if it turns to marriage, it’s a marriage of convenience. For a woman who is classified as having a signature gold-digging, she pants after men with greener pastures, having the ulterior motive of staying in a marriage on the pretext of love, beclouding the clear motive of going after her affluent lover’s wealth in the first place. While this long-held ideology on gold-digging might be true, it’s also noteworthy not to be bandied around its myths alone. Generally believed and accepted to be true, all humans desire comfort. Besides, no one wants to live a miserably curated life as a result of a decision made to be walked down an aisle. Whether it’s a man or a woman, both regret living an uncomfortable life based on their affirmative to an ‘I do’ proposal.

We may term it “gold-digging” (a popular opinion), but that’s the gospel truth. Much of what statistics show, it’s no less for ladies to settle for men with better means, who will provide them with a comfortable life. If it’s then a natural inclination for ladies to dream of living a comfortable life, not an average or a mediocre one, the parochial points of view held in high esteem on gold-digging should be swept away in the way dirt is parked neatly in the dunghill. To raise the specter of a new proposition, gold-digging (as an unpopular opinion) has two sides attached to its meaning. In this sense, the bad one wraps around the selfish intent of a money-thirsty, wealth-sucking lady whose quest for love is corrupted. And the good side reflects rigorous goodwill to be loved and cared for. The ladies that fall into this category don’t buy into the crass opportunity to be predators of rich men’s affluence. Instead, these whimsical sex only desire to be on a pedestal planning the future to be a better and more sustainable one for themselves and their families. Needless to say, about-to-marry youths need to understand the tactics and logistics that formulate how comfort is built into the family. Like a delectable dish with curried ingredients, comfort is cooked with love, care, and money. And with a sustainable means to make ends meet, marriage is built stronger, undaunted by the whirlwind of any financial crisis.
