During a Question and Answer session with fans, the businesswoman revealed that her marriage to the actor crashed due to lies. A fan had asked, “What really made you and your ex-husband separated?” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1785322 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2234" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5.jpg 357w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5-343x598.jpg 343w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5-138x240.jpg 138w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5-275x480.jpg 275w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-c74d76b0a5-344x600.jpg 344w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> To which Esisi replied, “Deceit.” The actress had earlier revealed that she and the actor were not divorced. Another fan asked, “When did you do your divorce? Because the last time we asked, you said not yet done.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1785319 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="2288" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4.jpg 344w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4-334x598.jpg 334w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4-134x240.jpg 134w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4-268x480.jpg 268w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-4-9e1c53bab4-336x600.jpg 336w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> “Last I checked, I signed no divorce papers,” she replied. Maureen Esisi and Blossom Chukwujekwu tied the knot in 2015 and separated in 2019. At the time, there were speculations that the marriage crashed because Blossom was still romantically linked to his actress ex-girlfriend. While Chukwujekwu is yet to address their split, Esisi has been vocal about the reasons for the failure of their relationship. A few weeks ago, Blossom tied the knot with his new wife, Winifred Akhuemokhan. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1785324 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1277" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding.jpg 934w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-599x598.jpg 599w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-58x58.jpg 58w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-116x116.jpg 116w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-241x240.jpg 241w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-481x480.jpg 481w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/blossom-chukwujekwu-wedding-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The wedding ceremony, which was officiated by, pastor Chris Oyakhilome, was attended by friends, family members of the couple, and many entertainment favorites.
