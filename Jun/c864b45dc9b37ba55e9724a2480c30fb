Organizers of the Kwara Inter-Secondary Schools Volleyball Championship have revealed the list of participating schools for the maiden grassroots volleyball championship, which officially began yesterday.  “I want to appreciate all who made this programme possible because without this partnership, I do not think this competition would have taken off. “Organising any sporting event, especially one that is not football, can be tough, but we are happy that this is finally happening despite several obstacles we faced,” he said.
 
He commended stakeholders, including the Kwara Sports Commission, the Kwara Volleyball Association and the Kwara State Volleyball referees and the media for their contributions to the tournament. The competition, which started yesterday, will end tomorrow with the winners getting various prizes.
