 Falana Energy Re-Up Falana returns with the final focus track from her critically acclaimed Rising EP, ‘Energy” Re-Up, which boasted hits tracks “Joy” & “Sweet Adetola”. As one of the original Alte artistes, the Falana sound could never make it in description as simply R&B or Afrobeat. The Energy Re-Up, with additional production by BK2/The Fullest, adds a live funky bassline and layered keys to the original USA /Jamaican producer, Tyler Richards’ dancehall inspired production. Additional vocals to this engaging tune, added by co-writer, Sir Dauda, provides a melodic rap around Falana’s sweet vocal performance which centres on the pleasures of being young, carefree and in love with everything, and life! The audio and NFT’s release is supported with a “good vibes” music video conceptualised by Falana and directed by the Lagos based, 2 Brothers who have worked with groundbreaking artistes like Wizkid, Burna Boy, Asa, Ladipoe, Sauti Sol. The music video for ‘Energy Re-Up’ is a real “girl power” affair with bedrooms, road trips, party and performance elements, all providing a full visual palette which captures the sound and the performance of the track, perfectly timed for release as a summer anthem and on everyone’s playlists.
