Organisers of the Okpekpe International 10km Road Race, Pamodzi Sports Marketing, have acknowledged that the eight edition of the event held on Saturday would not have been successful without the unflinching support from Edo State government and partners. “Since the inception of the race in 2013, we have always enjoyed huge support from the Edo State government and this year’s event was not different,” Pamodzi boss, Mike Itemuagbor, said. Speaking on the race, Itemuagbor commended Governor Godwin Obaseki for ensuring “there was an enabling environment, which enabled the organisation of what people have said is the best Okpekpe Race since we got the historic label status in 2015.” He also heaped plaudits on Comrade Philips Shaibu, the ‘digital’ deputy governor of Edo State.
