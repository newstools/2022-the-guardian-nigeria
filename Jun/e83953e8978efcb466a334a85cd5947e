Rolling Stone shared the announcement that Trainor’s fourth studio album will be released on October 21st. The album will feature collaborations with Natti Natasha, Arturo Sandoval, and Teddy Swims. Trainor will reflect on her life as a wife and a new mom in “Takin’ It Back”, as well as her quest to regain confidence in her new body. When discussing the album with Rolling Stone, Trainor explained that Takin’ It Back refers to her regaining the power she felt she lost during the pandemic in addition to going back to the classic sounds of pop songs set to live instrumentation. “I just felt like anything I ever achieved is all gone,” Trainor said. “I haven’t been out in public and [for] so long trying to be safe, and it crippled me a little bit with my confidence. And so coming back with music, I was also so hard on myself. I thought all these songs were trash. Every idea I would come up with, I would say, ‘Is this trash or amazing?’ ‘Is this garbage or is this dope?’ And everyone was like, ‘This is your best work yet.’ I think when I started seeing [and] hearing people that don’t have to be nice to me tell me that this music is good, that’s when I was like, ‘Maybe I do have something special.’ A few days ago, Meghan announced that her lead single off the album “Bad For Me” featuring Teddy Swims would be released on Friday, June 24th. The singer shared the news on social media on Tuesday, alongside the song’s cover art which features the musical collaborators in enchanting green outfits, sitting among a floral landscape at sunset.
