About one and a half billion children lack access to any form of family support as well as any kind of cash benefits, a joint report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) has revealed.
     
While calling for an extension of social protection to alleviate the challenges confronting children worldwide, the report noted that social protection reduces family poverty and vulnerability, thereby, diminishing key drivers of child labour.
     
The report said too little progress has been made in ensuring that all children enjoy social protection.  To strengthen social protection systems for the prevention and elimination of child labour, the report called for the closing of the social protection coverage gap for children; build integrated social protection systems.
It submitted that reducing child labour will be easier if countries have a social protection system that provides adequate benefits throughout the life cycle, from child and family benefits, maternity and unemployment benefits to old-age pensions, as well as health protection.
      
It also called for the strengthening of the strong political commitment that already exists to end child labour and establish universal social protection to strengthen consensus for action.
