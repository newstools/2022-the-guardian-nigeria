Buoyed by the spectacular achievement of Major-General Muhammadu Buhari in his rabid drive of the undisguised Fulanization Agenda, 16 countries where the pastoral Fulani could be found were emboldened to gather in Abuja recently to perfect their grand design of taking over the Nigerian space by hook or crook. The theme of their meeting, hosted by the Unitary Government headquartered in Abuja, was the Future of the Fulani Pastoralists in Nigeria.
 
Nobody has been left in doubt that President Buhari who is the Grand Patron of the ubiquitous and muscle-flexing Miyetti Allah (which has unabashedly owned up to serial bloodletting in Plateau, Benue and Taraba states) and also the preferred Chief Negotiator for the one of the world’s leading Terrorist Groups, Boko Haram (‘Attack on Boko Haram is attack on the North’—Buhari 2014) is bent on completing the ferocious Jihad of 1848 on behalf of the Caliphate.
