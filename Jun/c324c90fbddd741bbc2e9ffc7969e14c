The Nigerian government on Thursday said the Islamic State, West African Province (ISWAP) was responsible for the attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, that led to the death of about 40 persons last Sunday. Briefing newsmen at the end of the National Security Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, joined by the Inspector General of Police
Alkali Baba Usman, who made the disclosure, said security agencies are now zeroing in the culprits. While noting that their imprints have been ascertained in the attack, the Police boss, however, said no arrests have been made by the authorities. Aregbesola dispelled insinuations of ethnic-religious connection in the attack and affirmed that the group activity has nothing to do with the Islamic religion. The minister stated that the council is also concerned about killings in the name of blasphemy and has directed the security agencies to go after perpetrators of the separate incidents in Sokoto State and Abuja recently. He added that enough security arrangement has been made for the Ekiti State gubernatorial election taking place on June 18, 2022.
