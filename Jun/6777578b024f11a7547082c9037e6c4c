A Georgia probe into whether Trump pressured state officials to sway the state’s 2020 election has ordered Holder to provide testimony. This came after Holder released a video clip, revealing comments of the former president Donald Trump. In an interview with BBC Holder said, the district Attorney in Georgia has reached out to him concerning the video clip.
When asked by the BBC correspondent if he felt his life was threatened, Holder said, “Well my life changed about a week ago, an now I literally have two armed guards outside the studio that follow me around everywhere, of course I mean apparently according to some I’m an undercover FBI agent.” He continued, “There’s all sorts of conspiracies and threats that are coming through so absolutely but I think at the end of the day, I’m going to comply and do whatever I need to do to work with any supine anything that comes in a lawful manner of course I’ll do it and tell the truth. I have nothing to hide and that’s it. I record history and I’ll provide any committee or or investigation with what they need for them to do their investigation.” The documentary series titled “Unprecedented” will be broadcast on Discovery.
