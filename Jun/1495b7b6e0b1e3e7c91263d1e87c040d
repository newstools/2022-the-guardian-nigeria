Kaduna State Cricket team touched down in Abuja last weekend after a weeklong cricket tour of Uganda in their bid to raise the state team’s game ahead of schedules later in the year. Head Coach of the team, Oche Onoja, said the government’s sport policy has been very encouraging, adding it includes an international exposure for the team as reward for their impressive results on national level so far. “Kaduna State has been a cricket development power-house and the state’s plan is to help some of the outstanding talents that the state has produced gain experience and exposure for better performance,” Oche said. He said this year’s series in Uganda exposed the team to better facilities and made them test against some of the strongest they have ever played. He said, “it was not a jamboree, but an opportunity to tighten loose ends ahead of some other tough games ahead. “The National Sports Festival is nearby and we have a couple of players we are introducing to the first team, coupled with the need to see better playing experience. In all, our team proved themselves and learnt valuable lessons that we would take into future games,” he said. According to Onoja, “Kaduna State boasts top members of the national team, including the national captain, and an all-rounder. “For now, Kaduna State is still a major team that determines the strength of the national team in a lot of ways. Whatever exposure we give the state team still benefits the nation. And we are glad that national body admits and support our quests for progress on all fronts.”
