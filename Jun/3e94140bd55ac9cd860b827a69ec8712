The initiator of Mark D Ball Basketball Championship, Igoche Mark, has said there is more to be done to raise the standard of elite and grassroots basketball in Nigeria. Mark, who commended players and coaches for their sportsmanship at the ongoing men’s Mark D Ball Basketball Championship final Eight taking place at the MKO Abiola stadium, Abuja, called on more basketball-loving Nigerians to organise the game in their various regions. He said inactivity that enveloped the fortunes of basketball since 2017 at the grassroots level, has affected the dunking game. Speaking at the Elite 8  yesterday, at the Indoor Sports Hall, Package B of the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, Mark reaffirmed his commitment to invest more time and resources in developing all aspect of the dunking game. “I am quite happy with all I have seen, but I’m not satisfied with the level of our basketball at this time, and this is a reminder to me and all genuine stakeholders of the game that we have more to do in order to bring all aspects of the game, to an appreciable standard,” he said. Mark also praised coach Ime Udoka for leading Boston Celtics to NBA Finals despite losing to Golden State Warriors 103-90. “I won’t need rocket science to know that Udoka’s handwork, dedication, tenacity and zeal brought him this far. I Recall in January the Celtics were 18-21, in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, but he led them to the NBA Finals. Udoka is my MVP,” Mark stated.
