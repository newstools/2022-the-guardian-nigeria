Ibadan Golf Club (IGC) executive committee has appointed Oyinlola Omajuwa and three others as members of an interim caretaker committee for the Ladies Section.
 
According to a letter signed by the club’s secretary, Seyi Alaba, the action is in line with article 13:3:1-5 of the club’s constitution, saying it unanimously nominated Ms. Omolaraeni Olaosebikan, Mrs. Dorcas Oluwatunmise, Mrs. Lizzy Afonja, a former Lady Captain and Mrs. Oyinlola Omajuwa, as head of the committee.
  
Omajuwa, in her acceptance speech, pledged to restore the glory of the section by operating an open door policy and carrying along the ladies in the section’s deliberations and discussions.
 
“I’m overwhelmed with your support and confidence in me, and while thanking you for your support, I want to assure you that my team will ensure that all ladies will be carried along in all the section’s deliberations and discussions. I also assure you that all efforts shall be made to restore the past glory of this section, but please note that we cannot succeed without your full support,” Omajuwa noted.
 
Meanwhile, the club will this weekend host about 180 golfers in the Captain’s Inaugural Golf Tournament, which will be used to usher in the club’s new captain, Tunji Oladosu. The tournament will start today and end tomorrow.
