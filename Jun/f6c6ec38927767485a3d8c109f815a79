It’s an honour… I mean, this is my first award show that I’m winning something, and I just want to use this as an opportunity to speak to every single young, old, whatever, every single woman watching this, every single girl watching this at home. Where I’m from, things like this don’t happen.” Tems also bagged the award for the Best Collaboration with Wizkid’s “Essence” featuring Justin Bieber at the 2022 BETs.
