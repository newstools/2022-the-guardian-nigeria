And while you’ll definitely be able to see your skin’s texture wearing makeup, there’s a huge difference between this and looking like you plastered your foundation on your face. Cakey foundation is a big no-no, and the first step to fixing it is identifying why your foundation looks like it wasn’t blended at all. One reason this might be is the foundation itself, and the second is your skin. Need to know more about cakey foundation and how to fix it? Here’s the article for you. Skin prep is all of the work when it comes to applying makeup. In fact even the best makeup artists suggest a proper skincare routine before applying makeup to your face. The readiness of your skin to receive makeup also accounts for how foundation looks on your skin. For a proper skin-like finish, you’ll need the right skin prep, one that includes a moisturizer and primer to create the proper base for your foundation. Applying foundation just after your primer would definitely have it looking like it was thrown right on your face. The trick is to allow your skincare products and primers dry before applying foundation to prevent caking. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1778467 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1919" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-scaled.jpeg 1708w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-399x598.jpeg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-769x1152.jpeg 769w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-1025x1536.jpeg 1025w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-1366x2048.jpeg 1366w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-160x240.jpeg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-320x480.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-de839a05c6-400x600.jpeg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Using a different shade of foundation could cause your makeup to look unnatural. To fix this, it’s important to identify your skin’s undertones. Knowing if your skin has a cool, warm or neutral undertone would help you choose the right foundation shade. Like we mentioned earlier, sometimes it’s not your skin that’s the problem, it’s the foundation itself. Your skin type plays a huge role in how your foundation looks on your skin. So for dry skin type choose foundations with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or liquid formulations, Sensitive skin types would benefit from colour-correcting foundations, especially the matte kinds. While matte foundations are best suited for oily skin. When choosing a foundation, make sure to find one that mimics your skin with a light formula for a hydrated, glowy finish. Using too much product can also contribute to cakiness. There’s only so much you can blend when you apply a lot of product. Too much foundation equals uneven application and too many layers create blotches and camera flashbacks. You can find the right foundation, blend properly and still end up with Cakey foundation if you forget the final, most important step, and that is setting. Using a setting product (spray or powder) ensures your foundation stays in place with an even finish. Spray some setting spray a few inches from your face for a whole lot of difference.
