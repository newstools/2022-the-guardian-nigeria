Lady Captain of Dolphin Golf Club, Navy Town Ojoo, Lagos, Mrs. Onwuegbu Bose Ngozi, is still relishing her tour to Turkey, which is reputed as a quality golfing destination with outstanding golf courses, hotels and facilities, where she had regular rounds of 18 holes play during her birthday. Onwuegbu said the expedition to some top golf courses in Nairobi, Mauritius and Europe, especially Antalya, Turkey, was part of her move to promote the game during her 2022 birthday. She said she had opportunity to share the golf course of Titanic Golf Club with top professionals such as Tiger Woods and some international pros. “Where I visited were key destinations for golf tourism, from teeing off on the Mediterranean coast to an inner-city swing of the short iron and mingling with professional golfers that share new skills with you during golfing break. “Part of my intention is to gather and compile my experience from such exposure and replicating such here by creating good golf tourism destinations that other golfers from outside the country will be eager to visit for adventurous golfing excursions,” she noted. The zonal representative, South/West of the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF), also revealed that: “Like faith, golf requires us to lose our old nature. We first must learn the proper grip. Our old nature tells us to grip the club tightly, so we have total control. But in golf, though, a tight grip keeps us from meeting the ball squarely and it sails off in a wayward direction. “Human nature tells us the harder we swing, the farther the ball will fly. But this doesn’t work in golf. Using our strength to muscle the ball will only advance it a short distance. Golf requires a light touch and an easy swing.”
