Three words that should come to mind when we hear K-fashion are elegant, graceful, and classy. It basically embodies the fusion of traditional style and modern fashion to create ingenious apparel. The sense of style is rather conservative, what I call a “delicate aesthetic,” the direct opposite of grunge aesthetics. In K-fashion, the combination of prints is quite distinctive compared to other cultures. Rather than exploring, they stick to one or two prints, keeping it simple and minimal yet classy. When it comes to colours, in other cultures, vibrant, energetic colours like neon and bubbly colours are the trend, while it is the opposite in K-fashion. People who dress in vibrant colours in Korea are easily portrayed as less fashionable. They wear solid neutral shades and basic colour palettes, keeping fashion simple but in a bold style. If you search for Korean fashion aesthetics, you will most likely be met with muted colours and pastel colours. In terms of revealing skin, Koreans will choose a part to flaunt while they cover up the rest. For instance, if they wear a pair of shorts, they complement them with an elegant blouse for a formal look or a sweatshirt for a casual look. This culture expresses how distinct Korean fashion is compared to western fashion, where showing off skin is very common. One fraction of K-fashion that should not be omitted is the use of accessories. You might not be a fan of tote bags, but have you seen a Korean man carry a tote bag? Don’t even get me started with the use of jewellery. A prominent and classy look for Korean women is the mix of high-waisted pants with a luxurious blouse complemented with high heels. Eleganto! <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1791935 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion.jpeg 1600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion-898x598.jpeg 898w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion-320x213.jpeg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion-640x426.jpeg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/K-fashion-600x400.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Some of the trends in Korea are cool blazers, slacks, high waist palazzo pants, denim, miniskirts, jumpsuits, polo shirts, straight-cut jeans, trench coats, padded jackets, and playsuits. My all-time favourite look for Korean men is when they combine formal clothing with casual clothing to dress down and still end up appearing sophisticated. An example is wearing a thesaurus shirt and slacks complemented with cool blazers, and a face cap and low-top sneakers. A particularly Uber-stylish look is tucked-in polo shirts or collared shirts with slacks, complemented with a trench coat to add an element of intricacy. Koreans seem to love wearing clothes that stimulate graceful auras, often oversized but sophisticated, which gives rise to the conclusion that K-fashion is discreet and focused on utmost comfort. When you finally see the light and decide to dress in K-fashion style, always remember to make it “elegant but simple”. K-fashion is a major source of inspiration to the fashion world, and I am a victim of its supremacy.
