Detectives of the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) Lagos, have arrested a 29-year-old Rafiu Rahaman, a staff of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) for faking his own kidnap. Rahaman, after faking his own kidnap travelled to Lugbe in Abuja, where he made a video of himself in captivity, which was sent to his co-worker. His accomplice, Usman Sheidu, 32, who demanded N5 million ransom but got N150, 000 after extensive negotiation has equally been arrested. According to the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Benjamin Hundeyin, Mr. Sheidu, who was arrested in Abuja conspired with Rahaman to self-stage the kidnap and make the video that was sent to the co-worker for ransom. Usman also confessed to have shared the ransom equally with Rahaman and used his share in acquiring a generator and other items for himself. The police spokesperson said the suspects would be arraigned in court at the conclusion of investigations. The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Alabi, while commending the detectives for a job well done, reassured Lagosians that perpetrators of crimes would not go undetected and unpunished.
