Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi has indefinitely suspended the state Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Mr Orlando Nweze over his alleged “inability to discharge his duties effectively”. The suspension notice was signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Dr Kenneth Ugbala, and made available to newsmen on Wednesday in Abakaliki. The governor directed Nweze to hand over all government property in his possession to the permanent secretary of the ministry before the close of work on Wednesday, June 15. “Please, ensure strict compliance to this directive,” the statement read.
