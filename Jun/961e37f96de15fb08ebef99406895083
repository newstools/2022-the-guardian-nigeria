Lydia Ko’s hopes of winning a third major title at the US Women’s Open hang in the balance after a disappointing opening round in North Carolina, reports www.stuff.co.nz. The Kiwi golfer shot a one-over round of 72 for a share of 64th place on a difficult day at the US$10 million (NZ$15.3m) LPGA tournament at Pine Needles Golf Club. Swedish amateur Ingrid Lindblad holds the early clubhouse lead, two strokes clear of Australian world No 4 Minjee Lee and compatriot Anna Nordqvist, after carding a sizzling six-under-par 65. Ko’s major bid got off to a poor start with a bogey on the par-5 opening hole. She then made par on the next five, before a second bogey on the seventh left her well off the pace. However, the 25-year-old bounced back on the very next hole with a birdie and then drew level par with another on the 517-yard 10th. But a third bogey of the day on the par-five 15th put Ko back on one-over and she was unable to make up any ground on the leaders in the remaining three holes. Ko will need to go low in her second round today (Saturday NZT) if she is to get herself into contention for the US$1.8 million (NZ$2.75 million) prize. New Zealand golfers are flying on the world stage and Ko says it’s inspiring. She spoke recently of how she feels she is at the “happiest point” of her life having rediscovered her form following a notable slump. The world No 3 has also been inspired by the recent success of her fellow Kiwis Steven Alker and Ryan Fox on the PGA Tour Champions and DP World Tour respectively. “I saw that Steve won last week, and I was watching Foxy’s playoff in the dining hall, moving my chair to get a better view, and he played amazing,” she said. “He came second I think a few weeks ago, so it’s really cool to see the New Zealand flag being shown out there.” Ko has not finished outside of the top 25 in any tournament this season but has work to do at Pine Needles if she wants to maintain that record.
