This year’s first release is a new Afro track, Jolie, which kicks out the year on a high note. Jaysynthsbeatz was in charge of the production, as he features Tanzanian artists G Nako and Franklin Maston to deliver the smooth love and African anthem. After each play, you can offer your spouse additional assurance by singing Jolie, which means pretty in French. Jolie is a love song that lets you give your partner more assurance and builds the love life bond not leaving out the importance of dance and that party vibe
