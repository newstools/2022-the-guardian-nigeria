Enoch Nwali has won the second Emmanuel Egbele yearly scrabble championship, which ended at Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos, at the weekend. Umujose Emmanuel took the second position, while former World Scrabble champion, Wellington Jighere, finished third in the Masters category of the championship.  Nwali, who is an undergraduate at the University of Lagos and also second best player at the just concluded West African Scrabble Championship held in Accra, Ghana, attributed his victory to hard work and determination to succeed at all times. “I am delighted winning the EEAST Scrabble Championship. As a young player and student, coming tops among great players pushes me to always fight to be the best. “It is a victorious moment for me after just coming second in the West African championship in Ghana. I urge youths to put their interest in scrabble, as it would give them the platform to sharpen their intellectual horizon and grow more in the sport,” he said. The organiser of the event, Emmanuel Egbele, said the championship opened more opportunities for the country’s players to excel in the game. He pleaded for more sponsors to key into the yearly event to give the tourney more international flavour in subsequent editions. “My objective as the South West zonal representative in the Nigeria Scrabble Federation board is to promote the sport at all levels. I am delighted that more scrabble players registered for this year’s championship.” “In subsequent editions, scrabble players from other countries will get opportunity to participate in the tourney to add more glamour to the event,” he said. Nwali got N250, 000 as top prize money for winning the masters category, Emmanuel Enyi earned N100, 000 for winning the Opens event, while Taiwo Adeniran got N150, 000 for winning the intermediate category.
