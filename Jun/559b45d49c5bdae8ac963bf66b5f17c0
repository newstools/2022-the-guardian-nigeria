The European Union (EU) has partnered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to organise the second edition of ‘Youth Votes Count’, a free music concert to encourage more youths to register and vote in the 2023 general elections.
  
The organisers emphasised the need for younger people to be actively involved in the political processes, saying this would bridge the gap of voter apathy in the country.    
 
Speaking about the project, Project Manager at EU, Mrs. Olaolu Olawunmi, said the concert would take place at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos on Saturday, June 11, by 10 a.m. and the only gate pass needed is the Personal Voter Card (PVC) or Temporary Voter Card (TVC).
  
‘Youth Vote Count’ initiative is a non-partisan campaign, funded by the EU and was launched in 2018 with the sole objective of getting young people to participate more in the electoral process.
