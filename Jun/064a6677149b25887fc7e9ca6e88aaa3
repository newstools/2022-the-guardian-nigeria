Amusan Sets New 100m Hurdles Record Of 12.54secs The national trials in Benin City, Edo State to pick athletes for this year’s World Athletics Championship in Oregon, United States and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom, yesterday produced new 100m champions in the men and women’s events respectively. United States-based sprinter, Ashe Favour, emerged the fastest Nigerian in the 100m km, beating a field of star athletes to win in 9.99seconds. The defending champion, Enoch Adegoke, who equally ran 9.99 seconds to win in last year’s event at Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, could not make it to the final due to injury. At yesterday’s final, Ashe proved his worth as one of Nigeria’s athletes to look out for in Oregon and Birmingham, as he powered to the finish line to become the 12th Nigerian to break the under 10.00 second. Alaba Akintola was second in 10.00 seconds, while Godson Brume finished third in 10.00 seconds. Old-timer and London-based Seyi Ogunlewe placed fourth in 10.22 seconds. In the women’s 100m race, Grace Nwokocha ran 11.06 seconds to win, while Rosemary Chukwuma was second in 11.07 seconds and Tima Godbless finished third in 11.38 seconds. Blessing Okagbare, who won the 100m title last year is currently serving a 10-year ban due to drugs-related issues. Perhaps, one major event that caught the attention of everyone at the stadium yesterday was the 100m hurdles final, where Tobi Amusan set a new championship record of 12.54seconds. Speaking on the records, and excited President of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria, Tonobok Okowa, said that the nation would give other countries a good challenge in the race for medals in Oregon in July and Birmingham in August.
