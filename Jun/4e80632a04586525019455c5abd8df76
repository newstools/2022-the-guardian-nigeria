Hutchings had posted a picture celebrating her 35th birthday on Sunday but soon came under fire from many critics who accused her of lying about her age.   A post shared by Caroline Danjuma (@carolynahutchings) Taking to Instagram days later, she shared a photo of herself, her mum and her daughter.   A post shared by Caroline Danjuma (@carolynahutchings) In the lengthy caption, she wrote, “Trilogy. This is my mum who is in her 50’s, so how in God’s name will I be 46 ? Am I reducing my age because I need a job in a company? I am the CEO of mine.” “Reducing my age for Nollywood? An actor can act in both young and old roles. Makeup can be applied. I am reducing my age because of school? I have enough certificates already.” “Reducing my age because of a relationship? A good man will love his woman regardless of her age. Reduce my age for your validation? I don’t give two F’s about you, sugar.” She continued, “Not everyone in a class is the same age. In secondary school, I had people 5 years older than me in my class. In university, my assistant class rep was 45 years old. In my master’s, my class rep was 23 and I 34. In my MBA, I had both young and old.” “Just because you acted a movie with me does NOT mean we are the same age. You are asking for my birth certificate, Have you seen your own mother and father’s birth certificate before?” “That it took you time to achieve something in your life does not mean I have to run your race. We have different glory and destiny. That you started school late and failed the entrance exam a couple of times is none of my business. We don’t have the same IQ.”
She went on to address people who used her Nollywood career as basis for their argument. “Stupid people saying they watched me as a kid. I was in the industry for only two years before my marriage. Bomboclat can’t stand my glory.” “Are you aware Wikipedia can be created and edited by ANYONE? And not everything on Google is a FACT? Even Christ was married on Google. To the clowns talking unintelligently about my age, mind the business that pays you.” “Any age, race, or class can act a movie. Any one can be a star at any age; no rules to follow. Yes, I am 35 years old and this will be the last time I will address this.” “I don’t need to be an old woman to achieve anything or be an actress. Success and luck come to anyone when it is their time. Focus on making money.”
