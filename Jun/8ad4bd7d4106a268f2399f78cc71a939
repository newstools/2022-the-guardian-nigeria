Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), in Saturday’s governorship election in Ekiti State, Mr Segun Oni came a distant second to the winner and governor-elect, Mr Abiodun Oyebamiji of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).  He joined Fayemi in APC, where he rose to the position of Deputy National Chairman (South) of APC. He resigned the position to participate in the 2018 APC primary, where he came second behind Fayemi. Dissatisfied with the conduct of the primary, Oni headed to court to challenge the candidacy of Fayemi, whom he alleged refused to resign from the Federal cabinet appointment within the stipulated time and also over allegation that he was indicted by the Judicial Panel of inquiry set up by Fayose’s government. He eventually lost the legal battle at the apex court. For taking the party to court, his supporters were schemed out of both appointive and elected positions by Fayemi’s government. He was later suspended indefinitely for anti party activities in APC, which forced him to return to PDP in 2019 to activate his governorship project.
 
In the PDP primary election held on January 27, 2022, he came second behind Mr. Bisi Kolawole, who was elected candidate, but Oni and others faulted the conduct of the shadow election, which they alleged was manipulated in favour of Kolawole. He again dumped the PDP and joined SDP.  According to him: “We really don’t see someone who has never won an election in his life as a threat. I challenge anybody to dispute this, Oni has never won an election in his life; be it party election or general election. Even when he became governor, the court ruled that he was never a governor, that Fayemi won the election. He was never a governor in the face of the law. The primary election that brought him to that office, he came third.”
