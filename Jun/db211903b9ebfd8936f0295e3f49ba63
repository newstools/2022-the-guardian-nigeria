The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), yesterday, reiterated that tomorrow’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying encounter between the Super Eagles and the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, will be played without fans in the stands.
 
NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, said the situation is a consequence of the one-match ban placed on the country by world football–governing body, FIFA, over the fracas that followed the end of 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff round against the Black Stars of Ghana in March.  
 
“We want to appeal to our very passionate football fans to take heart for this one game. It is only a one-match ban, after which they can again start trooping out to support the Super Eagles. The match against Sierra Leone will be without fans as a consequence of what happened after the match against the Ghanaians.
