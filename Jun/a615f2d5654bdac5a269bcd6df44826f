The Federal Government and other stakeholders have been urged to prioritise the protection of children against all forms of abuses.
 
The Founder of Live Abundantly, Dr. Onyerinma Ama, who gave the advice, during the organisation’s Children Awareness Initiative Programme,  with the theme: “Building A Better Future For Our Children,”  identified child abuse, poverty, bullying, and insecurity as part of challenges facing children.
 
The event had in attendance pupils across primary and secondary schools in Lagos State, their teachers, artistes, government agencies and other stakeholders, who taught the pupils their right to various abuses.
 
While noting that it is the responsibility of the parents, teachers and caregivers to ensure that children’s mental wellbeing are secured, Ama emphasised the need to ensure that they are also protected from all forms of abuse.
 
She appealed to all children, especially girls, to report cases of abuse to the necessary quarters immediately, to nip the act in the bud and for the perpetrators to be apprehended. Ama said: “A girl is not a sexual object, a girl must not be violated and if she’s is violated, it must be reported, it must be dealt with. And if you get married, you are not there to satisfy the sexual desires of your husband; you are there for other things.  He enjoined parents to give their time, affection, praise, and unconditional love and guide them jealously.
