Chairman/Chief EXECUTIVE of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Retd), yesterday, called for a mandatory drug test for youth corps members as they report for their one-year national service at the various orientation camps across the country.  “We need counselling centres in the primary health care centres at the grassroots, where we don’t have enough manpower to cover and this is where the young men and women of NYSC come in. 
 
“We can train them in their numbers to serve as counsellors at the grassroots level because a majority of drug users only need counselling.”
   
Earlier, Brig. Gen. Fadah said the visit was to appreciate NDLEA for past support of the scheme and to ask for further collaboration as NYSC prepares to open the gates of orientation camps across the country.
