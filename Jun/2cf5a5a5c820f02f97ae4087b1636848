According to Variety, Garner, who recently received accolades for her role as Anna Netflix documentary “Inventing Anna,” was in stiff competition for the role against “Black Widow” star Florence Pugh, “Euphoria” star Alexa Demie, and Odessa Young. Madonna’s biopic will follow the early days of the oft-controversial artist and queen of perpetual reinvention. While Garner is yet to accept the offer, Variety reports that the actress’ team is considering accepting the offer. The biopic fronted by Universal Days will feature Madonna herself as its writer/director, and “Little Women” producer Amy Pascal will also join the project as a producer. If Garner accepts the role, it will mark a significant milestone in her budding career. Earlier this year, she enjoyed renowned recognition for her role as Anna Sorokin in Shondaland’s ‘Inventing Anna,’ a limited series based on convicted fraudster Anna Delvey. Her role as Ruth Langmore in the Netflix crime drama series “Ozark” earned her a nomination in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category at the 2021 Primetime Emmy Awards and a nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Television at the 2021 Golden Globes.
