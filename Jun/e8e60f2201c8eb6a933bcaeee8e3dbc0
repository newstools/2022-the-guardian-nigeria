It was not the best time for many residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), yesterday, as long queues of motorists jostling for Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) compounded with the presidential primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to foist hardship on citizens. Although long queues have persisted due to scarcity of petrol, security operatives and traffic agencies were overwhelmed in the early hours of the day as most roads were blocked due to traffic diversion. The development, which started on Monday evening, saw residents trekking long distances while returning from work as transport fare for most e-hailing vehicles and other commercial vehicles surged. Some offices shut down their operations way above their regular closing hours yesterday as motorists seek alternative routes to avoid the logjam. Most of the roads leading directly to the Eagle Square, venue of the APC convention, were shut. A lawyer, Ojoma Akoji, said she had to cope with over five times surge on her e-hailing application. She noted that although she left her Lugbe residence earlier than usual, she got to destination way behind schedule. It was similar experience for a banker, Ejura Odufu, who told The Guardian that she had to trek after close of work because she couldn’t find a vehicle due to the traffic. A motorist, Yusuf Sani, who was caught in traffic in the Wuse area, decried the development, adding that FCT administration should have a better way to manage traffic at a time like this. Most fuel stations across the FCT were equally dispensing petrol under heavy queues as scarcity, which started earlier in the year, resurfaced. In some cases, motorists remained on queue even when the stations had no fuel as black marketers sell a litre for N400.
