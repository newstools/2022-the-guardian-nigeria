National Chairman of Ogwashi Uku Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Leaders and Elders Forum (OPDPLEF), Chief A.C. Okocha, has congratulated Sheriff Oborevwori on his emergence as the PDP governorship candidate in last week’s Delta State governorship primaries. Oborevwori, who is the Delta State House of Assembly Speaker, recorded a landslide victory. Okocha, in a statement, disclosed that Oborevwori’s victory signified an overwhelming acceptance of his candidature by the people of Delta State. He added that this fact was amply demonstrated by the wide margin of votes the incumbent Speaker garnered in the primaries.
 
“Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that you have clearly and incontrovertibly demonstrated your acceptance by the generality of our party delegates to fly the party’s flag,” Okocha stated, adding: “This feat, without any doubt, is a pointer to great things to come. He also congratulated Prince Ned Nwoko, Godwin Ndudi Elumelu and Chief lsaac Anwuzia on their emergence as the party’s candidates in Delta North Senatorial District, Aniocha/Oshimili Federal Constituency and Aniocha South Constituency respectively. Okocha further noted that there was no doubt that the candidates’ track records of service to Delta people over the years had reflected in their widespread acceptance to fly the party’s flag. “I also wish to thank our party leader in the state, Senator lfeanyi Okowa, for ensuring level-playing field, which gave rise to free, fair, and transparent primaries, such that those who didn’t get the tickets were congratulating the winners. It’s indeed a family affair,” Okocha added.
