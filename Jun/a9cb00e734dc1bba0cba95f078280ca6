Only Enugu State might escape the rampage With their two states apiece in the Southeast, emerging indicators show that governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would be lucky to sustain their presence after the forthcoming general elections.  Abia
TWO developments are working against the governing PDP and opposition APC in Abia State: Both parties are factionalised and troubled by contentious primaries that threw up different candidates.
  
Former governorship candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the state, Dr. Alex Otti, who moved over to APC to contest the 2023 governorship, expressed concern over plots by former Minister of State for Solid Mineral and Steel Development, Dr. Uche Ogah and Chief Ikechi Emenike to appropriate the governorship ticket through underhand methods.
   
Instead of staying back to waste energy and resources in search of a troubled ticket, the former Managing Director of Diamond Bank rushed his structures and supporters into LP, where he emerged as the party’s gubernatorial standard-bearer. 
  
No sooner had the two APC factions in the state held parallel primaries than some of the members started joining Otti on the LP platform, even as a leader of one of the factions, Emenike, was accused of holding indirect primary against the party’s directives.  Enugu
BUT for the political engineering of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, which saw to the amicable observation of the power rotation arrangement in the emergence of Dr. Peter Mbah and Barrister Ifeanyi Ossai as PDP standard-bearers, Enugu would have been at the mercy of the political recalibration going on in Southeast.
