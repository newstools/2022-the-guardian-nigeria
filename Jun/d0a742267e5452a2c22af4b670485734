Gunmen suspected to be bandits on Thursday went on rampage in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), setting ablaze two tractors and abducting no fewer than 22 farmers. The incident occurred at Rafin-Daji community in Gurdi Ward of Abaji Area Council of Abuja. A farmer who escaped abduction told newsmen that the incident happened around 2.p.m on Thursday when the bandits wielding AK-47 rifles attacked the farmers that were tilling their land in the Rafin-Daji community, which shares a boundary with a community in Niger State. According to him, 13 persons from the same family were among the 22 abducted.
The District Head of Gurdi Chiefdom, Alhaji Bala Mohammed, confirmed the abduction of the farmers and burning of tractors but said he was yet to ascertain the number of the people abducted. The district head who lamented that his people were under siege as bandits usually invaded his community through Niger State said he had reported the latest kidnap incident to the police and the authorities of the Abaji Area Council. The Acting FCT Police spokesman, Omotayo Williams confirmed the incident. “It happened in Rafin Daji, a boundary community between Niger and the FCT. The farmers were on their farmland working when gunmen outnumbered and kidnapped them. Upon receipt of this information, a combined team of police officers from various tactical and intelligence units of the command, Destiny Hunters, vigilantes, and local hunters stormed the forest, combing it aggressively even as I speak for the rescue of the victims and to bring the perpetrators to book. Monitoring and surveillance of the community also continues,” he said.
