President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed Mr Iniobong Jeremiah Umana as Nigeria’s Ambassador-in-situ. This was conveyed in a letter signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Ugochukwu Onyeama, entitled: Conferment of Ambassador-in-situ. It read: “I have the honour and pleasure to inform you that Mr Buhari has approved your appointment as Ambassador-in-Situ. This is in recognition of the decades of your meritorious service to our fatherland in the Nigerian Foreign Service… “Please, accept the warm felicitations on behalf of myself, the Minister of State and the entire staff of the ministry.” Meanwhile, a statement by the President of Akwa Ibom State Association of Nigeria (Netherlands) AKISAN NL, Mr. Emmanuel Ekpenyong, lauded President Buhari for finding “our great son worthy of such appointment.” The group also felicitated with Umana, knowing full well that he is capable of performing excellently. The statement read in part: “We recall with nostalgia Umana’s stint in The Netherlands and how he deployed his resources to rally Akwa Ibom indigenes in that country to form a strong united union.  He also inspired the formation of our organisation, AKISAN NL. We are happy to be associated with this worthy leader, statesman, and benefactor. “We pray that God should grant him long life and good health, so he can use this exalted position to positively affect the lives of Nigerians in general and Akwa Ibom and Cross River indigenes in particular.
