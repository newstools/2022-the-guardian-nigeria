The National Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has destroyed illicit drugs worth over N1billion and weighing 17,000 kilogrammes in Ibadan.  He said: “To be destroyed today is an illicit drug haul weighing approximately 16,799kg, comprising 16,473kg of cannabis sativa,  four grammes of cocaine and 326kg of psychotropic substances. The worth of these substances is well over N1billion.  “We can hardly quantify the scale of the problem averted by preventing these substances from falling into wrong hands. We know too well the kinds of problems that result from the abuse of illicit substances just as we are aware that some of the challenges facing our society are due to in part to years of passivity towards matters of abuse and trafficking of illicit drugs. “Besides the escalation of the usual crimes of robbery, we have seen widespread insecurity manifesting in the form of banditry, kidnapping and insurgency to mention but a few, which have been disruptive to the socio-economic life of the country. In all of these, there is no discounting the role of abuse of illicit substances as an enabling factor.”
