A STEM Farm Project by Young Entrepreneurs’ Club of Caleb British International School has won $2,500 Ciena Solution Sustainability Award. The award is organised by Digital Promise, USA. A statement by the Director of Operations, Shola Adeola, explained that the Club set up a STEM farm; a hydroponic farm on the school premises to campaign against deforestation and for the community to embrace climate-smart agricultural systems as against traditional systems, which have proven to be environmentally unsustainable. According to her, the project enabled the students to learn problem-solving techniques and critical thinking, effective communication and collaboration and entrepreneurship. She said: “After the STEM Farm Project emerged as one of the 17 finalists out of over 400 entrepreneurial projects across the country on ‘Naija Climate Now’ competition, it has gone ahead to win several other awards and recognitions, notable among them is the $2,500 Ciena Solution Sustainable Award. “Since the launch in 2021, more than 200 teachers from schools and youth organisations across 48 countries have engaged with the Ciena Solutions Challenge, a global design challenge launched by Digital Promise and Ciena that invites middle and high school students globally to design solutions that address the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals within their communities.”
