In “Legalize,” produced by an international team including Michael Brun (Haiti/USA), E Kelly (Nigeria), and Nonso Amadi (Nigeria/Canada), Mr Eazi sings of his love for his fiancée Temi Oteldola. The couple had gotten engaged in April after Mr Eazi proposed while shooting the song’s music video in Venice, Italy. Recall that a few days ago, the couple opened up on their plans to have a very intimate wedding ceremony in a new episode of their podcast “How Far.” The couple agreed they needed only ten close family and friends at their wedding. Noting that their families are made up of private individuals, they revealed that Temi’s dad, billionaire businessman Femi Otedola suggested that they have a small wedding in the house.
