The police, yesterday, arraigned Suleiman Gbajabiamila, 62, before a Chief Magistrate’s Court 1, Yaba, Lagos, for allegedly defrauding a United Kingdom-based Nigerian man, Lateef Adeyemo, of the sum of N30 million.  “I realised he had defrauded me when he stopped picking our calls in January 2022. The guys that introduced him asked me not to worry because his brother is the Speaker of the House of Representatives. “I never knew he was a thief. He made a fake draft when I asked him to return my money and said he’s paid the money.
 
“The total money is N31 million because they collected N1 million as  commission, but it is not included.”
