Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja has permitted detained Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to file more evidence against the suit, FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022, filed by the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (OAGF) on behalf of the Federal Government, seeking his extradition to the United States to face trial for criminal charges. The court granted the request made through Kyari’s lead counsel, Nureni Jimoh (SAN), during consideration of a motion on notice. The lawyer, while arguing the application, prayed the court to allow his client to tender additional documentary exhibits to establish his innocence. Lawyer to the plaintiff, Pius Akuta, however, opposed  the request, predicting his opposition on the ground that it was an attempt to “cure deficiencies in the earlier documentary evidence adduced by the detained DCP Kyari.” In a brief ruling, yesterday, the presiding judge rejected the objection, stating that the court would have ample opportunity to determine the probate value to be attached to the extra evidence. Justice Ekwo, thereafter, fixed today for a definite hearing in the case initiated at the request of the American government for Kyari’s trial having been indicted in an alleged Internet fraud involving a Nigerian Instagram celebrity, Ramon Abbas (popularly known as Hushpoppi).
