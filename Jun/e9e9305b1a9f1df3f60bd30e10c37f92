•Promises quick resolution, okays job portal, NSITF’s digitisation The Federal Government, yesterday, distanced itself from reports making the rounds that it was contemplating different payment schedules for the various trade unions in tertiary institutions. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) had insisted on the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) being created, claiming that the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) was short-changing the teachers. Government, in March, said UTAS had failed three integrity tests. The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and Non-Academic Staff Union of Allied and Educational Institutions (NASU) also had Universities Peculiar Personnel Payroll System (UPPPS) as their variant. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, told reporters after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting (FEC), presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, in Abuja, that efforts were ongoing to resolve the crisis soon. He said contrary to insinuations that the government had ignored ASUU, there had been a series of meetings between concerned parties with the next one holding today. IN another development, the Federal Government said it has approved the opening of a job portal for Nigerians at home and abroad. Ngige, who also made the disclosure, said the digitisation of operations of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) had equally been approved by the government. He said his ministry presented two memos, stating: “The first was presented on behalf of our parastatal, NSITF.” He said e-NSITF would cost N1.2 billion. Ngige also said the council equally approved a portal, Nigerian Labour Exchange (NILEX) domiciled in his ministry, for employment and job creation.
