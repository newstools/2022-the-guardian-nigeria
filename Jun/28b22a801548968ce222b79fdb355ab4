APC Suffering From Pre-election Fever – PDP Contrary to claims that Igbo resident in Lagos State was being attacked, the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo insists that nothing could be farther from the truth.  He claimed that: “That action by the APC in Lagos is part of its desperate design to use violence to sabotage free, fair and credible elections in 2023 having realised that Nigerians have rejected its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu ahead of the polls.”
  
The PDP spokesman also alleged that “Asiwaju Tinubu has been in morbid fear of the soaring popularity of the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, hence the attempt by the APC to stop Nigerians from obtaining their PVCs to vote in the elections, an action that portends serious threat and danger to our democratic process.”
  
“Is it not an irony that the party of the government of the day that pretends to have the support of the people and professes continuity is busy chasing away prospective voters?” The statement queried, adding that the APC is already suffering from Pre-Election Fever Syndrome in trepidation that it cannot win in a free, fair, credible, and transparent process where Nigerians are allowed to freely express their will.”
