The United Nations (UN) has urged Nigeria to vigorously pursue the implementation of national climate change plans (including the Nationally Determined Contributions, Energy transition Plan and Climate Change Act) and ramp up its ambition towards meeting net-zero by 2060 goal.
   
The United Nations High Level Champion for COP26, Nigel Topping, made this call during a visit to Nigeria to engage with government on the implementation of national climate change plans.  Topping was appointed the UK Government’s High Level Climate Champion for COP 26 in January, 2020, to help drive action from businesses, investors, organisations, cities, and regions on climate change and coordinate this work with governments and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
