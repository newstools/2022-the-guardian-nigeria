Advocacy for Societal Rights Advancement and Development Initiative (ASRADI) has demanded the Certified True Copies (CTCs) of nomination forms of 2023 presidential candidates. The group, in a letter to the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, yesterday, urged him to release the Certified True Copies (CTCs) of nomination forms of 2023 presidential candidates. In the race are candidates of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi; New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, and others. In the letter signed by the Executive Director, Adeolu Oyinlola, ASRADI said the action was in furtherance of its duty to scrutinise the credentials of all candidates for the presidency in order to establish which claims are bonafide and which are false. ASRADI urged the commission to furnish them with the CTCs of the nomination forms (as well as all attached documents) of all candidates bidding to become president in 2023. They also gave the commission seven days to grant their application as prescribed by the Freedom of Application Act, 2011.
