Mehracki Token, $MKI, is a meme coin powering a robust utility and ecosystem. Many meme tokens follow the same route to maintain their viability in the crypto market. Mehracki was named after the truism of crypto minting and sought to invigorate the lost enthusiasm among crypto investors and users. Neo, formerly Antshares, is a blockchain protocol aimed at disrupting the crypto industry by introducing scalable smart money for digital assets. $NEO is looking to moon past its price range between $9 and $13 (taken in June 2022). How do we know this? You’ll find out in this article. Litecoin, LTC, is an open source protocol forked from Bitcoin as a lightweight network. It makes our list of cryptocurrencies with the potential of skyrocketing past its current price with a likely positive market sentiment. Let’s learn more about these cryptocurrencies below. Neo (NEO), the smart money crypto, ready to reclaim its glory Since launching in 2014, the Neo network has grown to become a top cryptocurrency in the crypto market. It has powered a good number of smart money cryptocurrencies, including partnering to launch the Nep-5 token, Ontology (ONT), in 2018. Neo has continually raised funds through token sales following the launch of its products or features. Its protocol has gained the attention of VCs, which has helped it expand its frontier to the Asian borders.<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1779711 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-893x598.jpg" alt="" width="893" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-893x598.jpg 893w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-1721x1152.jpg 1721w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-1536x1028.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-320x214.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-640x428.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64-600x402.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-64.png 2045w" sizes="(max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px" />  $NEO broke an all-time high of over $196 in 2018 but fell below $5 the same year. It broke another high over $133 from its last low in April 2021, then moved up to $140 in May the same year. Since its last high in 2021, $NEO has continued in a negative (downward) trend, which has sparked panic among investors. At its current ranging price (taken in Q2 2022), $NEO is showing signs of breaking its lower highs to at least $20 by the end of the year, which could be a profitable investment for those who invest at a nicely spotted buy position (this is not financial advice.) Litecoin (LTC), a simple but fast peer-to-peer network The success story of Litecoin (LTC) is incomplete without Bitcoin, from which it spun off. Litecoin is a faster but lighter version of Bitcoin (BTC) and can confirm transactions at a throughput rate of 56 transactions per second (TPS), which is way bigger than Bitcoin’s throughput of just 5 TPS. $LTC has been investors’ top choice since its inception hitting over $29 billion in market capitalisation in 2021, the same year it hit its all-time high of about $412. It has continued to gain investors’ traction despite its highs and lows.<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1779710 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-900x598.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-900x598.jpg 900w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-1733x1152.jpg 1733w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-1536x1021.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-640x425.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63-600x399.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-63.png 1744w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" />  From its price of about $60 (taken in June 2022), $LTC will likely break its current range of $55 and $84. This makes $LTC a promising coin by the end of 2022. With that in mind, you should carefully find a suitable price to enter Litecoin’s market. Mehracki Token (MKI), A meme token powering a DEX protocol Mehracki Token (MKI) is powering a decentralised exchange that will drive more liquidity to Mehracki’s ecosystem and enhance its market value. The token is currently undervalued at $0.000056 because it was just introduced to the market through a private token sale (presale). The presale will be in three stages, starting from May to August 2022, with the first phase almost concluded at the time of writing. During the presale stage, 30 billion MKI tokens (representing 30% of the total token supply) will be released, and the rest (70 billion) will be locked in a smart contract to be released during DEX listing or ICO.  <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1779707 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-1062x598.jpg" alt="" width="1062" height="598" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-1536x865.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62-600x338.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-62.png 1918w" sizes="(max-width: 1062px) 100vw, 1062px" />Mehracki will burn meme tokens not sold during the presale to maintain an increasing value for the $MKI token. This makes $MKI a potentially profitable token in the future (all things being equal).
