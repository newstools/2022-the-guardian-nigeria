A former senator representing Anambra Central, Ebenezer Ikeyina, yesterday, picked the presidential ticket of Social Democratic Party (SDP). The development might have sealed the chances of National Leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, crossing over, if he fails to clinch his party’s presidential ticket. While addressing delegates from the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory in Abuja during its national convention, the Acting SDP National Chairman, Chief Supo Shonibare, expressed optimism that the party’s candidates seeking various elective positions would be victorious during the 2023 general elections. According to the Chairman of the National Convention Organising Committee, Chief Mike Odunrinde, out of the 311 delegates accredited, 307 voted in favour of Ikeniya, two voted against, while only one vote was voided.
