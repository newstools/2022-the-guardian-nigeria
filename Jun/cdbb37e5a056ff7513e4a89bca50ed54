The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the global body for professional accountants has announced collaboration with FlexiSAF foundation and W.A.S.T.E Africa to unveil its ‘Recycle for education drive’ in Nigeria in commemoration of World Environment Day 2022. The drive is aimed at supporting vulnerable out-of-school children with access to basic education, through funding from waste recycling by its member community across Nigeria. According to ACCA Nigeria’s country head, Tom Isibor: ‘The collaboration aligns with ACCA’s decade-long commitments to the UN SDGs, including partnership for the goals (SDG17), to create awareness about recycling and its positive impact on the environment (SDG12), towards providing access to quality education (SDG4) in Nigeria.’ In the 2022 professional insights report on Accounting for a Better World by the ACCA, the report identifies seven core priorities for the profession, in contributing to economic recovery and sustainable development, adding that the evolving role of accountants and finance professionals positions them to drive change across economies and help build a better world. W.A.S.T.E Africa, a transformational organization for the advancement of waste management in Africa, in partnership with the FlexiSAF Foundation provides the platform for executing this project through its Bottle4Books initiative, which tackles both the rising issues of environmental litter and the alarming number of out of school children in the country. Founder of WASTE Africa, Ms. Olufunto Boroffice described the collaboration with ACCA as timely and impact-driven, acknowledging that it is a welcome development to its partnership with the FlexiSAF foundation, headed by Executive Director, Amina Abubakar. ACCA members across Nigeria will champion the drive for recyclables over a 3-month period, from June till September 2022, to empower WASTE Africa’s funding of a new year intake of students, managed by the FlexiSAF Foundation.
