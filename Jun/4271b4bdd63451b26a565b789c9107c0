This is expected, says spokesperson for the Department of Water and Sanitation Mr. Sputnik Ratau.  “The Department of Water and Sanitation is closely monitoring water levels and what we are seeing now as we go into the drier winter season, is that the weekly storage capacity of dams continues to decline, though not significantly so. The Department of Water and Sanitation urges all citizenry, industry, municipalities and all water services authorities to implement water use efficiency methods.” The Department of Water and Sanitations’ Status of Water Reservoirs report, indicates that the Full Capacity Supply (FSC) of the Northern Cape is this week at 107.4% full.
