Sequel to the dastardly killing of 40 people at St Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owaluwa, in Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State penultimate Sunday, traditional worshippers will be invoking curses on the culprits today ahead of the mass burial of victims tomorrow. In a public announcement made available to journalists in Akure, yesterday, by the Special Assistant Media to the Olowo of Owo, Mr Sam Adewale, the invocation by the worshippers of god of Iron, Ogun, would not restrict movement of persons. Adewale explained that the attack on 127 worshippers by the unknown gunmen on June 5, necessitated the invocation of Ogun curses on perpetrators of the gruesome attack on Owo community. He revealed that there has been prior notice “concerning the planned invocation of ‘god of Iron’ (Ogun) curses on perpetrators of the attack on the Catholic Church in Owo few days ago. “I am directed to inform the general public that, though, the traditional step being taken by worried stakeholders in the community, concerns all and sundry in the land, which hitherto require the cooperation of everybody. “But this scheduled traditional step for tomorrow, does not in any way disturb the normal daily routine of inhabitants and visitors alike in the ancient town, as there would be no restrictions to human and vehicular movements.” He appealed to the people to “note that, even the designated areas where the people in charge of the invocation are to perform the necessary rituals, are also free for movements but it is only that, there would be strict traffic control. “To this end, no member of the public is disturbed to carry out his or her lawful economic and social activities as the programme will only last for one hour. Therefore, you are advised to go about your daily activities without any molestation,” the statement read.
