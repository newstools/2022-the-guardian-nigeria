Nigerians displaced in the North-East, who are still in Cameroon would be coming home soon as the Presidential Committee on the Repatriation, Returns and Resettlement of Displaced Persons in the North-East, has ordered the immediate resumption of their repatriation.
 
Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who is Chairman of the Committee, gave the directive on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, during a meeting of the Committee, where Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, the Vice Chairman of the Committee, presented the report of the Technical Working Group (TWG) on repatriation of Nigerians displaced from the North-East. There are thousands of Nigerian refugees in the neighboring countries of Chad, Niger and Cameroon who are due for repatriation to their homes in Nigeria. Prior to the inauguration of the Presidential Committee, the National Commission For Refugees, Migrants, and IDPs (NCFRMI) in collaboration with other agencies had repatriated over 4000 displaced Nigerians from Cameroon before halting the operation. Prof Osinbajo directed that, while the Presidential Committee reviewed the report of the TWG, the Refugees Commission should without further delay resume the repatriation of displaced Nigerians from the Republic of Cameroon it had previously commenced.
 
The Vice President noted that the repatriation and resettlement of Nigerians displaced in Cameroon and other neighbouring countries as a result of the insurgency in the North-East remains a priority, hence, the Refugees Commission and other relevant agencies must ensure that the objective was achieved.
 
Speaking to State House Correspondents later, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, who presented the report of the Technical Working Group at the meeting urged authorities to expedite the repatriation exercise, saying, “Within the last few years, we have repatriated no fewer than 50, 000 people but we still have more than 200,000.”
 
He said he looked forward to the presidential approval to facilitate funding and other logistics required for the re-establishment of the affected communities in Borno State, noting that the security situation has greatly improved.
