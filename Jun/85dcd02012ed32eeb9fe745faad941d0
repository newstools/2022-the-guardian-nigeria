The solution to fuel scarcity in Gombe State and the entire country may not be in sight as the Independent Petroleum Markers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has accused the federal government of insensitivity and double standards. The union disclosed that its members in Gombe State no longer access petroleum products easily and lamented that: “the scarcity is really affecting our members, most of them are out of job now and we have made representations to our zonal office for onward submission to Abuja.” Chairman of the Gombe State branch of the association, Abdu Ibrahim Mohammed told newsmen that unless the federal government reduces the pump price of diesel, long queues and oil racketeering will continue and never cease. He lamented that the diesel pump price that jumped from N200 to N800 has affected supply and availability of Petroleum products in the state, said: “at that exorbitant price, we can no longer fuel our trucks to lift fuel in the south. “This is aside other logistics like tyre to be considered in the process,” Mohammed said. He added that government no longer pays the fright rate to cover undue expenses for transporting the products from South down to the north. According to him, “Government is owing us over a year freight rate, once it settles this, I assure you that fuel will return to the state.”
