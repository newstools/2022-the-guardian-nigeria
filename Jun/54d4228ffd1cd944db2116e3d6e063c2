Ahead of the 2023 general elections, National Chairman of African Democratic Congress (ADC), Chief Ralph Nwosu, has decried monetisation of the ongoing electioneering process. Addressing the party’s third Presidential Aspirants’ Forum, with the theme,  “Leading forward with knowledge-driven collegiate presidency,” yesterday, in Abuja, he said the development was making a mockery of the country’s democracy. The ADC chief reiterated the party’s resolve to rescue Nigeria from the elite, “who are neck bent on frustrating the electorate and the masses as a whole from choosing the leaders that would reposition the country.” The Anambra State-born politician assured Nigerians that his party would not lower standards for moneybags. He appreciated the party’s 12 presidential aspirants for their posture towards nation building prowess and teamwork. Hopefuls, who were at the event, where Nwosu announced a June 8 date for ADC’s national convention in Abuja, included Dr. Mani Ibrahim; Joyce Ogochukwu Nsaka; Dr. Chike Okogwu; Dr. Chukwuka Monye; Lady Angela Johnson; Prof. Kingsley Moghalu; Dumebi Kachikwu; Princess Chichi Ojei and Dr. Muhammed Lamido. Others are Bishop Ify-George Oforkansi; Dr. Favour Ayodele and Evang. Ebiti Ndok Jegede.
