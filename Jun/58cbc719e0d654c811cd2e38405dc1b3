Buga’s mellow calm didn’t simply revolutionize, but also created a dancing move that inspires listeners to keep their heads high. The song’s lyrics also won over a lot of fans since some regarded them as proof that hard effort pays off at the same time saying “work hard, play hard.”
The carnival-themed music video featuring Tekno is eye-catching in every sense, filled with vibrant colours and beautiful ladies dancing. Ushering the video, viewers are introduced to the first group of dancers, adorned in the emblematic colours of green and white dancing with their dark shades on, while other ladies are dressed in winged and colourful costumes from their hair to every other item worn. The music which cheers people on to relax after so much work is all shades of relaxing to watch. Sabinus in his usual character is comedic as he busts some moves and is later seen holding up the Cameroon flag with other countries flag flying high in the music video. Kizz Daniel is seen in a red and black loose leopard outfit, while Tekno is themed in a black and white outfit. Buga’s video begins in the daytime and slips into the night. The carnival-themed “Buga” could just be a reveal of what the singer might have planned out in his hopes and desire after he tweeted “God I want to perform BUGA for World Cup with a mass choir, help me say amen” and got over 10, 000 retweets.
