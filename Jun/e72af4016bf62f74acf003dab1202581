Tottenham announced the signing on Friday of midfielder Yves Bissouma from Brighton for a reported fee of £25 million ($30 million), giving manager Antonio his third signing of the transfer window. The highly rated Mali international shone as Brighton achieved their best-ever Premier League finish of ninth last season. Bissouma has signed a four-year deal and will join new arrivals Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster at the London club. “The transfer is a very good one for the club and player,” said Brighton manager Graham Potter. “Yves has shown his undoubted ability and been an important player for us during his time with us. “Now he has a new challenge with Tottenham, including the opportunity to play Champions League football, and everyone at the club wishes him well.”
