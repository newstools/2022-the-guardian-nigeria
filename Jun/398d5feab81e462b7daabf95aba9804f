• Fuel scarcity gets messier as depots run out of stock
• Independent marketers push for hike, sell at N180-N200/litre
• Northern youths lament scarcity, demand sack of Sylva, Kyari
• NLC: Nigerians paying heavily for darkness with failed privatisation Barely one week after President Muhammadu Buhari approved an additional N10 for transporters of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) across the country, petroleum marketers have decried the prolonged inability to load from NNPC depots, leaving them to depend on private depots that equally impose additional charges.  According to findings, depots, which included NIPCO, AITEO, Ardova, among others located in Apapa were all out of stock as at 2:00p.m. yesterday. Some of the depot operators said there was a shortage in supply from the supplier of last resort: NNPC. MEANWHILE, majority of the Independent Petroleum filling stations have unofficially increased the cost of fuel from N165 per litre to N200. They maintained that they are not certain at what cost they would get the commodity when it is eventually available at the depots. Some motorists, who spoke to The Guardian, decried the resurgence in fuel scarcity, saying it has disrupted their daily schedules. “I left home around 6:00a.m. with the hope that I would be able to get fuel at any of the filling stations along Ogunnusi Road, Ojodu. To my disappointment, none of the filling stations along the axis sold fuel. “I and many others queued up at the filling station around FRSC office in Ojodu because the attendants told us they were expecting stock. I left after waiting for about two hours without any sign that they would soon get fuel,” one of the motorists, a civil servant, lamented. Another resident said the fuel scarcity has further worsened the traffic gridlock on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway following long queues at filling stations near Lagos. “In the whole of my area around Berger, Arepo, Ibafo, there is no fuel. This is beside the fact that we have not had light for the past three days,” the resident said.
   
The Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) told The Guardian that although the President approved the upward review of the transportation claim, the new rate has yet to take effect, forcing haulage companies to park their vehicles instead of incurring losses due to the high cost of diesel.  IN April, while approving a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year, the National Assembly approved N4 trillion fuel subsidy budget.
   
Amid heavy borrowing, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had in fact said with fuel subsidy payout averaging N500 billion monthly, Nigeria may spend N6 trillion to subsidise petrol before the end of this year. 
  
While it is now clear that the Russia-Ukraine war may linger indefinitely as Nigeria has been unable to maintain oil production targets, stakeholders fear that the fuel crisis may go from bad to worse, adding that NNPC may be unable to meet with its Direct Sale, Direct Purchase scheme. The scheme enables the country to swap crude oil for refined products.
   
In Abuja yesterday, most fuel stations belonging to the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) and Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), including Total, Mobil, Eternal and others were shut, while a handful that sold the product dispensed from few pumps.  While motorists struggle for the product, black marketers have since returned to the nation’s capital, with a litre selling for about N400.
   
A motorist, Yaro Abdurazaq, while lamenting the situation, said there was need to urgently address the “unbearable challenge.”
On Kubwa expressway and parts of the city, especially Jabi, Wuyi, Wuse, Central Business District, Garki and others, few filling stations were dispensing. On the airport axis, Shema filling station was without fuel. NIPCO was dispensing amid a long queue. Dan oil was under lock and key, The A.Y Shafa, adjacent to Dunamis Church, was also under lock, as well as Mobil.
   
Chairman MOMAN and Managing Director, 11 Plc, Tunji Oyebanji, had earlier decried the postponement of full deregulation of the downstream sector, stressing that liberalisation of the sector will enable investors across the value chain to have adequate returns on their investments.
   
Executive Director of Rainoil Ltd., Emmanuel Omuojine, equally noted the need to remove subsidies on petrol. Asking government to take the right step on subsidy, Omuojine said removing subsidy would add significant value to Nigeria’s foreign exchange reserves on the macroeconomic level.  FOLLOWING lingering problem of fuel scarcity and the pathetic situation of the nation’s petroleum sector, Northern youth groups have called for the immediate sack of critical stakeholders, including Sylva, for poor handling of the sector and the pains they have inflicted on Nigerians. The Amalgamation of Arewa Youths Groups (AAYG), an umbrella body of 225 socio-cultural and socio-religious body in the North, yesterday, expressed dismay over lingering fuel scarcity in the country and called for an overhaul of the oil sector. The secretary and spokesman of AAYG, Comrade Abubakar Musa Ardo and Victor Duniya respectively, said “Nigerians are currently battling with the excruciating pains of fuel scarcity, the situation has remained like this for the significant part of 2022, with no end in sight. “Where you manage to see little of the fuel, it sells between N250 and N300 per litre in broad daylight without fear of government regulatory agencies. This is against the national benchmark and highly subsidised rate of N165.” Ardo said: “As critical stakeholders in the Nigerian project, we can’t continue to fold our hands and allow things degenerate to point of no return. There is no justification for this scarcity amid abundant blessings of crude oil in most parts of Country, that are both tapped and untapped.” Besides, he remarked, “during the previous scarcity in the early part of this year, both the NNPC and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) accused some major importers of importing high methanolic contaminated PMS, with the promise of bringing the said companies to justice, however till date, nobody has been punished for inflicting pains on Nigerians. “It is against this backdrop that we call on Mr President to wield the big stick on the trio of Mr Timipre Sylva; NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari and MD NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed for clear acts of sabotage and an attempt to pitch Nigerians against him.” The group also called on the National Assembly to probe the subsidy regime and compare notes with previous years to unearth the rigged figure by both NNPC and NMDPRA, and ensure that all those concerned are punished. “If our demands are not met in the next five working days, we shall organise our members to occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across our region and the FCT until we see changes. This is not just a mere threat. We will follow up with full action after the expiration of our ultimatum,” the Northern group added. IN a related development, President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayuba Wabba, has criticised the privatisation policy of the Federal Government, especially in the power sector, insisting that Nigerians are being forced to pay for darkness. Wabba made the claims on Monday at the maiden edition of Nigeria Employers Summit 2022 organised by the Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) in Abuja. Wabba, who was represented by the Deputy President of NLC, Najeem Usman Yasin, lamented that the development will continue unless the national infrastructural gaps are addressed. He said: “The recent slump in the national electricity supply, which is a result of constant failure of our electricity grid indicates that Nigeria still has a long way to go in making power supply available to the citizenry. “The organised private sector has concluded that the state of public electricity supply as of today, has shown that most productive and residential areas in Nigeria no longer enjoy up to six hours of electricity supply. “This has confirmed that the recent privatisation of Nigeria’s power sector is a complete failure.
“Nigerians still pay heavily for megawatts of darkness.” NLC, however, urged government to consider a reversal of the privatisation of the power sector and return assets to Nigerians.
