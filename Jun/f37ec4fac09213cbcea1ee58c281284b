Four days after jumping 6.89 metres to win the gold medal at the National Trials in Benin City, reigning African women long jump champion, Ese Brume, is eyeing ‘improved performance’ this evening as the Diamond League berths in Sweden. Brume and her coach, Kayode Yahaya, left Benin City, the venue of the national trials, for Sweden on Monday to compete in the lucrative Diamond League, her second appearance this season. This year, Brume, who has a way of grabbing a medal for Nigeria, in any event, participates since she broke into the limelight in 2013, and competed in the Diamond League at Oregon, United States, where she jumped 6.85 metres. Speaking with The Guardian from Stockholm, Sweden, Brume stated that her target this evening is to improve on her previous performance. “I am in Sweden to improve myself. Thank God I am here with my coach,” Brume stated. The Guardian recalls that Brume recorded an impressive outing at the Doha Diamond League in 2020, where she finished second in the long jump event after a commendable leap of 6.68m (+0.4m/s) in the final. Brume won Nigeria’s only medal at the last World Athletics Championship held in Doha. She also grabbed a bronze medal for Team Nigeria at the Tokyo Olympics and a bronze at the 2022 Indoor Championship in Belgrade.
