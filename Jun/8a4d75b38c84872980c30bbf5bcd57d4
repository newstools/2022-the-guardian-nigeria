Ekiti State workers, under the auspices of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), have issued a 21-day ultimatum to the state government to pay all arrears of salary, deductions and promotion, failing which industrial harmony would no longer be guaranteed. The TUC, in a statement  in Ado-Ekiti, yesterday, after the union’s State Executive Council (SEC) meeting and signed by its state Chairman, Sola Adigun, urged Governor Kayode Fayemi to pay all the backlog of arrears of salaries as promised during his electioneering campaign in 2018 before the expiration of his tenure on October 15, 2022. The labour union said redeeming such pledge would further reinforce workers’ trust in the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in Ekiti and smoothen relationship with the incoming governor, Mr. Biodun Oyebanji. The TUC, which congratulated Oyebanji on his victory at the just-concluded governorship polls, urged him to be magnanimous in victory by being inclusive in governance and forming robust alliance with the opposition to build Ekiti of his dream. It also condemned the rate of kidnapping of citizens in the state, urging Fayemi to devise means to curtail the nefarious act that is threatening peaceful co-existence and investments’ drive.
