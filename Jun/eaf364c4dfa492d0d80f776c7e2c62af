The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has established collaboration with the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club (LLTC) to initiate a sensitisation campaign on the importance of insurance through sports. The two organisations, in a meeting held at the LLTC’s premises in Lagos, mapped out modalities to engage all sports lovers to subscribe to insurance products that would mitigate risks on the field, especially, the compulsory insurance offered by underwriters in the country. Speaking at the gathering, the President of NCRIB, Rotimi Edu, said that the council would leverage the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club to organise a Lawn Tennis tournament as part of its 60th Anniversary and will give out mouthwatering prices to all participants. According to him, participants at the two-day tournament, which is slated for June 18 and 19, would cut across the entire insurance industry.
