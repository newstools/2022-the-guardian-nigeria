Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned that those still owing ground rent in Abuja, which amounts to N29 billion, risk prosecution, revocation, or outright forfeiture of property. It noted that it set up the coordinating committee because after several appeals and notices to the affected property owners, they remained adamant. FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr. Adesola Olusade, recently inaugurated a debt recovery committee with the mandate to recover debts for the FCTA, with a particular interest in ground rents and sundry fees in land administration. The committee is expected to formally start communicating to the affected persons and corporate bodies from tomorrow (July 1), after which those who fail to pay would be prosecuted. A statement in Abuja, yesterday, by the FCTA Director, Information and Communication/Chairman, Media and Publicity Sub-Committee of the Coordinating Committee, disclosed that the administration was forced to adopt the measures due to the non-compliance of property owners. “Government, therefore, wishes that the affected debtors will come forward and clear their outstanding to avoid prosecution, revocation and forfeiture of their property. “The Recovery Committee has already swung into action and perfected modalities towards achieving this onerous task because the government needs resources to execute essential infrastructural projects in the FCT.” According to him, the committee, which has since been meeting to fine-tune strategies for the task ahead, also warned debtors of the consequences of allowing the committee to fully execute its mandate, by refusing to pay the land fees. “The committee wishes to assure that it will rigorously carry out its mandate to the letter because no stone will be left unturned in carrying out the assignment,” the statement added.
