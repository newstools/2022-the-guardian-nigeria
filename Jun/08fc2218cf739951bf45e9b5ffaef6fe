During the six-week trial, Vasquez earned notoriety for her cross-examination of Amber Heard.
Vasquez has been promoted to partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick, according to a tweet from the firm. “We are pleased to announce that Camille Vasquez has been elevated to partner. She was a key member of the litigation team that won a jury verdict last week for actor #JohnnyDepp in his defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard,” the tweet said. In delight, Vasquez said, “I am delighted that Brown Rudnick has given me its full vote of confidence by having me join the partnership. I’m proud of the uniquely talented team I’ve had the privilege to lead, which exemplified teamwork and collaboration, and I look forward to continuing to represent Brown Rudnick’s culture of excellence.” The law company claimed in a statement put alongside the tweet that they have traditionally saved this news until the end of the fiscal year. “But Camille’s performance during the Johnny Depp trial proved to the world that she was ready to take this next step now. We are incredibly proud of her and look forward to what she will accomplish as our newest partner.” Fans who were in awe of her cross-examination skills sent congratulatory messages that read, “Congratulations Camille and the Firm. The whole team did a splendid job. Very impressed with the presentation of the case which was precise, compelling and succinctly delivered. We his fans, Johnny’s relatives, owe your team an enormous heartfelt thanks.” Ms Vasquez had successfully cross-examined Ms Heard during the trial, with one of the highlights being when she asked the ‘Aquaman’ actor if the 7 million dollar divorce settlement had been donated to charity as promised.
