Analysts at Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “The bullish run witnessed in April due to the impressive Q1 results seen across board spilled into May, as the market consolidated on April’s 5.69 per cent gain to post a return of 8.05 per cent. “The positive close was possible despite the profit taking seen towards the end of the month as selected large-cap names like AIRTELAFRI which gained 27.49 per cent m/m lifted market performance. We are likely to see continued profit taking across board creating buy interest in some of the fundamentally sound names, while large-cap names continue to dictate market direction.” Nigerian Breweries topped the losers’ chart, dropping by 9.96 per cent to close at N62.40 kobo.
