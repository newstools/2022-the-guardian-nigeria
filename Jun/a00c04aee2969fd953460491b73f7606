No fewer than 14 people were confirmed dead, while 14 others were injured in two separate road crashes in Gombe State.  The 26-year-old driver of the trailer now on admission at the State Specialist Hospital, Gombe, said: “I actually tried but I couldn’t just stop the vehicle, it was too late when I realised the brake was no longer functional.”
