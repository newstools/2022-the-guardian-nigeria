The International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed Nigeria as host of Africa region qualifiers for the 2024 ICC Men’s U-19 Cricket World Cup from September 21 to October 2, 2022. The qualifiers, which will hold in Abuja, will produce only one qualifier to the next stage, who will then compete with qualifiers from the division one category. Already, the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), has started preparing the country’s team for the competition, which was confirmed by NCF General Manager, Emeka Igwilo, at the weekend. “The NCF Women T20 Invitational, earlier in the year, was a good test of our readiness for high ticket events, which the country stands to attract owing to her growing influence on the continent. Hence, we have a template to rinse adjust and repeat with,” he said. He added that the present NCF board has demonstrated willingness and capacity to work with the international body in hosting events of this nature going by the capacity building and continuous infrastructure upgrade it has undertaken. “We have two cricket pitches in Abuja that can host these matches. Edo and Lagos also have two world-class pitches, as well. And all these were upgraded in the last two years,” he added. He said the full list and schedule of the matches would be confirmed soon.
