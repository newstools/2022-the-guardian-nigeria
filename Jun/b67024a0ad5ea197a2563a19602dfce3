SkillUp Africa has stressed the need for Nigerian youths to learn globally viable skills to start their journey into the digital world, saying this is key to the success of developed countries.
  
Skillup Africa is a digital skills empowerment institution focused on making good quality tech education available to young Africans while connecting the talents to opportunities globally.
   
The provost of the tech institution, Temitayo Adegoke urged the government and well-meaning Nigerians to shift their focus from offering motorcycle empowerment to the youths and focus on technology emancipation.
 
According to him, there is an urgent need for the government to create opportunities to increase the capacity of the people, to solve the many challenges confronting the country.  He added that since 2013, the institute has impacted over 20,000 youth via several programmes targeted at teaching one or more tech skills.
 
He said: “For several years, I struggled with finding good quality resources locally to fill roles at my company. Although there are always tons of young Africans applying for jobs, the majority of them do not have the right skills. This was so frustrating that I decided to pick some of the young unskilled graduates seeking job openings, housed them in my home and trained them.
  
“In few months, they were very advanced with the knowledge and were interning at my firm. I did this with a second batch of young people and even got a better result. Then in 2019, together with a team of people committed to this mission Skillup Africa was launched in six locations in Lagos and a major campus in Epe offering evening and weekend classes.”
  
Adegoke stated that in 2020, the first Cohort of the Skillup Africa’s (then graduate) Training programme started with 17 fellows and the programme is currently in its fourth cohort.
