 Launched today, OCHA's Annual Report covers a year of deepening humanitarian need.  The report takes stock of OCHA’s actions and activities during 2021 as the number of people in need grew due to conflicts in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen, the hunger crisis in Madagascar and South Sudan, and the cyclone and earthquake in Haiti. It highlights how OCHA was able to mobilize US$20.1 billion through UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals — a 6.4 per cent increase from the $18.9 billion raised in 2020. Thanks to donors’ generous support, the UN and partners reached 107 million people with some form of assistance. The report also highlights the contributions of Member States and other UN and civil-society partners in ensuring that the most vulnerable people in crises received timely and quality humanitarian assistance.
