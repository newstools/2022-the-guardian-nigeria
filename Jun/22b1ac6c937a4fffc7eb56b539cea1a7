There was confusion at the premises of the Osun State University Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, yesterday, when suspected hoodlums stormed the hospital to demand unconditional release of some corpses at the morgue.
  
It was gathered that the hoodlums arrived the hospital at about 9:00a.m. and threatened to cause trouble if the corpses of their colleagues were not released to them.
 
Eyewitnesses said that the hoodlums refused entreaties by the hospital management to bring in security agents before the corpses could be claimed.  MEANWHILE, the hospital management yesterday shut its gates for few minutes to prevent breakdown of law and order in the hospital as the hoodlums insisted on taking the corpses, without payment or wait for security agency’s authorisation.
 
Calm was said to have returned to the hospital and its environs when some armed security agents arrived the scene and dispersed the hoodlums.
 
Contacted, Shittu confirmed that the hoodlums invaded the hospital and harassed doctors and nurses on duty.
 
He, however, said that normalcy had returned to the hospital.
