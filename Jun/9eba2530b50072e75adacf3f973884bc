Only about 1 out of every 5 people in tech are women. To further close this gender gap, Stutern has launched the African Tech Sis Scholarship to encourage more women to pursue careers in technology.  The scholarship will provide 2000 women with a 50% discount and a deferred payment option when they enroll in any of Stutern’s courses with 0 Naira and pay after they get a job. Stutern is an Edtech firm that offers training and helps young people get jobs in the tech industry. Till date, Stutern has worked with close to 1,000 alumni who are now working with leading technology teams in Africa and beyond. Many of the graduates are able to work remotely and majority of them are earning industry standard salaries.

Our alumni have taken different job roles in different locations around the world, such as Olayinka Fadare, who is a UX Designer at Randstad, Amsterdam; Eleanor Ezimah, a Product Designer at Truebill, Maryland, USA; and Eniola Aminu, who is currently a Product Designer at Flutterwave. Ayowole Adenuga also went from being a Zoologist to becoming a Software Engineer at Interswitch, one of Nigeria’s biggest payment infrastructures through Stutern.

Under the Challenge Fund for Youth Employment (CFYE) program, Stutern has partnered with the Netherlands government to bring in 2000 women into tech by 2023. This program is designed to equip women between the ages of 18 and 35 who are graduates, NYSC corps members, or looking to transition into tech with skills in UI/UX Design, Frontend development, Backend Development, Data Science, Mobile Development – React Native, Software Testing,  Developer Operations and soon Blockchain.  Stutern’s program allows people with little or no prior knowledge of technology to kickstart their careers with no upfront costs. The learning model accommodates recent university graduates, people who are currently in between jobs, and also individuals who are in a different field but looking to pivot into tech. It is 100% online, which allows people to learn from anywhere at any time. However, provisions have been made for individuals who prefer to learn from a physical location in these various states (Lagos, Edo, and Abuja), with access to power supply, internet access, laptops, and also in-person support for tasks and projects. Stutern’s mission, with this new initiative, is to ensure that women are not left behind. We also believe that in order to make a difference where we have discovered a loophole, we must lead the efforts ourselves. We are also open to partnerships with female-focused communities and NGOs to improve female representation in tech. 

The next cohort begins on June 27th, 2022, and you can apply directly by clicking this link.
