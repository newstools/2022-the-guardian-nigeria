According to the news and entertainment outlet Univision, there is more gossip concerning Pique’s “special gal” regarding the discord now being released by the newspaper El Periodico. Pique’s new girlfriend, according to the media site, was the relationship’s breaking point. “She’s 22 years old, blonde, a student, and a model for events.” The love affair was exposed by journalists Laura Fa and Lorena Vazquez. Even though their assertions were correct, their work was, however, criticised by the public because, at the time, Shakira and Pique had not declared their breakup. Pique visited the 22-year-old mystery woman several times since their first meeting, according to Laura Fa and Lorena Vazquez. Pique and his new lover reconnected at La Traviesa, a well-known nightclub. La Traviesa, located in Tuset, Barcelona, is a well-known nighttime destination in the city. Pique’s new girlfriend, according to both journalists, has removed her social media accounts. But, her sources revealed that she had over 300 Instagram posts. The new girlfriend’s name, according to Fa and Vazquez, starts with the letter C.
