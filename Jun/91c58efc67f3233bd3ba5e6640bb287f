SIR: Failure of Nigerians to deploy technology in most key areas has always been responsible for our inability to know how to set about solving some of the major problems confronting us as a nation. The Sunday attack and killing of innocent worshippers in the Catholic Church in Owo is quite unfortunate and shows how insecure we all are as Nigerians. But since this is not the first time such dastardly act is happening, it should not have met us so unprepared. The problem with us as a people is that we always think we are safe and secure in our own environment and what is happening to others cannot get to us. If not, as soon as reports about attacks on worship centres began making the headlines, all religious leaders ought to have invested in CCTV cameras to monitor movements in and out of their building environment especially whenever there is a large gathering of people. If that has been done, it would have been easier to see the faces of those behind the new heinous crime. Even with a mask, it will still have been possible to detect their identities from their physique, stature and clothing. Remember that in the case of Offa bank robbery, what assisted in the arrest of the suspects was their coverage by the bank’s CCTV cameras. What has happened in Owo should therefore be a great lesson to all religious leaders across the country. Mounting of CCTV cameras must now be seen as very important.
