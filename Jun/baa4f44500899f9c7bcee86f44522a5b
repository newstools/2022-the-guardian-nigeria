StarTimes has promised to air the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier between Super Eagles and São Tomé & Príncipe by 2.00 p.m. live and in HD on its World Football channel. Nigeria kicked off their qualifying campaign on a winning note after coming from behind to defeat the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone 2-1 at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja, on Thursday evening. But São Tomé and Príncipe began their qualification campaign on an unimpressive manner, as they lost 5-1 to Guinea-Bissau. Ex-Nigeria midfielder Henry Nwosu has warned the Super Eagles against underrating Sao Tome and Principe in their next Group A 2023 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. Meanwhile, Rangers midfielder, Joe Aribo, believes he and his teammates will improve after their 2-1 victory against Sierra Leone. “It’s our first game with our coach, with all of us together, we are going to improve, and we are going to get better in the games to come. We can always improve, we are definitely going to get better and stronger in the games to come,” he said.
