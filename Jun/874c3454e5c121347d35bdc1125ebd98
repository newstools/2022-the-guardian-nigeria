The Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Lagos, The Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins, and Bishop, Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Hassan Kukah, yesterday, called on Nigerians to take the 2023 general election very seriously.
  
They also tasked them to jettison sentiments and tribalism, and vote for credible leaders that would take the country out of woods.
