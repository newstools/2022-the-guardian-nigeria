Recover AK-47 rifle, nine motorcycles A combined team of police and military operatives, yesterday, foiled an operation by bandits on the Kaduna–Abuja highway. The team killed one of the bandits and recovered one AK47 rifle along with nine operational motorcycles. Police spokesman in Kaduna State, Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incident in a statement issued in Kaduna. Jalige said: “The dividends of the renewed vigour and purposeful synergy between the police and the military in Kaduna State came to the fore, yet again, on Monday, June 13, 2022, about 0255hrs when the combined team of Operation Puff Adder of the police and Operation Thunder Strike of the army, while on routine patrol along Kaduna–Abuja highway at Sabon Sara had an encounter with armed bandits, who were on their nefarious mission along the busy highway. “The marauding armed bandits were intercepted at the above-mentioned point, where exchange of fire ensued as a result of which the friendly forces succeeded in truncating the bandits’ mission, forcing them to retreat into the forest, as one bandit was neutralised.” Following the recovery of the rifle and motorcycles, upon search of the general area, the operatives moved to ensure the safety of motorists and other road users. “The Commissioner of Police, Kaduna State, Yekini Ayoku, assured the officers that their sacrifices towards ensuring public safety would not go unrewarded.” “As it is expected that the injured criminal elements will be hibernating around the nearby communities to access healthcare services, the CP called on the general public to report any person or group nursing gunshot wound to the nearest security formation as he assured them of prompt response at all times,” it said.
