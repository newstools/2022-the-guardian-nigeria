The Ikeja Unique Lions Club has built a block of six rooms toilet facility at African Church Primary School, Meiran, Lagos State, to improve the hygiene of the pupils of the school. President of the club, Oriyomi Adetunji, who disclosed this during the commissioning of the facility, said the club was committed to offering community services to the society. According to him, the club spent about N6.5 million on the project. He said the Lions Club initially wanted to build classrooms for the school, but  the teachers identified toilets as the pressing need of the pupils. Adetunji said adequate plan had been put in place to ensure proper management of the facility. Head teacher of the school, Mrs. Janet Obayemi, commended the club for the humanitarian gesture, saying the project is beyond expectation.
