The statement reads: “The general public is hereby notified that failure of the owner(s) of the aforementioned trucks to submit themselves for prosecution within 15 days of this publication, the said order shall become absolute. “NSCDC is not for war but for a peaceful rebirth of Nigeria, proactive enough to prevent and forestall the unexpected, which is far better than any professional prescription to cure, rescue or ameliorate any unfortunate circumstances.”
