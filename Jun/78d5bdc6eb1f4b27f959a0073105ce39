A mild drama, yesterday, played out on the floor of the upper legislative chamber when the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, switched off the public address system attached to Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC: Imo West) during screening of ministerial nominees. Lawan’s action followed an attempt by Okorocha to interrogate one of the ministerial nominees, Goodluck Nana Opiah, representing Imo State. In an ensuing shouting march, the Imo ex-governor demanded to know why Lawan gave another lawmaker, Francis Onyewuchi Ezennwa, a chance to speak when he was denied. Countering Okorocha’s appeal to question the nominee, the Senate President cautioned him against breaching the agreement reached in the chamber’s closed-door session. Shortly after his screening, Opiah told journalists that there  was no ‘bad blood’ between him and the senator, insisting, however, that the ex-governor meant well. Opiah was former Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly and member representing Ohaji/Egbema, Oguta and Oru West Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives. He is currently Commissioner for Petroleum Resources. Others confirmed by the Senate are Ikoh Ikechukwu, Abia; Umana Umana, Akwa Ibom; Ekumankama Nkama, Ebonyi; Umar El-Yakub, Kano; Ademola Adegoroye, Ondo and Odum Udi of Rivers State. Consequently, the Red Chamber adjourned for the next three weeks for the Sallah break. IN another development, upper legislative chamber resolved to send a high-powered delegation to erstwhile Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who is facing case of alleged organ harvest in the United Kingdom. Lawan dropped the hint at plenary after the Senate emerged from a closed-door session, which lasted for about one hour. He said the delegation, which comprises members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, would leave for London tomorrow. The Senate President also mandated the committee to engage the British High Commission in Nigeria for more details on the case.
