As has become custom, Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board is set to mark the World Milk Day by hosting a series of in-store and online campaigns throughout Africa to celebrate the richness and health benefits of Irish dairy.
Milk is an important part of a healthy, balanced diet for each individual and the annual World Milk Day provides the perfect opportunity to spread the word. In the last few years, Bord Bia has championed the cause and this year is no exception. The theme for this year’s World Milk Day campaign is “Dairy Net Zero” and Bord Bia is partnering with Irish dairy brand, Kerrygold to help promote milk consumption in Africa for the month of June. According to Nicolas Ranninger, Bord Bia’s Regional Director for Africa, “We want to celebrate the richness of Irish dairy and Ireland on World Milk Day. Irish dairy has premium quality, and superior taste, and is sustainably produced from grass fed cows. Irish dairy cows’ diet consists mainly of grass – which is rich in natural beta carotene and that’s why Irish butter and cheeses are distinctly yellow in colour and tasty – naturally.”

And Africa, being a key market for Irish food and beverage exports and in particular for Irish dairy companies, shouldn’t be left out of the campaign.”
