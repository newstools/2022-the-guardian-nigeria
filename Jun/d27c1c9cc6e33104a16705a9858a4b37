Bandits demand N150m to free Plateau monarch
The mother of Tijjani Gaya, the All Progressives Congress (APC) senatorial candidate for Jigawa Central, has been abducted. Hajiya Jaja, who is estimated to be 70 years old, was abducted from her house in Kiyawa Local Council in Jigawa State. Confirming the incident, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Lawan Shisu, said it occurred in the wee hours of yesterday. He explained that the suspected kidnappers stormed the family house of the senatorial candidate in Kiyawa town of Kiyawa Local Council and forcefully whisked the victim away. According to him, after receiving the news, the Commissioner of Police mobilised special police team for her rescue. To ensure the immediate arrest of the suspects and rescue of the victim, the police are collaborating with other security agencies and public for useful information, he added. A local source told The Guardian that about 20 armed kidnappers stormed the town in three vehicles and, after scaring the people away, entered the house of the victim and took her away. MEANWHILE, the abductors of the District Head of Panyam in Mangu Local Council of Plateau State, HRH Adamu Derwam, have come up with a demand for N150 million before their victim could be freed. Derwam was kidnapped on Monday morning from his residence. The kidnappers, according to the family, allowed the abducted traditional ruler to speak to his wife and some family members. However, a family source told The Guardian that they regarded the ransom as too high and urged the abductors to reduce it.
