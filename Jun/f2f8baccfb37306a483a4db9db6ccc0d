An Uyo High Court, yesterday, remanded a 32-year-old ‘prophet’, Godson Nse Thompson, in Uyo Correctional Centre, for alleged sexual assault on a 13-year-old girl, who was brought to him for intercessory prayers.
   
The trial judge, Justice Bassey Nkanang, ordered the remand of the alleged prophet, a native of Ikot Offiong Nsit in Nsit Ibom Local Council, after hearing the evidence of the victim, who is an Senior Secondary (SS) 1 student of a government secondary school in Uyo.
  
In her evidence, the victim, a native of Ikot Uboh in Nsit Ubium, told the court that, while living with her elder sister in Uyo, her in-law took her to a church at Information Drive, Uyo and when he left at about 6:00p.m, the pastor took her to his house, where she was sexually abused all through the night.
  
She said the accused person, a father of three children, gave her a bucket to urinate inside the house to prevent her from going outside.
  
The minor  narrated that on the fateful day, the alleged prophet told her that she should accompany him elsewhere to pray for somebody, which she did, only to end up in his house, where he brought black liquid substance in a plastic bottle and drank before raping her.
   
She said she saw ladies’ panties in different colours and pictures of women inside the house of the prophet.
   
The victim said she was able to escape when the accused person forgot to lock the door of the house and ran to a church where she was rescued. At the conclusion of the evidence of the victim, the trial judge adjourned the matter to August 1, 2022 for continuation of trial. The judge ordered the accused to be taken back to prison till the next  adjourned date.
