The Director-General of Voice of Nigeria (VON), Mr Osita Okechukwu, says that the just-concluded All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention has proved nay sayers wrong and those that thought that the party will implode. Okechukwu, a foundation member of APC, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Saturday that the party emerged stronger and united after the “very peaceful” convention held for two days in Abuja. He said that the recent move by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, APC presidential flag bearer to personally visit other aspirants that contested with him with the message of “APC won” is already bringing all members together. “The convention remains one of the best I have personally witnessed in my over 40 years of political career. “The presidential primary was peaceful, transparent and clean, devoid of ethno-religious and sectional sentiments. “APC did not implode as predicted by nay sayers and other people who had predicted that we would disintegrate at the end of the convention. “The convention had a marvelous and excellent outcome, as we hoisted the national unity flag in the presidential primary convention. “While our party’s presidential flag bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu won as a pan Nigerian candidate and not on sectional or ethno-religious inclinations,” he said. Okechukwu also commended Tinubu and every member of APC for a well deserved victory at the convention. “I must also commend northern governors and political stakeholders who insisted that the rotation convention between the north and south should be maintained in order to engender national unity,” he added.
