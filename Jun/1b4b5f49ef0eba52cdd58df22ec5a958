After a six-week legal tussle between the former Hollywood power couple, a US jury awarded Depp more than $10 million in damages, in contrast to just $2 million for Heard, who had counter-sued. During the trial, which was live-streamed to millions, the two traded claims of violent domestic abuse, and Heard was targeted by countless social media posts and internet memes throughout.
