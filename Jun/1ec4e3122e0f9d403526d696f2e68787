Manchester City will begin the defence of their Premier League title at West Ham while Liverpool travels to Fulham on the opening weekend of the season. The 2022/23 fixtures, published on Thursday, give new Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag an opening test at Old Trafford against Brighton, who hammered United 4-0 last month. Nottingham Forest’s first match in the top flight for 23 years will be at Newcastle. Pep Guardiola’s City will start their bid for a fifth title in six seasons at the London Stadium on Sunday, August 7, after all their rivals have begun their campaigns. Frank Lampard, whose Everton side narrowly escaped relegation, comes up against his former employers Chelsea on the previous evening. For the second season running Arsenal have the honour of kicking off the new campaign with a short trip to Crystal Palace on Friday, August 5. Liverpool and City renew their rivalry at Anfield in mid-October, after a midweek Champions League tie, with the return fixture scheduled for the start of April.
