Since her delete spree, Queen B has broken the internet, becoming a Twitter sensation. Many artists have removed their social media posts or even their pages to make major announcements since social media became the most popular communication method. A Twitter fan with the account @beyonceparkwood wrote, “The last time she did this was in 2016. In the space of just 48 hours, Beyoncé deleted her branding, released Formation and announced a fifth world tour. Be scared. It looks like we’re in for a wild weekend.” Beyoncé has the public’s attention. Her latest effort, however, is met with considerable scepticism and hopes. Some fans believe Beyoncé will unveil a new project rather than release music. Reacting to the deleted profile pictures, another fan wrote, “Beyonce deleted her profile pictures on every single platform she’s on … going to sleep scared and nervous to thing what i might wake up to.” It has been six years since 2016 the Bey Hive was given an album. Fans are hoping for a big announcement about her seventh studio album, despite the fact that the rest of her feed is still intact.
