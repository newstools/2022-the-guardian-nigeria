The show’s director, writer and executive producer, Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed its return in a letter to fans which reads “And now, Gi-hun returns.”   A post shared by Squid Game (@squidgamenetflix) “The Front Man returns. Season 2 is coming.” Dong-hyuk also teased new developments on the show, noting that the mysterious salesman who recruits desperate players to the game show would return. “The man in the suit with ddakji might be back.” The letter also said viewers will be introduced to Cheol-su, the “boyfriend” of the show’s infamous animatronic doll, Young-hee. Noting that the “Squid Game” deserved a second season following the global attention it received, the show’s creator wrote in his letter “It took 12 years to bring the first season of ‘Squid Game’ to life last year. But it took 12 days for ‘Squid Game’ to become the most popular Netflix series ever.” “As the writer, director, and producer of ‘Squid Game,’ a huge shout out to fans around the world. Thank you for watching and loving our show… Join us once more for a whole new round.” While Netflix is yet to confirm the exact date for the show’s release, many “Squid Game” fans have taken to social media to express their excitement for a second season. What to expect The deadly ‘Red Light Green Light’ game in Squid Game | Image: Netflix Back in May, Hwang Dong-hyuk hinted that the show’s second season may be even more dramatic than its first. The creator speaking to Variety, revealed that the second season of the famed Korean series would question whether humanity can conquer all as a united front. He said, “Humanity is going to be put to a test through those games once again.” He added, “I want to ask the question, ‘Is true solidarity between humans possible?'” Dong-hyuk also pointed out that the disconnect among players accounted for the many deaths in season one. “If they were capable of talking with one another, of co-operating with one another, I do agree that there could have been a possibility that we could have seen more winners,” he added.

The series is the first Korean drama to take the top spot on Netflix in the United States and has even spurred interest among people in learning Korean. Dong-hyuk has revealed that many of the show’s characters are drawn from his real life. In fact, The games were traditional children’s games, all of which Dong-hyuk played growing up in Seoul. Like show character Sang-woo, a troubled investment banker in the series, Dong-hyuk is also a graduate of South Korea’s elite Seoul National University (SNU) with financial problems despite his degree. Dong-hyuk, like Gi-hun, was raised by a widowed mother, and the low-income family lived in the kind of subterranean semi-basement housing.
