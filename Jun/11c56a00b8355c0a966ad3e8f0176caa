CKay has surpassed 3 billion career streams and recently sold out his first two shows in the United States. With love nwantiti breaking several records, including being the most streamed song globally on Spotify, and Emiliana once garnering over 700 thousand streams in a single day on Spotify, WATAWI is another opportunity for CKay to capture the ears and hearts of his fans around the world. Nigeria’s Afrobeats heavyweight, Davido, and South Africa’s Amapiano chief lyricist and artist, Focalistic, are both multi-platinum artists featured on this new hit with Abidoza on production. Abidoza adds his Midas touch with the beat, while Davido tunes in with his effortless flow. Focalistic spares 18 bars of Sipotori rap (a language which blends various languages, popular in the townships of Pretoria). CKay’s vocals and signature layered harmonies drive the song on a catchy sing along, which compliments the soulful Amapiano production. Lyrically, the song covers a common topic in modern relationships – WATAWI / what are we? CKay, Davido, and Focalistic narrate the situation through the smoothest of melodies, as they make it clear to their respective ladies that no labels are required for what they are. “A lot of people have been in tricky situations when their “situationship” attempts to push things further than it needs to be,” comments CKay on the story behind WATAWI. “Sometimes it’s best to let things be and just vibe without the pressure of defining the nature of the relationship.”
