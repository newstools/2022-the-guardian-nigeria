• It is a farce, police react It was a case of breaching procedural rules guiding rule of law in the country, as a power-drunk senior police officer in charge of Area D Command headquarters in Mushin, Lagos State, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Aliko Dankoli, allegedly ordered locking up of a Lagos Magistrate. CP Abiodun Alabi  It was not certain if the matter had been resolved between the Police and the Lagos State Judiciary, which actually sent the Magistrate for routine duty at the Command.  MEANWHILE, the Police Public Relations Officer, Superintendent of Police (SP), Benjamin Hundeyin, said the story is nothing, but fiction. He said at no time did the Area Commander detain or attempted to detain the Magistrate. He said the police would never engage in such disrespect to the judiciary. “The Lagos State Police Command did the needful and contacted the judiciary. The Lagos State Judiciary confirmed that there was no such thing and neither was the Magistrate prevented from carrying out her cell inspection exercise. We hereby state unequivocally that any attempt to cause disaffection between the police and the judiciary will be fiercely resisted. We remain worthy partners in the justice sector. “The Command enjoins Lagosians to disregard the story as officers and men under the stewardship of CP Abiodun Alabi, will continue to be professionals and uphold the rule of law at all times.”
