A former Deputy Governor of Ekiti State, Prof Olusola Eleka, has hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies deployed for the governorship election in the state for their consistency and fairness. Eleka, who voted yesterday at Unit 7, Ward 2 Okeruku, Ikere Ekiti, noted that the governorship election was fair, transparent and orderly, declaring that the people would wait till the votes were concluded. It will be recalled that Prof. Eleka was the Deputy Governor to former Governor Ayodele Fayose who rules from 2014 to 2018, and was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the 2018 poll, lost to incumbent APC and Kayode Fayemi-led administration. He lauded the electorate for conducting themselves in an orderly manner, declaring that the PDP would win the election. He said he had voted for his party but the outcome would be the wish of the people. “I have done my part, I’ve voted for my party, water the outcome is the wish of the people. I think there was a place where they complained of rubber stamp and the people insisted that stamp must be provided before they will continue with the process,” Eleka said. “In my ward alone, we have seven security personnel, apart from the other security personnel that are patrolling. I think that that is a wise and good arrangement. “The process itself is quite fair and I think it will make the process count. Usually, you will expect the people to wait behind to defend their votes. Even if you don’t tell them to wait, they will want to wait so that the votes are counted correctly.”
