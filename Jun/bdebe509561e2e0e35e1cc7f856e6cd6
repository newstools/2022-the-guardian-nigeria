The Movement for the Actualisation of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has taken a swipe at the former deputy Senate President, Ike Ekwerenmadu, and a former Governor of old Anambra State, Chief Jim Nwobodo, over their recent comments regarded as antithetical to political aspirations of the Southeast geo-political zone, especially against Peter Obi’s presidential candidature. In a statement, yesterday, by the group’s National Secretary, Ugwuoke Ibem Ugwuoke, MASSOB viewed the comments as coming out from those considered as “political slaves to the Hausa and Fulani northern oligarchy.” The separatist group held that the duo were not the spokespersons of the Southeast. The statement said: “Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State Of Biafra (MASSOB) condemns the unguarded and provocative utterances by Senator Ike Ekweremadu and Jim Nwobodo against former governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi, that Ndigbo will never vote for him. We viewed their statements as that of political slaves to Hausa Fulani of Northern oligarchy. “It’s very unfortunate that learned men Ike Ekweremadu and Jim Nwobodo will be used against their own people to say that South East will not vote for Mr. Peter Obi. Who even made them the spokespersons for Ndigbo?”                             
The group said the two should desist from such. “MASSOB wish to warn all Igbo politicians that our non violence nature should not be taken for granted, it is time all Igbo political betrayals in Igbo land will be paid back in their own coins. “Ike Ekweremadu has been in government for over twenty years, yet still not satisfied. MASSOB will not allow greedy politicians in Igbo land to destroy the future of our next generation because of their selfish desires. MASSOB will mobilise Igbo youths, market women/men, town unions and students to vote against bad leadership in the entire Igbo land,” the statement insisted.
