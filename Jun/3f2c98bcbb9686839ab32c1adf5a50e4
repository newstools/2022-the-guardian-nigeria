A NON-GOVERNMENTAL Organisation (NGO), Loveled Foundation, in partnership with the Nigerian Girls Guild Association and others, has urged government to encourage local production of sanitary products and ensure free distribution to girls in rural communities as it does with the male folk on contraceptives.  He noted that poor menstrual hygiene could pose serious health risks like reproductive and urinary tract infections that can result in infertility and birth complications.
 
Ewuziem said inadequate sanitary facilities, lack of access to affordable and quality menstrual hygiene products, as well as stigma and social norms associated with menstruation, contributed to poor hygiene.
   
He stated that driven by the need to address the situation, especially with the price of sanitary pads up to 500 per cent, the foundation and its partners distributed free menstrual hygiene kits to teenage girls in the community and also equipped them with information and knowledge on how to make reusable sanitary pads for themselves. Youth Co-ordinator of the association, Lagos State chapter, Adebayo Taiwo Ayomide, observed that menstrual hygiene practice in the country was poor, hence the call for more sustainable solutions.  Iyanuoluwa said poverty had limited many young girls from assessing healthy menstrual products, hence the reusable sanitary pads are being taken to the community. A mother, Mariam Agunbiade, commended the foundation for the initiative, stating that it would assist families that could not afford sanitary pads for their teenagers.
