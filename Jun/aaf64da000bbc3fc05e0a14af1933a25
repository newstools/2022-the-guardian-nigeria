This would be the rapper’s first headline show in almost a year. Scott will headline the “D N Vegas” concert alongside other headliners Sza and J. Cole. Other artists slated to perform at the concert include Playboi Carti, 21 Savage, Baby Keem, Summer Walker, H.E.R., Jhene Aiko, Trippie Redd, Jorja Smith, Pusha T, Joji, Aminé, City Girls, T-Pain, Vince Staples, Freddie Gibbs, Steve Lacy, Tems, Syd, Sabrina Claudio, and more. The hip-hop festival is scheduled for September 2nd-4th. Last year, Scott was to headline the 2021 “Day N Vegas” concert a week after his Astroworld festival; however, his performance was canceled following the tragedy. According to the most recent assessment by the attorneys representing victims, over 4,900 individuals were hurt at Astroworld. On May 10, a court complaint cited a total of 4,932 claimed victims. In addition to the ten persons who died, the latest complaint claims that 732 people needed “intensive medical therapy” and 1,649 others needed less extensive care. Another 2,540 people were classified as “other,” indicating that the severity of their injuries was still being determined.
