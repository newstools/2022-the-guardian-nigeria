TMZ reports that the “Wild ‘n’ Out” host is expecting another child with the same woman he had twins with one year ago. Announcing her pregnancy, Abby shared a photograph of herself in front of a balloon that reads “BABY”. She captioned the photo, “IM PREGNANT  Another set of twins?!”   A post shared by Abby De La Rosa (@hiabbydelarosa) In June 2021, Nick Cannon and Abby welcomed twin boys Zillion and Zion. In the same month, Nick welcomed his son Zen with model Alyssa Scott, who unfortunately passed away from a brain tumor five months after his birth. Earlier this year, Nick Cannon had a gender reveal with Bre Tiesi, announcing that they were expecting a baby boy, Nick’s eighth child. Why so many babies? Speaking on the podcast “Lip Service” on Youtube, Nick revealed that he had a love addiction. He said, “My therapist told me I needed to chill out. So I was like, let’s try celibacy. That was October. I didn’t even make it to January. I was supposed to make it to the top of year but obviously I started going through some things.” “I got depressed with the loss of my son. So in December…everybody saw I was so down, so everybody was like, ‘Let me just give him a little vagina, that’s going to cure it all!’ And I fell victim to it because I was in a weak state. So December especially, right before Christmas, I started f-king like crazy.” How many now? Nick has two kids with ex-wife Mariah Carey, 10-year-old twins Monroe and Moroccan. He also shares a 4-year-old son Golden “Sagon,” and a 1-year-old daughter, Powerful Queen, with ex Brittany Bell.
