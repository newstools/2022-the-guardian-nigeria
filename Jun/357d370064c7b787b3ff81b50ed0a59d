Bunza described Wamakko as a ”champion of education in the North-West who should be emulated by other privileged individuals. In a paper he presented on: ”The Importance of education in the society,” the university don said: ”It is heart warming that the lawmaker had so far sponsored thousands of indigent youths to study in various universities within and outside Nigeria. ”Giving knowledge in the society will certainly reduce crimes and criminality such as banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and youth restiveness. ”Wamakko is a leader per excellence, especially with regards to his philanthropic works by impacting positively in the lives of the common man”. The Chairman of the occasion, a retired Permanent Secretary, Alhaji Aminu Dodo-Iya, extolled the giant strides of Wamakko in the area of human development, urging other elected officials to emulate him for a better Nigeria.
