Benin Traditional Council (BTC), yesterday, flayed withdrawal of criminal charges by Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, against a citizen, Arisco Rich Osemwingie, who claimed the Ogiamien chieftaincy title of the kingdom. Addressing newsmen in Benin City, the Benin palace chiefs, led by the Iyase of Benin, Chief Sam Igbe, said: “The Benis, both at home and abroad,  have been very angry over the withdrawal of the criminal case against the said Rich Arisco Osemwingie and one other.” Igbe who frowned on the withdrawal of the case by the Edo State Government via a publication from the office of the Edo State Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, said: “We want to hereby state categorically that the said Mr. Rich Arisco Osemwingie is not Ogiamien. He has no locus standi to claim or be addressed as Ogiamien neither has he any right to the title of Ogiamien of Benin Kingdom. We are told that his relationship with the Ogiamien family is maternal and not paternal, hence he has no right to, or say, in the Ogiamien chieftaincy title,” Igbe said. The chiefs noted that there was no proper consultation with the Oba of Benin palace before the withdrawal of the criminal case. The Iyase of Benin further stated that Chief Osarobo Ogiamien is the existing Ogiamien of Benin Kingdom, stressing that the family of Ogiamien has not informed the palace of his demise.
