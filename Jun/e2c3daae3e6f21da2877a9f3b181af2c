Governorship aspirant in 2019 and former House of Representatives member under All Progressives Congress (APC), Ahmed Wadada, has defected to the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Aggrieved Wadada, who alleged injustice in Nasarawa APC, had earlier announced his resignation from the party.
Wadada said he was forced to dump the APC following controversy that trailed the recent Nasarawa West Senatorial District primary election. Speaking at a rally organised for his defection, yesterday, in Keffi Local Council, the former lawmaker told his supporters his intention to contest the Nasarawa West Senate seat in the 2023 general elections. “The kind of projects I have for my people are the same kind of projects I carried out for them when I was a member of the House of Representatives, which is why they are all in support of me. “I have added value to human capacity. I represented them well in the past and helped bring civilisation to the people,” he said. Wadada defected alongside Jonathan Gaza, a serving Rep for Karu/Keffi/Kokona Federal Constituency.
