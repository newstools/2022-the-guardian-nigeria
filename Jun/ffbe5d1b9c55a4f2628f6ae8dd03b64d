Eleven out of the 61 persons kidnapped following the March 28 Abuja-Kaduna train attack have regained their freedom. While the circumstance of their release remains sketchy, it was gathered that the 11 victims have been flown to the nation’s capital, Abuja. It would be recalled that news had made the round during that some of the abducted were released, but was quickly debunked by their family members. Among those who regained their freedom are six females and five males. The attack, which occurred on March 28 at Dutse forest in Chikun local council, left eight people dead and 26 others injured while scores of passengers went missing. Among the first set of persons released earlier after the kidnap was the Managing Director of the Nigerian Bank of Agriculture, Alwan Hassan whom the bandits claimed was freed due to his old age.
