Plateau State has recorded two cases of the dreaded monkey pox disease; an outbreak that has become a global concern. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nimkong Lar, told journalists in Jos that the two cases were recorded in Shendam and Bassa local councils. Lar further disclosed that the patient from Shendam was treated and discharged, while that Bassa was responding to treatment. According to him, the ministry has embarked on health education to sensitise the populace on the disease. “The sensitisation is on the importance of imbibing the culture of hand washing and maintaining good hygiene to contain the disease,” he said, cautioning health workers to ensure they use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in the treatment of infected persons to avoid the spread of the disease. “The disease is primarily transmitted from animal to man, while the secondary source of transmission is through human to human. I call on the citizens to report any sign of unexplained rashes to the nearest health facility,” Lar added. He urged the public to drink potable water, wash fruits and vegetables properly as well as shun open defecation to avoid the spread of gastrointestinal diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea.
