Lady Captain of Dolphin Golf Club, Navy Town, Ojoo, Lagos, Onwuegbu Bose Ngozi, was the star performer at the 2022 International Women’s Day golf tournament, returning with 35 nett to also win the longest drive prize in the nine-hole tournament. The competition was aimed at celebrating women for their contributions to humanity and according to Onwuegbu, lady golfers, women, girls all over the world set aside the day to play golf at the same time globally. “It’s a three to four hours tournament, so we joined the rest of the world to celebrate it. It is the first of its kind in Dolphin Golf Club, as we have men and professionals also playing along with us. “Women are pillars of the society. We want to add value to society, while pushing for membership and ensuring people are healthy.
 
“Trophies were presented and gifts for all attendees, whether you played or not, won or didn’t win, including the caddies, caterers, staff, cleaner, bar boys, kitchen staff and everyone had the gifts,” said Onwuegbu. She added that most other sportsmen retire into playing golf, which, she said, is a lifetime sport. “In golf, there is no old age. You have been hearing of Tiger Woods for a long time, he is still there, but several footballers have retired,” she said.
