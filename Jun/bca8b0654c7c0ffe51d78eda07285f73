Former deputy president of the Nigerian Senate, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu, will remain in custody until his next court date. The senator, on Thursday, appeared in court in London for a second time on charges of arranging to bring a minor to the UK for organ donation. The 60-year-old Ekweremadu, according to report by the BBC, stood in the dock at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court wearing a grey tracksuit and holding a bible. The report stated that no bail application was made and Ekweremadu will remain in custody until his next appearance at Westminster Magistrates’ court on July 7. The report further added that because part of the alleged offence was committed outside of the United Kingdom, the consent of the attorney general is required for the case to continue. Ekweremadu faces a charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of another person for exploitation under the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015. His wife Beatrice is charged with arranging or facilitating the travel of another person for exploitation. Beatrice, 55, according to the report will appear in court later due to a delay in her transport from prison. Earlier this week the Nigerian Immigration Authority denied the victim, David Ukpo, was a child, with the agency’s comptroller general, Idriss Jerre, saying the victim’s birth certificate and National Identity Number, which were presented during registration for his passport, showed that he was 21 years old. In response the Metropolitan Police said Ukpo was 15.
