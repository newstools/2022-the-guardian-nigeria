Nigeria is West Africa’s largest recipient of Foreign direct investment (FDI) as its flow doubled to $4.8 billion in 2021, mainly because of a resurgence in investments in the oil and gas sectors.  In terms of subregions, Southern Africa, East Africa and West Africa saw their investment flows rise while those to Central Africa remained flat and North Africa registered a decline.
 
The largest holders of foreign assets in Africa remained European, led by investors in the United Kingdom ($65 billion) and France ($60 billion). In West Africa, the FDI increased by 48 per cent to $14 billion. While projects in extractive industries helped push FDI to Ghana up to $2.6 billion – an increase of 39 per cent compared with 2020, Senegal also saw a notable 21 per cent increase in FDI, which reached $2.2 billion.
