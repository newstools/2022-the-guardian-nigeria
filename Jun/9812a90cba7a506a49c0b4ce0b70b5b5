Nigerian artiste, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy will face police questioning for the second time in six years.  In November 2017, the artist was invited by Lagos State Police Command over alleged robbery investigation.
   
Lagos State Police Commissioner’s Special Squad has detained five policemen attached to the singer for attempted murder following the shooting of fun seekers at the Lagos club.  So the level of involvement of everyone in the incident will determine his punishment or otherwise. We should not preempt what the report will reveal.”
