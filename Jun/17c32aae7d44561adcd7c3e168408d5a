The Secretary-General expresses his deep condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the people of Mali. He condemns these attacks in the strongest terms and calls on the Malian authorities to swiftly investigate them and bring the perpetrators to justice. The Secretary-General calls on the Malian authorities to redouble their efforts to restore peace and stability to Mali, and reiterates the readiness of the United Nations and its Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) to support these efforts.
