The pioneer National Chairman and founder of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), Dr. Boniface Aniebonam, has declared that Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso remains the sole presidential aspirant of the party and would fly its flag in the 2023 general election. Aniebonam made the disclosure in Lagos, yesterday, while speaking with journalists, saying the party would confirm Kwankwaso as its presidential candidate at its Special National Convention scheduled for June 8 in Abuja. He said the Kano State-born politician has the divine voice of God to lead Nigeria on the platform of NNPP, noting that the responsibility before Kwankwaso was to reunite Nigerians and address insecurity through a revamped economy, employment opportunities and social services. Aniebonam said: “It is time for God’s intervention in Nigeria. What Nigeria need now is a strong leader like Kwankwaso, a man with character and patriotism, with capacity for human development. “When we get a strong leader, all agitations will die a natural death. If Kwankwaso emerges the president, some of these problems will be resolved.” He noted Nigeria’s numerous challenges could only be solve by divine leadership, adding that Kwankwaso is a man of God. “Let Nigeria start again from the beginning. Kwankwaso is coming in to bring everybody together to end all these challenges. He is going to bring Nigerians together and he is going to re-unite this country,” he added. He charged Nigerians to take responsibility and elect credible Nigerians in 2023 to enthrone good governance. “Indeed, the problem of Nigeria is so solvable if only leadership in divine. This is because there are no difficulties in bringing all the nationalities together to discuss how best we can live together as a people. The resources are available to cater for social amenities, sports, youths development and education,” he said.
