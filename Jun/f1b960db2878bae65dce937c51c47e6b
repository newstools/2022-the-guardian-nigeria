 Shape Magazine Skin-Care-Products-For-Dry-Melanated-Skin A person’s confidence comes from many things. The way they talk, the way they smell, the way they dress, the way they carry themselves, and the icing on the cake, the  way their skin glows. While skincare has been around for a long time, the buzz around skincare has become more heightened recently. In fact, skincare is no longer just linked to feminity as most people, male or female, now  see the need to care for their skin. Your skin is a part of you. And just as you can’t go out wearing dirty and rumpled looking clothes, so should your skin receive the much needed extra care. There are a list of things that one shouldn’t do or completely stay away from when it comes to skincare. Remember your skin is very sensitive. I might liken it to a baby.  Now let’s get into it. The first thing on our list: Stay away from whitening products If we’re being honest, your skin already looks great, all it needs is a little care to bring out its shine. But what you don’t need for this are whitening products, which would no doubt affect your skin in the long run. For one, these products can cause colouration of your skin. Imagine walking around looking like something a rainbow threw up. Exactly! Not a good picture. Over-exfoliating While exfoliating is great for maintaining your skin’s health, over exfoliating isn’t. Think of it this way, imagine constantly scrubbing at a particular spot on a cloth. What happens to the spot? It becomes worn out. Your skin is just like that. over-exfoliating can cause tears in your skin. Tiny little tears that you can’t see but trust me, you can definitely feel. Scalding hot water Raise your hands if you use hot water every morning and by hot, we mean scalding hot water. The sensation might be great but it is doing a number on your skin. What scalding hot water does is strip your skin of its essential oils, leaving it bare and prone to damage. Yes, you can still bathe with hot water. But not the kind that will give hell a run for its money. Go for tepid instead. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1788928 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine-.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine-.jpg 1440w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everyday-Health-how-to-build-a-smart-skin-care-routine--600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Not drinking water We’ve all said, “I keep drinking but all I get is pee. My skin really doesn’t care.” But water is an important aspect on your skincare journey. When you are thirsty, you drink water. The skin also needs water but unlike you who can walk to the fridge and get water for yourself, the skin can not detach itself to get water. It depends on you. In order to save yourself from dry skin that is caused by dehydration, Drink Water. Less dryness, less wrinkles. Think about it. Sleeping  without washing your face This task can be stressful. Imagine having a very tiring day and all you want to do is spread out on your bed and drift to wonderland but then you remember that you haven’t washed your face. The urge to cry will definitely come. But even in your tired state, you must. The buildup of dirt and sweat from the entire day can clog up your pores. And you know what that means: You would end up waking up the next day with a fresh batch of acne. Makeup Some people are blessed with skins that don’t break out while some are not as fortunate. Know the type of skin you have and work with it. There are light coverage makeups and full coverage. There are also makeup products that are made with natural ingredients that help in protecting your skin; be it locking in the moisture or preventing redness of the face. Most importantly, wash your face extremely well after use of make up. Sleeping on a dirty pillowcase You wash your face, do all the necessary treatment and go to bed. The next morning you wake up with breakouts wondering how it happened. It’s your pillow. It’s like using a dirty rag to wipe a clean surface. The dirt is most definitely going to transfer to that clean surface.Using unnecessary products Having 12 moisturiser and using all of them is harmful to your skin. These products are good but that doesn’t mean you should proceed to load everything on your skin. Remember your skin is like a baby. When a baby doesn’t like something, it will react. Same with your skin. Once your skin doesn’t agree with the load of skin products you are using, it will react and you may not like the result.
