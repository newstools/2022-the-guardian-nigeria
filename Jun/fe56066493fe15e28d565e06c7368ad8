Political leaders in Abraka, Ethiope East Local Government Area of Delta state has condemned alleged vilification of the state Governor, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa by one of it’s kinsmen, a former lawmaker in the state, Evance Ochuko lvwurie. The community leaders in a statement on Thursday morning in Abuja, jointly signed by Dr. Kings Okpako, Chief Professor Andrew Ekakitie, Anthony Ajaino and Anthony Edafiogho said they were constrained to write in defence of the community because the actions are entirely his own and not a representation of the mood of the community. They called on Ivwurie to desist from any manner of calumnious campaign and enjoined the general public to disregard all his write-ups and note the stand of the Abraka people. “We wholeheartedly condemn the reckless vituperation on the state Governor by one of our kinsman, Evance Ochuko Ivwurie,” they said. “The governor does not deserve it at al. The actions are entirely his own and not a representation of the mood of the community. “Abraka people are not known to be that foully loquacious. We thereby dissociate ourselves from his malefaction. “Governor Okowa has been nice to Abraka Community and its people since he became governor of Delta State. “Governor Okowa, to the best of our knowledge, has assisted him so much that it is satanic to attribute the political woes of this our kinsman, on the innocent governor. He must realize that his electoral value is near zero even in his own unit. “Governor Okowa is eminently qualified to hold the position of the Vice president of the Federal republic of Nigeria if our great Party, the PDP so deemed it fit. Therefore we are solidly behind the governor in his quest. “We hereby admonish our fellow kinsmen to desist from any manner of calumnious campaign. “We therefore enjoined the general public to disregard all his write ups and please note the stand of the Abraka people.”
