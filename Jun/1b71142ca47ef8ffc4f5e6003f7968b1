The European Union (EU) has urged youths to strengthen the nation’s democracy by actively participating in the electoral process. Head of the EU Delegation to Nigeria, Samuela Isopi, who made the appeal at the weekend during the Youth Vote Count Mega Music Concert at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) in Lagos, decried low voter turnout by young Nigerians, urging reorientation. She commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on innovations and technology in the Electoral Acts, noting that they would make elections credible, transparent and protect votes. Her words: “We need to change the stance and mobilise the youth, which is why we are here to mobilise you because you are a massive force.  You have the power to make change happen, and make a difference. Don’t give up your power, your vote is your power,  get it and use it. “Come out to register, pick up your card and on Election Day, cast your votes because your votes will count.” INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, assured youths that their votes would count in next year’s general elections. He charged the young Nigerians to pick up their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and exercise their franchise. Yakubu expressed satisfaction with the population of youths coming out to be captured in the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR).
