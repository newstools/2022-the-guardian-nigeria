Nigeria’s electricity grid operated by the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has again collapsed. The development, which has been reoccurring in recent times, occurred around 7:00p.m. yesterday. Recall that the grid has collapsed about 10 times this year as electricity generation remained at about 2,000 megawatts for the past three months. Many of the Distribution Companies (DisCos), which confirmed the development to The Guardian last night, said the system, operated from Osogbo in Osun State shutdown around 6.49p.m. Head, Corporate Communications at Enugu DisCo, Emeka Ezeh, said all the company’s outgoing feeders were down, affecting supply to customers in Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Enugu and Imo states. “We are on standby, awaiting further information on restoration of supply from the National Control Centre (NCC),” he said. Head, Corporate Communication at Kaduna DisCo, Abdulazeez Abdullahi, in a note to consumers, decried the development, stressing that the power outage being experienced across the company’s franchise states was due to system collapse of the national grid. “The collapse occurred at 18:47p.m. hence the loss of supply on all our outgoing feeders. Power supply shall be restored as soon as the national grid is powered back,” he noted. Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) also in a note to customers, blamed the blackout on the development, calling for understanding “as all stakeholders are working hard to restore normal supply.” Since electricity sector was privatised in 2013, Nigeria’s Osogbo-based national grid has failed electricity consumers more than 130 times.
