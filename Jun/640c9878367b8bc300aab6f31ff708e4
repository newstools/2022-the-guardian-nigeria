(Photo by J. Countess/WireImage) Idris Elba apparently wants to make an offer of $1 billion GBP ($1.2 billion USD), which would be used to buy the UK broadcast service Channel 4. The CEO and founder of the marketing and communications group The Miroma Group, Marc Boyan, is reportedly in conversation with the actor about the bid. Variety also reports that Channel 4 refused to respond, and as of this writing, Elba’s team has not issued a remark. Channel 4 will be sold, UK Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries revealed in April 2022, in an effort to compete with major worldwide streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. According to a prior statement by the British lawmaker, the sale plans “will revamp decades-old laws to help our public service broadcasters compete in the internet age and usher in a new golden age for British TV and radio.”
