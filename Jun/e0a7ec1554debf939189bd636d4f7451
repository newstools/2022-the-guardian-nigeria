Nigeria’s women cricket national team coach, Leke Oyede, has said his goal is to win enough match to climb a new height on the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) ranking with the team at the Kwibuka tournament. Oyede said though the team has had setbacks in the number of players that withdrew from the squad to write exams, he is assured of result at the event holding in Kigali, Rwanda. “I am very encouraged at the way the team is responding to training and we are not perturbed that some few players that featured at the Women T20 in Lagos didn’t make it. We have quality replacements and we have all been together for close to a month. We are counting on the teamwork, fitness, strategy and the chemistry we have built during the period we were in camp.” He said, he reckoned the Nigeria Women are only ranked above Botswana at the event, but with the spirit in the team and amount of works done, he expects to return from the event with enough win that will lift Nigeria’s ranking from the 37th place it presently occupies. “Our collective goal is to win matches, especially against teams above us, so we can move up and attain for the country a new height in ranking,” he added. He said his technical crew has all the data of the teams in the competition and are ready to apply themselves to the discipline that will keep them focused and win the games.
