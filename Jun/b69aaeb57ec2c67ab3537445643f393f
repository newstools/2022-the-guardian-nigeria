The Minister of Power, Engr. Abubakar Aliyu has stated that the power supply will soon be restored to Maiduguri, Borno State.  He directed that the Rural Electrification Agency explore ways through which the State universities will benefit from the energising education policy of the Federal Government. 
 
Vice-Chancellor, Borno State University, Prof. Umar Kyari Sandabe appreciated the minister for his efforts at reforming the power sector. He said the institution has been out of power supply since 2020 due to the insurgency. 
   
He said the university has been on generators, which takes a huge sum of its funding, adding that the generators, despite consuming a huge sum of their funds do not provide adequate electric power for the university operations. He craved the indulgence of the minister to ensure that the power supply is restored to the university, promising that the institution will secure all power projects within its premises.
