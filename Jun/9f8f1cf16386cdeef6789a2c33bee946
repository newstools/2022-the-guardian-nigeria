On Instagram, Ingram shared several examples of racist messages and remarks, claiming to have received hundreds of them, some of which featured the N-word. Via their Twitter handle, they tweeted that it was “proud to welcome” Ingram, who recently made her Disney+ series debut as Reva”Obi-Wan Kenobi.” The tweet further read “If anyone intends to make her feel in any way unwelcome, we have only one thing to say: we resist,” the “Star Wars” account tweeted. “There are more than 20 million sentient species in the Star Wars galaxy, don’t choose to be a racist.” Another co-star McGregor who voiced his thought on the issue said in a video “It just sickened me to my stomach to hear that this had been happening. We stand with Moses, we love Moses.” To emphasise his stance, the actor told fans “If you’re sending her bullying messages, you’re no ‘Star Wars’ fan in my mind.” He also praised her acting skills, describing Ingram as “a brilliant actor.” The actress shared on her Instagram stories where she said “There’s nothing anybody can do about this. There’s nothing anybody can do to stop this hate.” she said, in a video posted to her Instagram stories. The thing that bothers me is … this feeling of like, I just gotta shut up and take it, I just have to grin and bear it. And I’m not built like that,” she continued. “Thank you to the people who show up for me in the comments and in the places that I’m not going to put myself. And to the rest of y’all, y’all weird.” Other black actors among the cast of Star Wars like John Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran have also opened up about the racist hate they got when they appeared in the “Star Wars” films.
