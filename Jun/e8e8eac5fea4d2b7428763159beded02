• No policy to arrest, harass registered motorcycles at night, say police This is definitely not the best of times for commercial motorcyclists, popularly known as Okada riders, operating in satellite communities in Ogun State, following reports of harassment and extortion by men of the state Police Command.  “So, many of us operate at night to make up because customers are ready to pay any amount to get to their destinations at night.
 
“There is no other means of transportation at these satellite towns and many residents live about 10 kilometres from the expressway and have to get home.”
 
Confirming the situation, Matthew Edwin, whose house is in Toloto, one of the communities in the hinter land, said he normally leaves his office at the Island by 5:00p.m. only to get to Lotto Bus Stop  by 10:00p.m. or 10:30p.m  because of traffic.  He stressed that there was no policy in Ogun State that allows policeman to extort or harass any Okada rider at night in the area.
   
According to him, the police only gave a directive that every Okada rider must be registered and they must have a valid plate number, because anybody riding an unregistered motorcycle will have his motorcycle impounded.
     
He said: “We don’t have any policy that stops Okada riders from operating after 10:00p.m. Maybe what caused the harassment could be the recent cult clashes we are having in Mowe. “Those who came to unleash that terror, always came with Okada, maybe that is why they imposed that decision, at least for now, but that is not an excuse to harass and extort innocent riders. “We will investigate this as we have not received such complaints, but we don’t have any policy that stops Okada riders from operating after 10:00p.m.”
