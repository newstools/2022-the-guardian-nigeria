Idowu Sanusi and his friend, Yusuf Olatunji, set out on a Sunday evening before their car broke down along Itori, Ewekoro area of Ogun State. While making effort to tow the car some men in ‘military’ uniform appeared.  “In fact, I thought they were officers of Operation MESA, a joint Internal Security Operational platform made up of the Army, the Navy and the Air force, until they started collecting our phones, behaving roughly.”
      
According to him, his friend, Mustapha escaped immediately after he sighted them approaching them, but Idowu’s attempts to escape failed as he was brought down forcefully.
  
Sanusi said one of them quietly informed him that they were kidnappers and he would not hesitate to kill him if he tried to escape again.  “He said that they never introduced themselves to him as Muslims. He said that business and religion do not mix. We had to beg him. While in the bush a motorcycle rider brought food, drinks and drugs to the place that looked like an abandoned farm, as the whole place was deserted.
  
“They asked us to eat, we said no, but requested for water and they gave us. We were asked to call three lines each and request N50 million each totaling N100 million within 24 hours of our lives will be terminated.
 
“They later agreed to collect N10 million after begging and appeals. They gave their rules saying if we like we can inform the police or vigilante.” They asked us if we have seen their type of guns before, boasting that no police can face them.”
    
Sanusi and Yusuff were freed on Monday evening after spending 24 hours in the kidnappers’ den. They said they reported the case at Itori Police station, but nothing came out of it.
