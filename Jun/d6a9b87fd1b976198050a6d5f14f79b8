Two senators have defected from All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to other political parties. Senator Dauda Jika representing Bauchi Central withdrew his membership of APC to join New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) while Senator Ezenwa Francis Onyewuchi representing Imo East dumped PDP for Labour Party (LP). Ezrel Tabiowo, a media aide to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, announced their defections in a statement. Senator Jika said his decision to resign from the ruling party was because NNPP ideologies are in line with his aspirations. “I hereby wish to notify you of my defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) whose ideals are in line with my political aspirations,” Jika said. Meanwhile, Senator Onyewuchi said his decision to leave PDP for Labour Party was made after consultations with his constituents.
