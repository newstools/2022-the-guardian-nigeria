She made this revelation known in a post on her Instagram on Tuesday, June 26, alleging instances of violence. She wrote, “LEAVE NOW ALIVE OR LEAVE AS A CORPSE Many have died pretending all is well whilst wishing, hoping and praying for a better tomorrow. I don’t want to “die” or go inexplicably “missing”. I sincerely and publicly apologize for living a lie these past years. True to random speculations, there has been trouble in my “perceived paradise.”   A post shared by ChaCha (@chachaekefaani) “For the 2nd time in 2 years, I am here again on social media boldly declaring that I am done with my marriage. My long overdue/relentless stance on this is of course no news to Austin Faani, the doctors and my parents.” The actress hinted that he life might be at risk, pointing out the severity of the situation “If push comes to shove & suddenly I am incommunicado; my lawyers, the welfare department and the Nigerian police force have my testimonials in recorded video clips/statements set for public release on all social media apps and national newspapers,” she added. This is the second time she has publicly announced her separation from her husband. In 2020, she released a video informing the public of their split.   A post shared by Lindaikejiblog (@lindaikejiblogofficial) “You will say I am crazy, but I am not. This video is to let the world know that I am done with the marriage. I don’t have a lot to prove that I am done with him but I am done. I’m done. I am leaving with my life finally. I can’t say a lot now. You will hear my story,” she said. However, a few days later, she dismissed these claims, stating that she was bipolar. ”Five days ago I made a video saying that my marriage to Austin Faani is over and that video game with a lot of backlash from people with many insinuating that it is a clear case of domestic violence,” she said. “It is not. Austin has never laid his hands on me. He has never even raised his voice at me and God in heaven knows that’s the truth.” “Several psychiatrists have come to assess me mentally and I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Bipolar is real. Here in Africa, we tend to not know about it due to ignore or overlook it. I cannot tell you all how I have been feeling in these tiny videos I have been making but I will however show you in motion pictures soon.” Chacha Eke and Austin Faani first met at a Nollywood Talent show hunt back in 2007; it was not until 2009 that they met again and fell in love. The couple got married om 2013 and have four children together.
