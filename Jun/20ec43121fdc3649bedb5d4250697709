The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has extended the deadline for Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in Anambra State.  Nkwachukwu also threw light on the upsurge in the number of citizens seeking to register, which put pressure on the resources and capacity of INEC. He said: “It has also led to long queue, time and other inconveniences on the part of the prospective registrants.”  He appealed to prospective registrants to exercise patience and understanding, stressing that, contrary to reports, in several channels, the exercise would continue till June 30, this year. The REC pointed out that “INEC is addressing these challenges” through creation of additional registration centres in the state and local councils as well as re-opening of some Area offices that were shut as a result of insecurity.
