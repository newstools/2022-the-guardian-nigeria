The inaugural night, hosted by Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, featured the introduction of the reunion show and the former housemates. The former BBNaija Shine Ya Eye housemates brought their best to the first night of the reunion. With his black and gold attire, Emmanuel stood out, especially with his gold-laced stylish nose mask. Peace, with her ball gown and blond hair, looked like a fairytale queen, and the rest of the ex-housemates arrived in style as well. On the red carpet, the ex-housemates were interviewed by media personality, Miz Vick. They all shared their experiences from the show and how the show had changed their lives. Yerins noted that the fans were wild, adding that they fans also contributed to the overwhelming effect of the show. Niyi was not present for the inaugural show, according to Ebuka, since he was recovering from a medical condition. Niyi’s presence would have been greatly appreciated, according to the presenter, but he didn’t remain long on the show. Boma responded that the purpose would be exposed as the show went when asked what it was. Because of his closeness with Tega Dominic, the show’s sole married woman, Boma generated a lot of controversy during the show. Ebuka addressed the uproar surrounding Michael’s departure from the show. Michael was in a ship with Jackie B while on the show, and Whitemoney stepped in to take his place shortly after his six-week stay. “I wasn’t surprised,” Michael stated in response. He Whitemoney, has a terrific sense of style. It was entertaining to watch. “I feel everything worked out as it should have.” Whitemoney’s move did not offend Michael, he noted. Ex-housemates spilt the ‘tea’ and entertained fans throughout the reunion, which began on a joyful note on Thursday.
