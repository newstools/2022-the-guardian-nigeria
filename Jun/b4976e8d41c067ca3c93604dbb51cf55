The Adamawa State All Progressives Congress (APC) chapter has threatened to sue the Speaker of the House of Assembly Mr. Iya Abbas for not declaring vacant the seats of two members, Musa Umar (Mubi-north) and Shuaibu Musa (Mubi-South) who decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). It was learnt that the speaker, in April, declared vacant the seat of Ayuba Kwada who was rumoured to have defected from PDP to APC in a controversial circumstances and closed the assembly till August this year. Kwada had won APC ticket last month for House of Representatives to represent Michika/Madagali Federal Constituency in Adamawa State. Addressing journalists yesterday in Yola, the Secretary of APC, Mr. Raymond Chidama, accused the speaker of placing his personal interest above his oath of office. “The speaker of the Adamawa State House of Assembly earlier refused to declare the seat of Musa Umar vacant, but went ahead to quickly declare vacant the seat of Kwada who defected from PDP to APC. “This is a clear case of allowing his personal interest to interfere with his official conduct which is contrary to the oath of office administered on him when he assumed office,” he stated. Chidama, who cited the cases of former House of Representatives speaker, Yakubu Dogara vs PDP and Abegunde vs Ondo State House of Assembly to discredit the action of the speaker, said his party had briefed its counsel for full legal action against Abbas. Also yesterday, Chidama urged Senator Aishatu Binani, who won his party’s governorship ticket, and others that won the APC tickets to incorporate those that contested with them in their programmes. He said that there was no victor and no vanquished after the contest, advising all party members to exhibit a sportsmanship spirit in the interest of the party.
