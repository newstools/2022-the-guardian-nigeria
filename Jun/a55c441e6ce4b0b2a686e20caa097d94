The petrol scarcity being experienced in major Nigerian cities is taking a toll on commuters resulting in about 35 to 50 per cent hike in fares by transporters on some routes. The scarcity resurfaced in Lagos after the independent marketers, under the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) on Monday, said it was no longer sustainable to sell petrol at the official price of N162 to N165 per litre. This is as some filling stations have started selling the product at N180 per litre, with queues which started last Sunday, now extending even longer and disrupting traffic flow on some roads across the metropolis. It was observed on Wednesday that transporters charged N400 as against N300 from Iyana-Ipaja to Oshodi, while from Iyana-Ipaja to Ikeja, fares went up to N300 from N200. Similarly, commuting from Berger to Ojuelegba went up to N400 instead of N300, while passengers from Berger to CMS pay N800 instead of N600. Also, fares from Ketu to Costain rose to N400 from N300, leaving many passengers frustrated and stranded, especially as a limited number of buses were available on the road. The cost of commuting from Agbara to Mile 2 also rose from N300 to N500 just as hundreds of passengers who had hoped for better bargain got stranded at various bus stops, including Okokomaiko, LASU Gate and Volks. A commuter, Seun Akinlade, lamented the increase, saying it doubled his daily transportation expenses. “I am spending double the amount I normally spend on transportation. I am appealing to the government to quickly intervene and ensure the availability of fuel to reduce this suffering,” he said. A trader, Uche Ikeagwu, said he normally paid N600 from Iyana-Ipaja to Idumota, but that the fare had increased to N800. “We are three at the shop and this means I have to pay N2,400 for us to get to the shop. I don’t know how we can continue to do business like this.”
