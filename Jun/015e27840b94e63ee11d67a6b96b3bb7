The Idiroko Special Area Command of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is to celebrate this year’s United Nations International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking from June 24 to 28, with the theme, “Addressing drug challenges to health and humanitarian crises.” Activities for the one-week-long event include football and other sports, a road walk, sensitisation rally, lectures and health talks. The grand finale would feature a cultural performance, paper presentation, recitation and awards. According to the organisers, the event is to bring drug issues to the limelight in line with the global agency’s tenets on drug abuse. They said the targeted audience comprises secondary school pupils, non-faith and faith-based organisations, politicians, security officers and the public.
