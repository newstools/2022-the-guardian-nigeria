The Oyo State Police Command has confirmed the murder of a traffic warden, Oluniyi Bamidele, by some commercial drivers at the New Garage area of Ibadan on Thursday. The Command’s spokesman, Adewale Osifeso, in a statement, on Friday, in Ibadan, said “Oluniyi Bamidele, who was attached to the Challenge Police Divisional Headquarters, was attacked by commercial vehicle operators (Micra) after one of the operators contravened serious traffic offences. He explained that based on the false alarm raised to his colleagues, other commercial vehicle operators attacked the deceased and pushed him towards another oncoming commercial vehicle at top speed. He was knocked down and another Micra driver deliberately ran over his helpless body, which eventually led to his death on the spot. Osifeso: “The command has begun an investigation into the incident, as the Deputy Commissioner of Police-in-Charge of the Criminal Investigation Department has been directed to leave no stone unturned in apprehending those responsible for the cold-blooded murder of the traffic warden for prosecution in accordance with the law. “We enjoin the citizens to go about their lawful businesses without any fear of harassment in the state.”
