Edo State indigenes have created UNUEDO Renaissance, a group of professionals, aimed at supporting the government to find solutions to insecurity in the state. The group had held its first webinar recently with a focus on issues and challenges bedeviling the state to find workable immediate, medium to long-term solutions to them.
   
In a communiqué issued at the end of the event, the group disclosed that it drew participation from across the globe and that members raised their concerns about the need to make the state safe and secure for indigenes and visitors to thrive.
    
The President, Nuhu Yakubu, who welcomed participants to the maiden webinar series, said the aim was to offer a platform for the security personnel in Edo to discuss developments and compare notes with indigenes and residents.
    
The ultimate aim, he continued, was to enable cross-pollination of ideas towards finding a workable solution to the challenge.
