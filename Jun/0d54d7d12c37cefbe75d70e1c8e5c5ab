A Federal High Court, Abuja, yesterday, convicted and sentenced two co-defendants of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to two years imprisonment over drug deal. Delivering his judgment in a suit filed against Abba Kyari by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Justice Emeka Nwite, said: “Having admitted to have committed the offence preferred against them in counts 5, 6 and 7, Chibunna Umeibe and Emeka Ezenwanne, who are 6th and 7th defendants, “are hereby convicted accordingly.” The judge sentenced the duo to two years’ imprisonment in each of counts 5, 6 and 7.	The terms, he said, shall run concurrently, and would commence from the day the defendants were arrested by the NDLEA. Recall that Umeibe and Ezenwanne, who are 6th and 7th defendants respectively, were the two alleged drug traffickers arrested at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, by the police and handed over to the NDLEA. They had earlier pleaded guilty to counts five, six and seven in the charge preferred against them by the anti-narcotic
agency. MEANWHILE, the court has fixed July 18,19 and 20, for trial of Kyari and his men, as well as hearing of their fresh bail applications.
