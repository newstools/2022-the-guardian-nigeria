President, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has said the chairperson of Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL), Aisha Falode, who was recently appointed the country’s Chef de Mission/leader of a delegation to the Morocco 2022 African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON), is the Federal Government’s representative at the competition. Pinnick, who recalled that Falode was the leader of a delegation to the Ghana 2018 Women’s Nations Cup, which Nigeria won, said she has been found worthy to help motivate Nigeria to yet another victory, especially as the Super Falcons are going for the 10th title of the Nations Cup. Pinnick said: “She, in her capacity as Leader of Delegation, can ask anybody not part of the team to leave the team’s camp. She is the eye of the Nigerian government in Morocco. “She will be with the team from the beginning to the end of the tournament. Of course, you know her antecedent, she was in CAF for 10 years even before I came into CAF. She has been able to rebuild and rebrand the women league in Nigeria, Africa, and indeed, in the world, as one of the best. “I believe strongly that in the nearest future, she is going to be rewarded for changing the fortune of the women’s football league, by CAF and FIFA. And also for her ability and leadership capacity in the organisation and advancement of women’s football in Africa.” Responding, Falode promised to ensure that there is harmony in the team’s camp as leader of the delegation. She believes this is the only way the Super Falcons can win their 10th title and also qualify for the World Cup in Japan among other accolades at Morocco 2022. “We know the major focus of all the teams coming to Morocco is to defeat the Super Falcons of Nigeria, even if subsequently, they don’t win the cup, because of the dominance of the Nigerian team, but, bad for all the 11 teams competing, we won’t allow them.”
