Urhobo Progress Union (UPU), Worldwide, yesterday, denied ever endorsing the governorship candidate of Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Kenneth Gbagi, for the 2023 governorship election in Delta State. In a statement, the National Publicity Secretary of UPU, Abel Oshevire, said the attention of the union had been drawn to a wicked, mischievous and laughable report on social media purporting that Gbagi, Delta State governorship candidate of the SDP, had been endorsed by the apex Urhobo organisation. The statement reads: “We want to state emphatically for the records that the report is not only false and misleading but a desperate attempt to cause confusion and shatter the peace of the Urhobo nation as we approach the 2023 general elections.  The union advised Gbagi to desist from using the name of UPU and the President General, Olorogun Moses Taiga, to gain cheap popularity in his political adventure. “Governorship primaries of all political parties have come and gone. Thankfully, in answer to UPU’s desire and prayers, and that of the entire Urhobo nation, the next governorship election in Delta State is an all-Urhobo affair. We advise our Urhobo governorship candidates to market themselves across the state, to increase their chances at the general elections. False media materials from any governorship candidate, particularly one that seeks to cause disunity within our ranks, will only de-market the offending candidate and cast serious questions on his integrity. “We advise that rather than spreading falsehood of endorsement, all our Urhobo governorship candidates must hit the streets of the state and campaign for the votes of Deltans at the forthcoming election.”
