President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, officially received the Governor-elect of Ekiti State, Biodun Oyebanji, in Abuja. The newly-elected governor was led to the event by Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Governors Kayode Fayemi, Atiku Bagudu and Mohammed Badaru of Ekiti, Kebbi and Jigawa states. Stating that he keenly monitored the gubernatorial election at the weekend, the President applauded its orderly conduct and comportment of the electorate and security agencies. “I loved how the APC governors mobilised and supported you,” Buhari told Oyebanji. He added: “I think the party is very lucky and things are getting better. I congratulate the Chairman and I pray you sustain it.” In his remarks, Adamu ascribed the election victory to God, pledging that same would be replicated in Osun State next month.
Chairman of the Campaign Council for Ekiti, Governor Badaru congratulated the President on the successful outing. While appreciating the President, Oyebanji said the election was a referendum on the party, “and a clear, positive signal to the election in Osun and the national one next year. APC is still the party of choice.” He promised to be magnanimous in victory, as earlier advised by Buhari.
