ICT journalist and chronicler, Aaron Ukodie, is set to unveil a comprehensive book on the technology industry. The unveiling of the book, scheduled to hold on July 7, in Lagos, comes with a seminal discussion, under the eWorld Forum ’22, on how to further push forward the frontiers of broadband connectivity and the consolidation of 4G and deployment of 5G networks across the country. The eWorld Forum, which started in 2009, has contributed to the formulation of the policies and strategies that have helped the growth of the ICT industry. The minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Pantami, is expected to chair the event. Ukodie, who has written several books on the ICT industry, considers the new work, Nigeria’s Digital Drivers, his ICT industry star publication that captures the trajectories of the digital evolution, sector analysis, and players’ contributions. Apart from select key industry players, the book also highlighted, in a section, the emergence and the work of some of the most vibrant Nigerian journalists and media entrepreneurs whose relentless advocacy gave birth to the various policy thrusts that gave rise to the developments in the ICT sector. The 436-page book would serve as an important reference document and a coveted addition to personal and corporate libraries. It would be an exciting read for corporate Nigeria and the political class.
