Youths in Asaba, Delta State, yesterday, accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of frustrating efforts at gaining access into its office to collect their Personal Voter Cards (PVCs) for voting in the 2023 general elections. The youths, who cried out over what they called inhuman treatments, claimed they were on INEC premises as early as 7 a.m. to collect their PVCs but were kept waiting endlessly at the gate without any attention from officials. Their spokesperson, who simply gave her name as Adanie, decried what she described as the lackadaisical attitude of INEC officials and deliberately shutting their doors against them. The lady said she had been at the receiving end since the exercise commenced in Asaba, following unnecessary barriers by officials each time they went for their PVCs. She said: “We have been here since morning but nobody is attending to us. We are tired, no food and no place to sit and relax our heads.” But when contacted for reaction, the state INEC Director of Publicity, Mr. Bukola Ojome, said: “We did not lock the gate, but you know we are operating under COVID-19 protocol. So, there must be a certain number of people that will enter inside the registration centre, which is a small room. Ojeme said INEC was handling the situation and urged applicants to be patient until it gets to their turn, saying: “We are doing it batch by batch”.
