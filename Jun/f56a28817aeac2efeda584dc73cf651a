She is very pretty and independent.”   One thing Gen Z women love is being able to hold their own, they walk into a room, and all heads turn in their direction without saying anything. They’re the babes you want to follow on Instagram, and everyone aspires to be like. As a Gen Z baddie, you need to be ready and to stand out in the crowd, and we’ve got the right essentials for you. Here are some essentials you need to thrive as a Gen Z baddie: Every Baddie needs the right outfit. The right tops paired with the right bottoms accessorised with the perfect shoes and jewellery are the first step to embracing your “royal baddiness.” You’re not a baddie until you make people stop and stare at you for hours at a time. Oh! You don’t need to always show off some skin (even if its welcomed) to stand out; you just need to be in the business of looking good. So stock up on those bodycon dresses, biker shorts, y2k accessories, and slit clothes for the perfect clothing aesthetic.

We’re talking contour and highlights, edges laid flat, and lashes on fleek. But don’t forget the gloss, babe; glossy lips are the ultimate Baddie aesthetic.

Are you even a baddie if you’re not popping up at the best “outside” spots regularly? Probably not, your fans need to be able to see and recognise you, and you need to be outside to give them a show. Susan Pwajok Instagram @susanpwajok A healthy diet, regular exercises and self-care are crucial to the evolution of a Gen Z baddie. The Baddie is flawless, and her body has to match the confidence she exudes. Not a must, but if you love them, think tattoos and piercings; nothing says I’m here for a good time more than the right mods. Maintaining a high profile social media is necessary for every Gen Z baddie. You’d need the right camera to take the perfect Instagram worthy photos and the right poses to keep all eyes on you.
