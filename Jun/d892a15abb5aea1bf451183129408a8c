However, for a trendsetter like you, going to work is a golden opportunity to walk an office hallway like it’s your runway, showcasing your fabulous work outfits and giving your colleagues a healthy dose of fashion goodness. The pencil skirt is a simple and timeless clothing item that is at the heart of what we often refer to as ‘office’ clothes. Notable for the way it accentuates the curves and celebrates the woman’s body, the pencil skirt remains a staple in every woman’s wardrobe, and is a great choice for formal styling. While you may believe you already know how to properly style a pencil skirt, this article will show you how to do so in new and interesting ways.  Pencil Skirt with turtle necks You can never go wrong with a turtleneck top. Instead of wearing the same old silk shirt or chiffon blouse, try something new. Wearing a turtleneck with a pencil skirt exudes not only ‘bosslady’ vibes, but also elegance, especially when paired with hoop earrings. Pencil skirt and jackets or blazer Consider this a friendly reminder to always layer up. Pencil skirts look more professional when paired with a blazer, but if a blazer seems too formal, try a denim or leather jacket instead. This combo could be paired with a shirt, turtleneck, or even a strapless top. And if you wish to take things further, an ankle or mid calf boot would do the trick. Pencil skirt and Spaghetti strap tops While it’s understandable that most offices have a formal dress code, that doesn’t mean you can’t show off some skin and look sexy. A spaghetti strap top with a pencil skirt radiates empowerment and confidence. You could also wear a blazer or coat over it, if you are uncomfortable with showing skin. Pencil skirts and sweaters When it comes to this look, there is a fine line between looking years older than your age and actually pulling it off. Proper colour and design selection are the keys to looking chic and modern in this combination. For example, wearing a plain purple sweater over a red pencil skirt would be a disaster. Instead, pair a cream sweater with a dark brown leather pencil skirt. Remember that there are various types of pencil skirts available, so, don’t limit yourself to the standard black; try out different colours and fabrics.
