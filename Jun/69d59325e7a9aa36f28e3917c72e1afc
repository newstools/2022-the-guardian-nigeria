Gives awards to Gbajabiamila, Lotus Bank, Rite Foods, others The Ansar-Ud-Deen Society of Nigeria (ADSN) has urged Muslim Ummah to exercise their civic rights by obtaining their permanent voter cards (PVCs) and vote during the forthcoming 2023 elections. It said Nigerians should be more concerned about the competence of the candidates and not religious consideration. The ADSN made the charge during the society’s 10th triennial national conference in Lagos. Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, represented by Commissioner for Housing, Maruf Akinderu, in his speech, appreciated the group for the promotion of education and religious harmony in Nigeria. He further admonished parents and religious bodies to work together with the government to curb crimes. National Missioner, Ansar-Ud-Deen Nigeria and overseas, Sheikh AbdulRahman Ahmad, said a leader, who is not bothered about the security of the nation, should not be elected. Meanwhile, the group later conferred national merit awards on Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila and 30 other eminent Nigerians. Also, President of the group, AbdulRafiu Ademola Sanni, said the awardees were honoured in recognition for their contributions to good governance, upliftment of mankind and being worthy ambassadors of Islamic religion.
