Insurance professionals who gathered at this year’s 2022 edition of Fellows’ Hangout in Lagos organised by the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN) have been urged to structure their area of specialisation to promote industry awareness. The Chairman, Examination Committee, CIIN, Olusola Ladipo-Ajayi, who spoke on a paper titled: ‘Contributions of Fellows to the growth of the Institute’ at the CIIN 2022 Fellows’ night, said there is a need for collaboration between the institute’s relevant stakeholders to promote insurance awareness and place the industry on the path of growth. Ladipo-Ajayi tasked insurance fellows to hold meetings regularly and make recommendations that would assist the institute saddled with the responsibility of promoting insurance awareness. He implored them to join hands with the institute to audit course books; help to supervise examinations and assist in determining skills and knowledge programmes. Chairman, of the Society of Fellows, Prof. Joseph Irukwu, who was represented by the past President, Sunny Adeda, decried the number of fellows of the institution, which is 121, compared to India with 3,767 insurance fellows. Adeda beseeched insurance practitioners and the public to embrace the institute’s examinations, stressing that the insurance industry currently has less than 4,000 professionals. The President, CIIN, Dr. Muftau Oyegunle, charged the institute to determine a high standard of knowledge and skills for persons seeking to become registered members of the professional body, adding that he has strong confidence that this would help grow the industry.
