Apex Igbo socio-political organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, said Igbo people would only support the presidential candidate of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, if he chooses someone from the South East as his running mate and with a pledge to ensure that the zone produces his successor after four years. Secretary General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, stated this in Abakaliki after a meeting with PDP National Support Forum led by Dr. Ahmad Musa and the World Igbo Youth Congress led by Dr. Francis Anagha-Ufuoma. He insisted that PDP remains the only party for Igbos to achieve Igbo presidency in 2027. Isiguzoro noted that the consultative meetings were the aftermath of the presidential primaries of the political parties for the 2023 general election, which led to the emergence of Atiku of the PDP, Mr. Peter Obi of Labour Party and Bola Ahmed Tinubu of All Progressives Congress (APC) as the presidential candidates of their parties. He noted that supporting the candidate of the APC means that the South East would wait for another 16 years to produce president. He further urged Ndigbo, especially the youth, to aggressively obtain their PVCs before the closure of the exercise. Speaking, Musa urged Ndigbo not to dump the opposition party, which they joined hand to form in 1998 through Dr. Alex Ekwueme’s G34, saying PDP remains the only party for Igbos to achieve Igbo presidency in 2027.
