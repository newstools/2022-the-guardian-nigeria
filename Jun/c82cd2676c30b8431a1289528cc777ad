Speaking on her Facebook Watch show, Red Table Talk, she said that she hopes that “these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile.” Will Smith had reacted to a joke by Rock about her alopecia areata. Onstage, Rock said, “Jada, I love you. ‘GI Jane 2,’ in reference to her head and its comparison with Demi Moore’s in the 1997 film. Before the incident, Jada has always been open about experiencing hair loss due to the autoimmune disorder alopecia that impacts the hair follicles, resulting in both bald spots and hair loss. Apologising to the audience and organisers of the Oscars while receiving his award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for “King Richard”, Smith had said “love will make you do crazy things.”   A post shared by Guardian Life Magazine (@guardianlifeng)  In this episode which was dedicated to the hair loss disorder, she expressly stated that the world needs them as one.
“Now, about Oscar night, my deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile,” Pinkett Smith said on Red Table Talk. “The state of the world today, we need them both, and we all actually need one another more than ever. “Until then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that’s keep figuring out this thing called life together.” She continued, “Considering what I’ve been through with my own health and what happened at the Oscars, thousands have reached out to me with their stories.” One of those who reached out and who was a guest was Nicole Ball, the mother of a 12-year-old girl, Rio Allred, who committed suicide due to the bullying she received for her condition. Now called the “Will Smith Effect,” Chris Rock first made a joke about this at Dave Chappelle’s “Netflix is a joke” made a Will Smith joke during his appearance on stage at The Royal Albert Hall in London for his Ego Death comedy tour. Moreso, his brother, Kenny said he was ready to square up with the King Richard actor in a boxing ring fight.
