Similarly, all other indices finished lower last week except the NGX Growth index, which appreciated at 2.79 per cent, while the NGX Asem index closed flat.

Reacting to market performance, Vice President of Highcap Securities, David Adonri, said the rising insecurity in the country and other macroeconomic challenges, coupled with uncertainty in the global economy are fueling the decline in the equities market. Analysts at Cordros capital said: “With the significant moderation in the prices of bellwether stocks this week, we expect savvy investors to take advantage of this and make a re-entry into stocks with sound fundamentals and attractive dividend yields. “However, we do not rule out the possibility of continued profit-taking activities. As a result, we think the local bourse will likely exhibit a choppy pattern. Therefore, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks.” Analysts from Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: ” With continued sell-offs amid bearish sentiment in the market, we expect to see mixed trading sessions next week as investors continued to trade cautiously.” Furthermore, the breakdown of last week’s transactions indicated that the financial services industry led the activity chart with 692.3 million shares valued at N6.2 billion traded in 10,615 deals.
