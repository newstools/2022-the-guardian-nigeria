The Eighth Kwibuka Women’s T20 Tournament took a new turn with the introduction of a veterans’ exhibition match between Nigeria and Rwanda. The Nigerian team was captained by President of Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), Uyi Akpata, who said the game would further boost the collaboration between the two countries. “The Kwibuka event has a Nigerian bent, because it was conceived on the back of the bilateral cricket matches between the two countries’ women’s team. And the two teams are benefitting immensely from the growth of the tournament today,” Akpata said. Nigeria’s veterans, who majorly were from the TBS 4’O clock group, chalked 133 for the loss of four wickets in the first inning, while the Rwandan team capped it in 16.5 over scoring to win with four wickets. “We lost this but the experience and the bonding has been something that we would look to strengthen. I am confident more growth will be built on the experience of coming together of these cricket power houses.”
