During the dry season, dryness and sweating are two worries many people have before applying a full face of makeup. For the rainy season this time, your two major worries would be humidity and dampness, so you need to choose waterproof makeup products that can withstand changes in the weather. To help you figure this out, here are some great tips for putting on makeup during the rainy season. Opt for lighter looks over layers of makeup to keep your skin and makeup in prime condition. More layers of makeup clog up the skin pores, meaning your makeup will likely slide off once you start to sweat. On the other hand, light makeup allows your skin pores to breathe, ensuring that your face beat stays flawless all day. Just because it’s cold doesn’t mean you shouldn’t worry about your makeup sliding off. Come rain or shine; you need a great moisturiser and primer to keep your face bright and ready. Humid weather can cause your skin to dry out, so choose a water-based moisturiser that absorbs oil and pairs great with your foundation for a bright, hydrated finish. Once you’ve applied your moisturiser, go in with a matte primer for a long-lasting finish and a smooth surface to work with. Creamy makeup products are more likely to melt and leave a mess if you do get caught in the rain. Instead, replace your creamy makeup products with powder ones. A powder foundation leaves a matte, long-lasting finish without blotches. Complete your base with a mattifying powder, one with a lightweight formula is a great choice. Dust your face and neck with the powder to absorb moisture. Finish your eye makeup with pressed or powder-based blush and eyeshadow to avoid smudging and melting. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1769780 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="855" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup.jpg 1550w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup-896x598.jpg 896w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup-1536x1026.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup-320x214.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Makeup-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Lip glosses and creamy lipsticks are quick to bleed during humid weather. So opt for transfer-proof matte lipsticks. To make sure your lipstick stays in place, apply a balm or moisturiser first and wait for about 20 minutes before applying a matte lipstick. Concealer is a must-have, and as effective as they are in covering up blemishes, concealers may also cause your makeup to look thick and cakey. The rule to fix this is less is more. And to opt for oil free concealers that wouldn’t look cakey when paired with your other matte, powder based products. Using an oil free concealer also makes your face look less oily. If you prefer BB creams, one coat of an oil-free light BB cream is all you need. Finally, apply a finishing powder for an even skin tone. As fun as dancing in the rain sounds, you might want to avoid getting caught in the rain and be well-prepared if you have to. So for your eye makeup, choose a waterproof mascara that lengthens and volumises your eyelashes. For your eyeliner, find a buildable, smudge-proof and water resistant product. Choose light hues like pink, beige, light, and pastel browns for a cheery bright finish for your eye makeup. All your hard work shouldn’t go to waste, so use a setting spray once you’re done with your makeup to make sure it stays in place for as long as you need it to. Hold the setting spray away from your face and spray in a downward motion, three times on each side and in the middle. Rainy seasons are a better time than ever to pull out your best waterproof, matte makeup products. Nothing, not even humidity, should stop you from looking your best all day long.
