Say Abiodun’s performance reason for dumping PDP No fewer than 5,000 members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State have defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The defectors, who were members of Ladi Adebutu and late Senator Buruji Kashamu’s factions in the party in Iperu, Ikenne Local Council of the state, were received by Governor Dapo Abiodun on Wednesday. Abiodun, while receiving the defectors, thanked them for joining the ruling party, stating that the inclusiveness and open door policy being adopted by the current administration has attracted many members of other political parties to pitch their tent with the APC. “I want to assure you that you will be given equal treatment as every member of the party is one family. This government is your government and we are ready to accommodate whoever is ready to join hands with us towards development of the state, irrespective of religious, political or tribal affiliation. “Our party is focused and committed to the transformation of the state. Since the inception of the current administration, a lot of developmental projects, including road reconstruction, rehabilitation of primary health centres, youths’ empowerment, among others, had been carried out in all the three senatorial districts of the state,” the governor stated. He urged the defectors to obtain their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to enable them exercise their civic rights during the general elections next year. “Elections are coming up next year and for you to take part, I want you to go and get your PVC. This is the card that will allow you exercise your civic responsibilities and the power to choose those you want to govern you”, he advised. Also, Shittu, who spoke on behalf of the new entrants, commended the governor for the massive infrastructural development across the state. He added that the reason behind their action was to work and support the governor in his aspiration for a second term in office.
