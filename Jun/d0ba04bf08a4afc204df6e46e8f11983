Nigerian female hurdler, Tobi Amusan, made big headlines in Paris, France last night, setting a new African record 12.41seconds in the final of the 100m hurdles. Amusan, who narrowly missed a medal at the Tokyo Olympics, started slowly in yesterday’s Diamond league in Paris, but picked up midway to finish in 12.41seconds. The Nigerian, who has been in spectacular form since placing 4th at the Tokyo Olympics was cheered around the stadium by thousands of spectators who came from around the world to be part of the event. With the new African record in her kitty, Amusan will surely be one of the athletes to watch at the 2022 World Athletics Championship in Oregon, U.S. next month and the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England from July 28 to August 8. Amusan is expected to arrive in Nigeria tomorrow for the AFN National Trials in Benin City, Edo State. Technical Director of the AFN, Samuel Onikeku was excited with Amusan’s new record saying; “It is a great night for Nigeria and African athletics.”
