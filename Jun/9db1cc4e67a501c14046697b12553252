The President of the Nigeria Cricket Federation, Uyi Akpata, who is in Kigali, Rwanda, to support the women’s national team, has described the country’s participation in the Kwibuka Invitational Championship as one of the ways the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) is developing the nation’s game. Akpata watched Nigeria’s last round-robin match in which they lost to the host, Rwanda, on Thursday. Tanzania won the championship, which featured teams from across the world. According to Akpata: “Every time the team shows up at Kwibuka, we see this as part of our developmental journey. We lost today and I am sure members of the technical team have their notes full. “Another interesting dimension is that we have a couple of players here that will form the core of Nigeria’s under 19 teams and this experience will surely be an asset to them,” he added. The Nigerian team at the Kwibuka T20 started the event with three back-to-back wins over Brazil, Germany and Botswana before crumbling in their last four outings against Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. Nigeria had won the toss and elected to field against the host on Thursday, one that held the Rwandan Women to a 91 for the loss of seven wickets at the end of the first inning. The Nigeria Women struggled to a 68 total with four wickets in hand to close in the second inning. Nigeria faced Brazil in their last match, which served as a determent of the fifth and sixth-placed teams at the event. Speaking on the tournament, Nigeria’s coach, Leke Oyede, said there is room for improvement, which could only come when the players are subjected to tough games like the ones the Kwibuka offered. “We are hoping to give a decent ending to this series with a good show in our last match.” Nigeria also presented a team in an elite match between a Nigerian who selected over 50 sides against Rwanda’s selected side. The match was an exhibition match meant to strengthen ties between the countries.
