The group in a statement by its secretary,  Mr Bayo Aina, said the Northern Governors have shown that they meant well for the country and are ready to make sacrifices for the wellbeing of Nigerians. It pointed out that the decision will not only give all Nigerians a sense of belonging but erase the impression that the North wants to lord it over the south at all times Meanwhile, the group has condemned the attack and killings of worshippers at St Francis Catholic Church, Owo on Sunday,  describing the attack as another attempt by agents of darkness to instil fears in the hearts of Yoruba people. It commiserates with the state governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu, the government and the people of Ondo State over the incident. The group called on security agents to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to book. It said it was saddened by the development which apparently was a retaliation for the efforts of the Amotekun at stamping out criminality from the nook and crannies of the state.
