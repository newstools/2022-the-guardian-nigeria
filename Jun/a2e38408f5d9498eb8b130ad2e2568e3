The Coalition of Arewa Forum for Good Governance and Governor (CAFGG) has frowned at unnecessary delays by Presidential candidates across parties in picking their running mates.
  
The group, however, commended the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) Presidential candidate, the former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, for being the first candidate to pick his running mate for the election. 
  
The group also noted that Nigerians are worried about the choice of running mates picked by individual presidential candidates because they determine the future stability of the country.  “Nigerians can’t afford to face any sectarian crisis caused by a lopsided political arrangement, in addition to the current problem of banditry and terrorist activities. Atiku has proved to be more prepared for the race ahead than others.”
