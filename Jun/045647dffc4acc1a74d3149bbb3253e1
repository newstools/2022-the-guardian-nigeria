The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), yesterday, warned the Federal Government against handing over 17 of the nation’s airports to cronies in the guise of concession.
  
HURIWA in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said that the outgoing Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, might want to give out the airports as parting gifts to incompetent family members and friends, as his tenure ends in less than 11 months.
