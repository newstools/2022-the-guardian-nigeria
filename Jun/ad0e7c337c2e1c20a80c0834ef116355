MEANWHILE, to bring back those whose telephone lines were blocked, following the directive by the Federal Government in April, which mandated the telecoms operators to bar outgoing calls from telephone lines not linked, telecoms operators are wooing subscribers with new promo. About 75 million lines were affected by the April directive, and it later appeared that after making several efforts to re-link the lines, some subscribers experienced various forms of difficulties and had subsequently dropped some of the lines. In May, MTN claimed that some 19 million subscribers were affected, while Airtel Nigeria, said that only 35.9 million out of its 44.4 million active customers had linked their NIN with their SIMs as of the end of April. It subsequently means that 8.5 million customers of the telco were yet to comply and have been placed on ‘receive only’. Recognising the fact that every single line blocked would amount to revenue loss, the telcos have device means targeted at wooing back the affected subscribers. For instance, Globacom has introduced ‘Glo NIN Offer.’ Commenting on the launch of the adverts, the company noted that the “Glo NIN Offer is a one-time bonus offer applicable only to customers who were barred from making outgoing calls on the Glo network as directed by regulatory authorities due to NIN non-compliance.” Once subscribers link their NIN to their SIMS, they will get a N20,000 bonus which can be used to call, browse and text on the network. Also, Airtel has called on affected subscribers to re-link their lines and get N20,000 free airtime and data credit.
