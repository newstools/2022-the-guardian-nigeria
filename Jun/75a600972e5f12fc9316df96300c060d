I believe in your ability, capacity, competence, says Ooni The candidate of the Accord Party (AP) for Osun State governorship election, Mr. Akin Ogunbiyi, has said that he has the capacity and competence to turn the state around if elected into office. Ogunbiyi, who stated this while addressing newsmen in Ile-Ife shortly after he led his campaign team to the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, urged the people of the state to hand over their destinies to him for the next four years, saying that he knows how to manage resources and pull talents together to achieve beneficial results. “You can only give what you have. I am a tested and trusted leader of men and resources. I am a successful entrepreneur. I also have empathy,” he said. He promised to set Osun State on the path of sustainable development, saying: “There will definitely be a paradigm shift on which I will ensure productive transformation. I will be the champion of productive development and not political grandstanding.” The AP candidate said that his coming into the party to contest the governorship election had given him the voice, recognition and popularity, adding: “My reputation goes beyond Osun, and I didn’t earn the reputation through politics, but through what I have been contributing to the Nigerian economy in my little way.” Earlier, while welcoming Ogunbiyi to the Royal Court, the Ooni of Ife said: “You are a gentleman who is highly intelligent. I believe in your ability, capacity and competence to lead Osun State.”
