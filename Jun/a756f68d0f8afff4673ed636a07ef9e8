Stakeholders in Taraba State have called on philanthropists to help resuscitate the Jolly Nyame Stadium in Jalingo, which is in a deplorable state. Speaking during the Aiteo Cup final at the weekend, Chairman, Taraba State Football Association, Timothy Magaji and the state’s Director of Sports, George Shitta, said putting the stadium in good shape would boost sports in Taraba. Jolly Nyame Stadium  They also agreed that the state government cannot shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the stadium and the facilities alone and called on philanthropists to consider coming to the rescue. Citing how philanthropists have helped rehabilitate the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, Shitta said extending the same gesture to the Jolly Nyame Stadium would boost Nigeria’s sports development. “We are appealing to private individuals to come in, as government alone cannot do it. The stadium in Abuja was renovated by Dangote and the one in Lagos was renovated by Baba Ijebu. Jolly Nyame Stadium will be better if it gets such support,” he said. On the just-concluded Aiteo Cup, Magaji said it was used to scout for future stars for the state’s professional football club, Taraba FC. 12 teams participated in the competition, with Gamji FC emerging winners after defeating Nasarawo United in the finals.
