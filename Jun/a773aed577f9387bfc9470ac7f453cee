Many people have been killed in an apparent terror attack on a church in Owo, Ondo State in southwest Nigeria. Eyewitnesses told The Guardian that the St. Francis Catholic Church located on Owa-luwa Street in Owo was attacked by gunmen, who first opened fire on worshippers on Sunday morning before detonating an explosive device in the church. Owo is the hometown of the state governor Rotimi Akeredolu. One of the eyewitnesses, Mr Kehinde Ogunkorode, said there were a lot of casualties on the church premises, which is not far away from the palace of Olowo of Owo, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye, Akeredolu described the attack as a “satanic” and “calculated assault on the peace-loving people of Owo”. “It is a black Sunday in Owo,” the governor said, adding that he cut short his stay in Abuja for the national convention of the ruling All Progressives Congress to return to the state. “Our hearts are heavy. Our peace and tranquility have been attacked by the enemies of the people. This is a personal loss, an attack on our dear state. “This is an unexpected development. I am shocked to say the least. Nevertheless, We shall commit every available resource to hunt down these assailants and make them pay. We shall never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in our resolves to rid our state of criminals.”
