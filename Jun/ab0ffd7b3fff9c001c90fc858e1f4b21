An upcoming artist, Mustapha Aduragbemi Yahaya, also known as Theekidd, has advised Nigerian youths to desist from violence, kidnapping, Internet fraud, ritual killings, criminality and other social vices.  “Youths should not depend on the government to do everything for them. They should rise up and discover themselves. “They should develop their talents and build on them, instead of engaging in quick money-making syndrome that can lead to rituals that will cut their lives short,” Yahaya said.
