It is expected that when we hold such a big event, like the national convention, we make sure we have a befitting outing.” The secretariat has lately been a beehive of activities, with governors and members of the convention organising committee holding meetings to ensure the successful conduct of the exercise. Presidential aspirants cleared by the party to participate in the primaries are Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, Senators Ibikunle Amosun and Ajayi Borrofice, Governors Yahaya Bello (Kogi), Abubakar Badaru (Jigawa), Dave Umahi (Ebonyi), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), and Ogbonaya Onu, Chibuike Amaechi, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba and Tein Jack-Rich. At the Eagle Square venue of the primaries, artisans and various adhoc staff of the party were seen putting finishing touches to the podium and other facilities. Heavily armed security personnel could be seen at strategic locations, keeping the peace. Also, delegates and party stalwarts booked up major hotels within the city, even as a significant increase in traffic was noticed. THE Police Command in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), meanwhile, has announced traffic diversions. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), in the FCT, DSP Josephine Adeh, said this in a statement, yesterday.

She said areas closed to traffic include: Goodluck Ebele Jonathan Road by Court of Appeal, behind Court of Appeal, ECOWAS by Women Affairs, Finance Junction, behind Foreign Affairs, Kur Mohammed, by National Mosque and Benue Plaza.
