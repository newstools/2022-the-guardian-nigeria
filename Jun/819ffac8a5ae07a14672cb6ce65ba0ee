Environmentalist, Nnimmo Bassey, has donated a library/resource centre to St. Mary’s Secondary Commercial School, lkot Nseyen in Ikono Council of Akwa Ibom State. The school, a public school established in the 1970s, had suffered neglect for years. Chairman of the state Secondary Education Board, Ekaete Ebong, speaking before the commissioning of the edifice, thanked the donor for the sacrifice and for having the interest of children, whom she described as the future generation, at heart. She said: “The students have been challenged to come here and study and get more knowledge. I, therefore, urge all of you to shun cultism and other social vices and make good use of the facility provided for you.” The principal of the school, Mr. Charles Isok, while commending the donor, begged government and individuals to provide safe drinking water for students. In an interview, Bassey, who is also the director of Health Of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) said: “No matter the work you do, what you want to become, reading various books is very important as one is mostly influenced by the type of book one reads. Children should be reading or have books even before they enter school.”
