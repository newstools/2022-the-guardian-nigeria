The Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) will collaborate with the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) on the movement of cargo and other postal services to boost Nigeria’s economy. Postmaster General of the Federation, Dr. Ismail Adebayo Adewusi who stated this when he met with the Managing Director/CEO, NRC, Fidet Okhiria in Abuja, said that the collaboration is geared towards taking advantage of NRC’s extensive rail networks on the movement of cargo and mail items across Nigeria. According to him, in the past, NIPOST had a robust relationship with the Nigeria Railway Corporation that we need to go back to. “One of those areas is the presence of our postal services along railway outlets across Nigeria. We believe that with your expanded rail network, we want to have a physical presence in most of your locations, so that we can operate as an agency to provide services in those areas. This collaboration between NIPOST and NRC will shorten our delivery time and enhance our quality of service. In response, Okhiria expressed willingness to partner with NIPOST for the benefit of Nigeria’s economic growth. “NRC is willing to partner and collaborate with NIPOST and the proposal and request will be put into black and white”, he said.
