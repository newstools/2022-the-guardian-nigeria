Focus of many African athletics-lovers will be on Ivory Coast speedster, Marie-Josee Ta Lou, as she takes on top stars like Mujinga Kambundji, Dafne Schippers and three-time Olympic champion, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, at the 2022 Diamond League Meeting today in French capital, Paris. The seventh leg of the 2022 Diamond League series will be on SuperSport Variety 3 (DStv channel) and SuperSport Select 1 (GOtv channel 33). The Meeting de Paris at Stade Sebastien Charlety will also feature a stacked Men’s Pole Vault competition, featuring Sam Kendricks, Renuad Lavillenie and Thiago Braz, as well as local favourites Quentin Bigot and Alexandra Tavernier, who will be looking to claim top spot in the Men’s and Women’s Hammer Throw respectively, an events which have previously been overlooked in the Diamond League. “It’s a real reward for us, who perform with the hammer. There were the other three throws in Diamond League, all that was missing was us! It’s progressing little by little and it’s a real pleasure,” Tavernier stated.
