PAN-Igbo socio-political pressure group, the South East Revival Group (SERG), has given reasons why all Nigerians, irrespective of tribe, religion or political affiliation, should support the candidature of Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The group said Nigeria is at a crossroads and Nigerians do not need to gamble at this critical time. SERG, in a statement signed by its President and National Coordinator, Chief Willy Ezugwu, explained: “Obi remains the only presidential candidate who can explain how he became rich. “Nigeria needs urgent help to survive the next four years. “ Obi stands out as one who has been tested without any baggage of corruption trailing his past. “So, for us to move forward as a country at this time, we need a leader who has what it takes to stop the country’s economic drift at this moment. “He has been a governor of a state and has unequalled scorecard, which none of his opponents have, especially in tackling the country’s economic and security challenges.
