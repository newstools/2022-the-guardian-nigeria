He added that the State has implemented over 2,800km of 3,000km of Fibre Metro Network in Phase I of the Unified Duct project, noting that the broadband infrastructure rollout is to enable rapidity in commercial activities, government services, social connectivity and technological development through the provision of Internet access. The commissioner disclosed that in Lagos State, the Babajide Sanwo-Olu led government is keen on making Lagos the citadel of digital enterprise, a fertile market for imperial investment and an urban hub of innovation and commerce. ‘The high-speed Internet connectivity that will come from the metro-network cables would be used at homes, schools, healthcare facilities and Government’s offices for improved service delivery. The infrastructure would also boost e-commerce activities and empower innovation start-ups’, Fahm noted. He added that the project will enable the Telecom companies to rapidly expand mobile services in Lagos and provide a more efficient, fast and affordable broadband connectivity in the State. Fahm said the unified duct project will serve as a natural distribution of infrastructure for broadband capacity all over Lagos, thus becoming the technology pillar of the State Government’s THEMES agenda.
