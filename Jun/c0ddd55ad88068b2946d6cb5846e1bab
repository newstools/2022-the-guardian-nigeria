• Vow indefinite strike till demands are met Hundreds of aggrieved workers have shut the National Assembly complex over alleged non-payment of their entitlements. Under the aegis of Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), the protesters protest barricaded the entrances to the facility amid solidarity songs to press home their demands. The demonstration reportedly began on Monday, before being put on hold on Tuesday and Wednesday due to the convention of All Progressives Congress (APC) convention at the Eagles Square, and resumed yesterday, according to some PASAN officials. Chairman of the group, Comrade Sunday Sabiyyi, in a chat with The Guardian, accused the National Assembly management of “abdicating its responsibility on welfare” of his members over the years. He said: “Precisely, this issue did not start today. It has been lingering for more than seven to eight years. Now, we have all the items in the conditions of service, which the management is not considering. “The National Assembly staff have been suffering due to non -payment of their salaries and allowances. Out of the six allowances, we are only enjoying one. Somebody is sick, and nobody is taking care of him. “Under the civil service rules, if you are sick, your office has to take care of you. Here in the National Assembly, even Panadol, you have to buy it yourself. The minimum wage approved since April 2019 has not been paid  to us despite series of meetings.” The PASAN chief vowed that his members would continue the industrial action indefinitely until the management meets their demands.
