The singer made this known during a question-and-answer session on Instagram. When a fan inquired about if Burna Boy was on the soon-to-be-released album by the popular artist, Omah Lay simply responded by saying, “E dey, but I go remove am.” Omah Lay, who recently wrapped up a tour with Canadian superstar Justin Bieber, didn’t elaborate on the reasons for dropping Burna Boy from his album. Burna boy was recently caught in an incident that happened last week at the well-known Lagos club Cubana. It was said that police officers working for the Grammy Award winner shot a married man in the club after he warned Burna Boy not to approach his wife. According to reports, Lawrence Irebami, a married woman who was at the VIP section of the club with some other women, was called by one of the police officers after Burna Boy instructed him to do so. However, the husband resisted the singer’s attempts to humiliate him, which resulted in a shootout in which the husband and a friend of his were seriously injured.
