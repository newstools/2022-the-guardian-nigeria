Sometimes, success looks easier when you get to the top, but it is very difficult to sustain it. “What we have been able to do as a club from the management level to the players is we have tried to maintain the momentum. And this is what gave us victory at the end of the first phase, and we are happy about it. But we will be happier if we can retain the title by winning the second phase,” he said. Coach Yola, who commended his players for their unbeaten runs, said the team became the first club to win the first phase of the league without losing a match. “It is because of the effort of the management that paved way for the team’s success. Taking care of the players’ welfare had been why the players have excelled over the last year. There is still plenty to play for by the time the second phase begins,” he stated.
