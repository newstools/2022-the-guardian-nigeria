It takes only a few minutes to learn what to do but more than a lifetime to master it, if indeed, anyone can be said to ever master it. Most professionals will tell you that you can only enjoy good returns when you invest for the long-term. Over time, stocks or cryptocurrencies are more likely to weather the inevitable bull and bear runs of the market. It’s not impossible to profit short-term but it is not easily done and requires strong discipline amongst many other skills. So, here we examine three coins that we think represent good investments in 2022, Tron (TRX), Filecoin (FIL) and Chronoly (CRNO). Tron (TRX) takes action and recovers Just a few weeks after TerraUSD lost its peg against the US dollar and unleashed havoc in the global crypto markets, another stablecoin is looking highly unstable.  However, it looks that a sound approach has helped to avert the tragedy thus far. The Tron (TRX) price dropped to around $0.045 after it became known that the blockchain’s stablecoin, USDD, had slipped its peg against the US dollar.  The stable coin had dropped to $0.9764, a new low. To keep the USDD peg, TRON DAO has infused over $2 billion into the Tron reserve leading to a dramatic recovery. Filecoin (FIL) watchers are getting a bit bullish Filecoin’s price increased the most in January 2018, when it reached $10.30. This trend, however, did not last long, as the stock fell to $10.04. By November 2018, the price of Filecoin (FIL) had plunged to $09.20, and by June 2020, it had only slightly recovered to $12.10. The success of Filecoin in 2019 pleasantly surprised investors, as the FIL price climbed to $19.35. Despite the negative market trends, technical examination of the Filecoin price shows a significant increase driven by Filecoin growth. In comparison to peers such as Stellar and Ethereum, the Filecoin (FIL) price has surged dramatically. The Filecoin price is $5.78 at the time of writing and industry buffs are feeling very bullish about Filecoin as the year goes on. Chronoly (CRNO) is inciting growing excitement Chronoly.io was created on the Ethereum blockchain as a unique concept: investors don’t just buy another coin but invest in a small fraction of an investment-grade watch.  Holders don’t have to worry about the high entry barriers that come with buying a premium timepiece with Chronoly.io. Traditional investors can benefit from the asset-backed option as it would ease their entry into the crypto markets. Users will be able to stake their Chronoly (CRNO) tokens for passive income once their staking platform is live after presale. Excitement about Chronoly, which is actually still in its presale phase, is growing rapidly and this is reflected in the exponentially rising value. Since its presale began on May 5th, the price has risen from $0.01 to $0.05 and analysts are predicting that it could top $0.50 by the time of launch on Uniswap giving a 1,000% gain on your investment if buying in now. This will give a 5,000% return to those early presale investors. Chronoly has got superior potential over the likes of Filecoin and Tron. Being a new crypto, it has caught the attention of many analysts worldwide who predict that Chronoly will become a unicorn company within 2023. With the fall of Terra and the UST depegging this is a solid opportunity for investors to back a new ‘stablecoin’ but with much greater potential to produce those 1,000x returns that backers are looking for.
