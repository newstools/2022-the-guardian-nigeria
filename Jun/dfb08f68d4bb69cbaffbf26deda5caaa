The six-week trial took place in Fairfax, Virginia, and Depp was awarded $50 million. After the actress lost the case, a Saudi guy has now offered to marry her in an odd turn of events. He said he was better than ‘old man’ Johnny Depp in a voice message to her official Instagram account. Amber should marry him, he suggested, because she doesn’t have anything else. Johnny Depp sued Amber Heard for defamation after she wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post in 2018 in which she described herself as a victim of domestic abuse. Despite the fact that she did not name Depp, his legal team had demanded a $50 million settlement. A Saudi man has proposed to Depp now that he has won the lawsuit. According to Gulf News, the Saudi man promises to enrich her life with joy and happiness in a voice note placed on the actress’s official Instagram account. In a voice note which has gone popular on social media he said, “Amber since all doors are closing on you, you have no one except me to take care of you. I’ve noticed that some people hate and bully you, therefore, I decided to marry you. May Allah bless us both. You are a blessing, but people don’t appreciate that. I am better than that old man.”
