The Special Adviser to Senate President, Mr Ola Awoniyi, has denied the alleged defection of his boss, Ahmed Lawan, from the All Progressive Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The reaction is coming days after a viral video claimed that the Senate President has defected to the PDP. In a statement, yesterday, Awoniyi, while describing the viral video as false and mischievous, explained that the original video clip, which is three minutes, 30 seconds, was when Lawan was reading the letter by His Excellency, Senator Muhammad Adamu Ailero of Kebbi State, informing the plenary of his defection from the APC to the PDP over issues in the state chapter of the APC. He noted that the video was doctored to give the wrong impression that Lawan has renounced his membership of APC. “For the avoidance of doubt, Senator Ahmad Lawan is a committed member of the APC and has no reason whatsoever to renounce his membership of the party,” he stated. “Members of the public are hereby enjoined to discountenance the video in reference as it is the handiwork of mischief-makers.”
