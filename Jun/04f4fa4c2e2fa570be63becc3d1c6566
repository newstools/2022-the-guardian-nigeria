The much-anticipated album features her husband, Adekunle Gold, and guest appearances from Deja and Fave. “To Be Honest” is Simi’s fourth studio album, following her 2019 “Omo Charlie Champagne, Vol. 1.” Speaking to Cool FM back in May, Simi spoke about combining motherhood with her craft. She said, “I think it is all about prioritizing and committing to your priorities. The more important things you have in your life, the less time to dedicate to all these things. What is even important is understanding this is hard before you even go into it so that it doesn’t overwhelm you so much.” “I love my family, I love my daughter, I love my husband, and I love music so much, so it’s just finding that balance and committing to it.” “Because I just saw my future, so I was trying to get ahead of the whole thing because I know it is going to be hard like being responsible for another human’s life, and you know, it is not something I just want to delegate to someone else while I do other things. I’m a very hands-on mum; it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, but it was necessary, so I had to do it.” Many Nigerians have taken to Twitter to applaud the new album. @YomYom_ wrote, “Listened to Simi’s TBH album God Bless our SOUND ENGINEERS! Story Story, Loyalty, Temper and NO JOY be my instant Favs.” @Ricchly_iCONic tweeted, “All songs on Simi’s album are so good i can’t even pick a top favourite yet, after listening on repeat for almost 4haars.” “Nah this simi’s album is heavenly!!” @CollinsOkonta3.
