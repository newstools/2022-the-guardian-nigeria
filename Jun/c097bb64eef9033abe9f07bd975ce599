On a Sunday and other days in most Nigerian homes, it is one dish to be served. The rice is so popular that there is the Ghana jollof and Nigerian jollof war that ensues. However, the victor is yet to be known. Again, the winner lies in the taste buds of the eater and the delicate skills of the cook. Since it has a regular way of popping up, it has been explored in ways of being cooked or revamped to keep it fresh in most kitchens. If not the staple white rice and stew, it could come as jollof rice, palm oil rice, fried rice, or as this recipe has it, “pepper soup jollof rice.” INGREDIENTS Long Basmati Rice
