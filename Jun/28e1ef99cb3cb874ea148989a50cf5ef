Plateau State House of Assembly will host a lot of freshers in 2023, as many of the current members could not secure return tickets from their various political parties. Only eight of those who sought re-election secured tickets in the recent primary elections conducted by the political parties in the state. Four of the members vied for seats in the National Assembly while 18 sought re-election to the Assembly. However, only seven got the tickets. Nanbol Listick of Langtang North-North constituency, who could not secure a return ticket to the House on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), quickly picked the Labour Party (LP) ticket in a desperate bid to return to the Assembly. With the development, even if the eight members, who secured the tickets of their political parties emerge victorious in their re-election bid, 16 freshers will surely come on board. Deputy Speaker of the House, Saleh Yipmong (Dangi constituency) contested the Plateau Central senatorial seat, but lost to former member of the Assembly, Diket Plang from Pankshin North. The Deputy Majority Leader, Wallok Goma, contested Pankshin/Kanke/Kanam federal constituency on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), but lost to the incumbent, Yusuf Gagdi from Kantana constituency. Former Deputy Speaker and one of the oldest members of the House, Ibrahim Hassan, contested and won the APC ticket for Jos North/Bassa federal constituency, while the Minority Leader, Peter Gyendeng, from Barkin Ladi state constituency also contested and won the PDP ticket for the Barkin Ladi/Riyom federal constituency. Out of the four, who aspired higher seats, two secured their party tickets while two could not. Out of the seven PDP members, who sought re-election, only Timothy Dantong (Riyom), Dalyop Gwottson (Jos South) and Bala Fwangje (Mangu South) their party return tickets. Meanwhile, aggrieved Abok Ayuba has dumped APC for PDP.
