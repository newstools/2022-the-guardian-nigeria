Olympics silver medalist, Blessing Oborududu, World Wrestling Championships silver medalist, Odunayo Adekuoroye and 2017 National Youth Games Champion, Esther Kolawole, will be part of this year’s third United World Wrestling Matteo Pellicone Ranking Series. The championship holds from June 22 to 25 in Ostia, Rome, Italy. Nigeria Wrestling Federation Women Head Coach, Purity Akuh, told The Guardian, yesterday, that the championship is part of the training programme for the three wrestlers ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, United Kingdom. “Three of our women wrestlers, Oborududu (68 kg), Adekuoroye (57kg) and Kolawole (55kg) will be participating in the ranking series holding in Rome, Italy. Thereafter, they will now concentrate on the Commonwealth Games holding next month. “Though the sports ministry is yet to open a camp for the athletes, the President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali, has provided an open camp for the athletes, here at our Olympics Centre in Bayelsa State. This is to enable them to come together and start training ahead of the championship in Rome,” he said. He added: “Already, Adekuoroye is in the country from Canada, so that she can train with us in the camp and also travel together for the trip to Italy for the ranking series. After the ranking series, Adekuoroye might fly back to Canada. And may be from there, she can fly to Birmingham straight. “The federation is still trying to see if it can write her school to release her for us to monitor her in training before the Games. Thereafter, she can then return to her school.”
