Founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State, Saidu Salihu, has advised Governor Yahaya Bello to relocate to Lokoja, sit up and make the best use of the remaining part of his tenure. Bello has less than a year to complete his second term in office as Kogi governor. In a statement issued in Lokoja, the erstwhile Commissioner for Budget and Planning in the state, said the outcome of the recent APC special convention, where Bello came a distant fifth, showed that majority of the delegates from Kogi did not believe in the governor’s presidential adventure. Salihu, a former Kogi lawmaker and aspirant in the recent APC House of Representatives primary for Lokoja/Kotonkarfe Constituency, described Bello’s dismal performance at the presidential primary as a clear testament to his unimpressive performance as governor, having failed to harvest all the 63 delegate votes from the state. The Galadima of Kotonkarfe said: “Finally, the presidential primary election of our great party, the APC, has come and gone. Congratulations to the winner and flag-bearer. “For my governor and only aspirant from Kogi. It is time to take a deep and sober reflection of your over six years stewardship in Kogi, especially the leadership of our party. You have over one year left on the saddle as governor.” I think it is time you commit yourself to improve governance, so that history can manage to be fair to you and your administration.” He advised Bello to stop “the Abuja jamboree,” where almost all the government officials stay, abandoning their various duty posts. “We fought hard under the leadership of the late Abubakar Audu to dislodge the Peoples democratic Party (PDP) in our state. Let your performance as governor and party leader not be a cause of losing the state back to PDP. “A stich in time saves nine. This is an advice from a concerned stakeholder, who fought like a true soldier of democracy to bring about APC administration in our dear state,” Salihu added.
