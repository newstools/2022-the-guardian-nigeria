Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State has done it again. After pivoting the affairs of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as Chairman of the Ondo State Governorship Campaign and delivered the party in the South West state in 2016, Lalong’s ideas have again ruled at the just concluded APC presidential primary.  Whatever choice the presidential candidate makes at this stage, will give an indication of his understanding of the nation’s political dynamics and give a glimpse of his vision for the country.
 
The time for the submission of candidates to INEC is nigh and there is no time to waste in seeking what would give an advantage to the APC ticket.
 
Luckily, Governor Lalong is no stranger to Tinubu as the two have worked together for years. When Lalong was chairman of the Conference of Speakers, he coordinated leaders of the state legislature across the country to cooperate and give in their best for governors to run their states smoothly at the time Tinubu was governor of Lagos State.
 
The Plateau Governor is also well known for charting the course for justice and equity to reign and that is why he has been able to restore peace to a state, which before his administration, had been torn by crises and insecurity.
 
On assuming office in 2015, Lalong made sure his cabinet reflected all the ethnic groups in the state and this doused the tension over appointments in the state.
 
The Governor was to go ahead to administer the state with equity and fairness and by being fair to all.  This had sent a strong message across that the Governor is fair minded and not biased against any group and that has helped him to rule the state in peace.
