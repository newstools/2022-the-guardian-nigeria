Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said his government will sustain reforms and programmes to guarantee the influx of investors into the state, ensuring the safety and security of businesses and investments in the state. The governor, who spoke to journalists in Benin City, said his government will sustain efforts to ensure a peaceful and conducive atmosphere for businesses to thrive, making the state a preferred destination for investors in Nigeria. Obaseki further hailed SaroAfrica Group of Companies for the Integrated Agricultural Project, the oil palm initiative and other investments in the state. Obaseki said: “We must thank the SaroAfrica Group for believing in the Edo State government and working with us. The integrated agricultural project is an important project because it uses raw materials from the state and will be employing hundreds of people to grow the cassava and work in the factory to process the output, which is ethanol. “We have the market and the people producing beverages will like to locate close to the sources of raw materials. Those who need carbon dioxide for their plants and products like Coca-Cola have a ready market for their products and the rest of the outputs will be used for piggery feeds. “It is important to create the right political and security environment for more investment to come. This is the reason we have signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the firm and the ongoing road construction in Ologbo is a part of the benefit. This is the basis to engage more with the private sector, as the government doesn’t have much money to fund all projects. This is why we want to attract more investors into the State.”
