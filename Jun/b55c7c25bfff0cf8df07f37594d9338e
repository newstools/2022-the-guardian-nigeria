The family of abducted Kaduna train passengers has urged the public to disregard purported reports of the passengers’ release trending on the social media since Wednesday. The reports purported that an 85-year-old woman and her daughter had been released by their captors and were being attended to in a medical facility. However, a statement, yesterday, by the family signed by Dr. Abdulfatai Jimoh and Dr. Ba’aba Muhammad, described the report as false. The statement reads: “The news circulating in the social media about the purported release of AK9 Abuja-Kaduna train abducted passengers is totally false and the general public should please disregard it.” The state government and security operatives are, however, yet to issue a statement regarding these developments.
