The African Democratic Congress (ADC) governorship aspirant in Lagos State, Akinwunmi Braithwaite, has said that the state is in dire need of a paradigm change in governance. He stressed that the state needed to be rescued from the grip of state-capture actors. Braithwaite, who stated this while declaring to contest the governorship seat of the state, promised to provide the inspirational leadership to deliver the transformational governance that would take Lagos to Olympian heights. He noted that expectations had been dashed with the master plan, which ought to have taken the state to its ‘Eldorado,’ sacrificed on the alter of avarice. He said Lagos had become a shadow of its old glory and was unkempt, insidious, rough and sprawling with shanty towns springing up everywhere. “Our state has become a place where homeless urchins scavenge the streets that are over-run by rubbish, while growing numbers of disenfranchised adults and youths sleep underneath the few bridges that exist. There is so much disorder and chaos, with a looming existential threat posed by those who have nothing to lose, as was demonstrated during the October 2020 riots that followed the #EndSARS Lekki massacre,” he said.  He said that if elected as governor, his approach would be “fundamentally that of caring and partnering with the people to solve the major problems so that there is buy-in from all stakeholders.” He listed infrastructure, economy, education, housing, security, transportation and the youth as key areas of focus for his government.
