The chairman, Atiku Abubakar Town Hall Meetings, Dare ‘Glintstone’ Akinniyi has boasted that the emergence of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar as the Presidential flagbearer of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will mark the end of the All-Progressives Congress (APC) and reposition Nigeria on the path to prosperity.
  
Akinniyi who stated this in a statement yesterday, noted that Atiku’s capability, capacity and ability to lead the country is noteworthy, while commending the delegates for their support. He said: “The emergence of Atiku as the PDP’s flagbearer is the right step in the right direction and I am glad that the delegates got it right. He is the only candidate that is capable of sending APC packing and liberating our country.
 
“Atiku is a unifier and that is what Nigeria needs at this time. Never in the history of our country have we been this polarised and disunited with our unity seriously threatened. So, we actually need a man who has the capacity, and empathy to unite Nigeria and Atiku is that man,” he said.
  
Akinniyi, who is also the Chief Strategist of AtikuKawai Media Group, a media and perception group for the engagement and strategising for the candidacy of Atiku Abubakar stated that among many things, Nigeria needs a blend of steady and experienced hands with the talents, initiative, flexibility, and drive of Nigeria’s talented, vibrant young men and women.
  
“Atiku is aware of the daunting challenges facing Nigeria. The willpower and empathy required to fix Nigeria will need a leader who knows both the historical and contemporary issues of our generations.
  
“Nigeria and indeed Nigerians will be safe in Atiku’s hands and he can halt the slide and redirect our collective resources to build a prosperous country,” he added.
