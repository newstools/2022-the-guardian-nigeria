A team of police, military and vigilante operatives in Niger State have rescued a staff of Guardian Newspapers Limited, Mr Ajibade Alagbe, after spending several hours in their den. Mr. Ajibade Alagbe, who works in The Guardian Newspapers’ Abuja office, was abducted in the early hours of Wednesday from his home located along Kaduna-Abuja road, behind Zuma Rock, Chachi, Tafa Local Government Area of Niger State. Alagbe, who was battered by his abduction, is now in the palace of the village chief in the area. “I was seriously beaten and battered,” Alagbe said. “They took me into a rock.” The gunmen who called his family to demand a ransom payment of N5 million kidnapped Alagbe around 1 am. However, prompt action by Police spokesman, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, saved the day as he activated operational effort towards ensuring that he regains his freedom. The spokesman of Niger State Police Command, who swung into action in the early hours of today, noted that he would brief newsmen later.
