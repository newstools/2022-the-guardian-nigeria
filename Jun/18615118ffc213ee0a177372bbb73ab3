Nigeria’s top two juniors in the Boys’ 16 categories, Seun Ogunsakin and Mubarak Ganiyu, posted easy victories in their second group matches yesterday to make their semifinal placement all but assured. Ogunsakin from Ekiti State took the centre court against Sinclair Okah from Lagos and completely dominated the match to win 9-3. Mubarak also put up an even better performance, showing a high level of concentration and skill to beat Daniel Ibrahim 9-0. In the Girls’ 12, the fight for the top two spots leading to the semifinals featured Lorelay Holzendoff from Benin and Favour Okon-James from Akwa Ibom. Holzendoff, born by a German-Nigerian couple won the one-sided, but very entertaining match 9 – 0. The final group matches will lead to the emergence of today’s semifinalists. The tournament, which is run by the International Tennis Academy, is scheduled to end on Saturday, with a grand finale starting at 1.00 p.m. at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club, Onikan. .
