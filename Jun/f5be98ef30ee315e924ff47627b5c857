Rivers State Government and Dubai’s Department of Economy and Tourism (DET) have intensified efforts towards enhancing the in-bound and out-bound sections of the sector in order to promote domestic tourism. In line with the objective, over 30 companies including DET have arrived at PortHarcourt, the Rivers State capital for a road show aimed at adding value to the Rivers state tourism development. The roadshow cuts across about 30 entities; from medicals to hotels, hospitals among others. Speaking on the move, the Director-General of the Rivers State Tourism Development Agency (RSTDA), Yibo Koko, said there is also the need to promote domestic tourism. “The travel and tour agencies who have an understanding of the incentives from Dubai for out-bound tourism should work with us internally to enable us to do in-bound tourism.” On her part, the Regional Director, International Operations, Dubai Tourism, Stella Fubara, said the roadshow in Nigeria, particularly in Port Harcourt is to equip travel agents and tour operators on what to apply not just on their destinations, but also for in-bound travels to Nigeria. She said: “We are here for our annual road show. Prior to COVID-19, we used to come to Nigeria every year and we moved across at least three cities, usually Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abuja. Now, we have extended it to Kano. The pandemic came and we had to suspend the road shows. This is our first time back since 2020. The reason for the road show is to assist travel agents and tour operatives in Nigeria to improve their business; to know more about destinations that really serve Nigerians. We are here to help them grow their business, the economy as well as improve education.” She continued: “Everything we do is to enable the travel industry in Nigeria to be more knowledgeable. Of course, they take these tools, whether training or road shows and they apply them to their destinations and in-bound travels to Nigeria.
