The management of Dangote Cement Plc has assured block moulders across the country of the availability of the blockbuster brand, stating that efforts have been put in place to ensure the availability of the product. The assurance came in the wake of complaints by blocking moulders from the South-West under the banner of members of the National Association of Block Moulding of Nigeria (NAMBON) that its members experienced difficulty in getting the brand in the market and thus subjecting them to untold hardship in getting the right cement. The Block and Concrete moulders who were on a tour to the Dangote Cement, Ibese plant lamented that they were finding it increasingly difficult to get the block master brand of Dangote Cement which was specifically launched for the block makers. Specifically, the National President of the Association, Prince Adesegun Banjoko who led the South-West branch of the association to the plant said its members were at a loss over why major distributors of the Dangote Cement were reluctant to take block master and urged the management to reverse the trend. As a solution to the problem, the NAMBON President suggested the creation of satellite deports for the distribution of the variant so that the block and concrete moulders would have access to the products easily. In his response, the Ibese Plant Director of Dangote Cement, Azard Nawabuddin said the product would be made available at any time while assuring that the management would look into the problem of scarcity in the market. He said the company has thousands of tonnes of the product and wondered why the block moulders would be complaining of non-availability. National Artisan Coordinator, Dangote Cement, Johnson Olaniyi urged the blockmakers to exercise patience, adding that the firm would look into their complaints and come up with solutions to tackle the problem.
