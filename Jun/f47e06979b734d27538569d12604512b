The Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa has urged lawmakers who lost the All Progressives Congress’ (APC) tickets during party’s primaries to continue to discharge their legislative duties to constituents. Obasa gave the advice at the resumption of the Lagos Assembly plenary yesterday after the APC primary election in the state. Out of the 40-member-Assembly, about 20 members failed to secure party ticket to recontest for their seats in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Obasa advised members that could not clinch the ticket, not to allow the loss to deter them from performing what they were elected for, until June 2023 when the tenure of the 9th assembly would expire. The speaker said even though the party primaries election had come and gone, half of the 40 members were not satisfied with the outcome of the primaries in some constituencies. “Even though the election has come and gone but many of us are not satisfy with the outcome of the election but that is democracy for us. “Some of us that are not lucky enough still have almost a year to serve our people, our constituencies, in this hallowed chamber. “So our primary assignment now is for us to focus on our legislative duty and to ensure that we do our best and we will continue to do it,” he said. Obasa noted that the incoming lawmakers might not be able to fill the gap of the lawmakers that could not return to the Assembly. “It is of great concern to me that having almost half of members leaving is not a good primary outing for the next Assembly.”
 He, however, urged them to continue to discharge their legislative responsibilities because there will always be another day for them to achieve another political ambition.
