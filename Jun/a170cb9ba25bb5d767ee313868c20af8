The tour is named after his new album which features contributions artists like from Davido, Ty Dolla $ign and Lucky Daye. Gold took the stage wearing a silk green-and-purple piece fashioned by British designer Ozwald Boateng, which mirrored his sophisticated and unconventional sound as an artist. “Pami,” one of the first songs of the night, had the audience singing through every note and video, lights, and fireworks transformed the Apollo into a celebration field. The concert also served as a showcase for emerging talent for Gold. Before Gold took the stage, NYC Afrobeat singer Fadi took the stage to perform her new single, “Peace of Mind.” Midway in the show, Gold took a brief intermission to welcome rising star Pheelz, who performed his viral hit “Finesse,” featuring Buju, in what was the singer’s first performance in the United States. Gold returned to the stage afterwards, wearing a new dress and performing a new set of songs, many of which were softer and cooler. As fans rushed to get closer to him, he serenaded the crowd with “One Woman” and wrapped up the night with an extended rendition of his signature song, “Higher”.
