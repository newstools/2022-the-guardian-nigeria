Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has raised the alarm over alleged plan by the Nigerian Army to commence confiscation of local guns in the South East. IPOB revealed that the house-to-house search and seizures would be embarked upon against the innocent citizens of four local councils of Imo State, including Obowu, Achingali in Mbaise, Mbano and Ihite Uboma. The Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, in a statement, yesterday, disclosed that these communities and local councils were surrounded by soldiers and police to start the unlawful action. The group also called on the public, men and women of good conscience across the globe to prevail on Nigerian government and its security agencies to leave Biafra territory alone and face Fulani terrorists, masquerading as herdsmen, who are raping women and girls in the North. The statement reads in part: “We, the global movement and family of IPOB, led by our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, raises the alarm over secret genocide the Nigerian Army and its sisters security agencies wish to embark upon against innocent citizens of Obowu, Achingali in Mbaise, Mbano, Ihite Uboma local councils of Imo. “The information at our disposal indicates that the Nigeria Army and police have been deployed to these communities to embark on house-to-house search to mop up hunters’ guns and personal objects people use for their security, mostly single and double barrel guns, being used for hunting games and for self-defence from dangerous animals and terrorists as the government agencies care less about their safety. “This move further confirms our complaint about the deliberate attempt to wipe Biafrans out, and for Fulani to occupy our ancestral lands. “The Nigerian Army is now camped at Otoko police station, from where they will perfect their plans with the conscripted local vigilantes and other bought overs, who we call “ndi osuimi” (traitors and saboteurs in our midst), and then move house to house for collection of farmers dane-guns made for self-defence. “Meanwhile, Fulani terrorists, herdsmen, kidnappers and bandits freely move with not just AK-47, AK-49, but now with Travor “Tar-21,” which only Nigerian government is licensed and authorised to use.”
