 Beyonce in Black Is King Visuals Beyoncé has made a well-timed return with “Break My Soul” track six off her forthcoming album “Renaissance.” The Grammy award-winning singer released the track hours before its scheduled midnight release. The single produced by The-Dream features Queen B herself, her husband Jay-Z, Big Freedia, BlaqNmild, and original writers of “Show Me Love”; Fred Mc Farlane and Allen George as writers. “Break My Soul” samples Robin S’s 90’s house hit “Show Me Love.” Beyoncé makes her return clear, singing, “Bey is back and I’m sleeping real good at night.” Beyoncé announced the single’s release in an unusual way, changing the bio of each of her social media platforms to announce its release time. The scheduled Tuesday release of her single was a surprise to many as the singer only recently announced the proposed release date for “Renaissance.” While she’s yet to reveal more details about the album asides from its July 29 release date, there are high hopes that she will reel out more surprises in the forthcoming weeks.
