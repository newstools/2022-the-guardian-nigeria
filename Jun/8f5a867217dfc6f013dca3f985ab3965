Imo State Government has debunked the allegation by some media outlets that Governor Hope Uzodimma advocated a Muslim-Muslim ticket for the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, stated, yesterday, that at no time did the governor canvass such a position. He said Uzodimma was rather emphatic that religion was not mentioned as a factor in the constitution for the election of a president or his deputy, adding that what the country needed was a good government that would accommodate the religious and ethnic diversity of the country. “How can this position amount to advocating for Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket?” the commissioner asked. He regretted that mischief-makers twisted the answer given by Uzodimma to
State House correspondents.
