On market outlook, Cordros Capital said: “We expect alpha-seeking investors to continue to seek trading opportunities in companies that delivered impressive earnings during the Q1-22 earnings season despite the expectation of an uptick in yields in the FI market. “However, we think the absence of a near-term catalyst will likely skew overall market sentiments to the negative side, particularly as the political space gets heated up. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Investdata Consulting Limited said: “We expect profit-taking after the recent bargain hunting that pushed the market up amid the continued portfolio repositioning ahead of economic data, and the interim dividend season, while audited accounts of March year-end companies are expected to hit the market. “We also note the flow of funds into the fixed income segment on the rate hike by the CBN, as sector rotation persists and players digest the macro-economic data and Q1 corporate earnings release.” A total of 2,110 units of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) valued at N168.1 were traded this week in 21 deals compared with a total of 43,648 units valued at N987,351.25 transacted last week in 24 deals.
