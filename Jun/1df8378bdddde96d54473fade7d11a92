The absence of the defendant’s counsel, Abayomi Omotubora, yesterday, stalled the scheduled trial of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) driver,  Andrew Ominnikoron, accused of sexual assault and murder of a 22-year-old fashion designer, Oluwabamise Ayanwole.
   
Justice Shrrifat Sonaike of a Lagos High Court sitting in Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) had fixed yesterday for continuation of trial, but the matter could not go ahead as a result of inability of the defendant’s counsel to attend proceeding due to illness.
  
The case was also stalled on June 1, due to security issue, regarding the ban on operation of commercial motorcycle popularly known as Okada, as the suspect was not brought to court by officers of the Nigerian Correctional Services.
