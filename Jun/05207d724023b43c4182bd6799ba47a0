Renowned for his signature tagline, ‘Wi Wi Wi Willis Give Dem’, Yung Willis has always prioritised giving back value, which is one of the inspirations behind his tagline. Having gained enough experience working with various artistes while creating unique sounds, the Abuja-native now feels ready to ‘give back’ from that experience base through his newly launched record company, Royals Music Records. Sharing his joy with Guardian Music, he says, “today marks the beginning of something groundbreaking for the future of Talents discovery, Artistes, Music Producers, Sound Engineers, Song Writers and Creatives or Entertainment Professionals generally. “One person that always inspired me is Don Jazzy, with how he has shown through Mavin that Nigerians can structure that music at a global standard. Kanye West has also always been a big inspiration for me, both musically and entrepreneurially.” He continues, “I’m still that young boy from Abuja, still learning and trying to navigate the entertainment industry but strongly believes in structure and I’m passionate about getting It right. I believe that it’s time for me to start small. With the launch of Royals Music, I can take the next phase in the evolution of my art and brand and by God’s grace, I can still Give Back to the creative society that has helped me thrive over the last few years. The launch comes just before the release of his debut single fittingly titled Givin Dem which is the first single off his upcoming album LOTP (Life of The Party). For this album, Yung Willis has partnered with the Mr Eazi powered international label, emPawa Africa.
