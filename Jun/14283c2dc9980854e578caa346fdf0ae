The scheduled Tuesday release of her single comes as a surprise to many as the singer only recently announced the proposed release date for “Renaissance.” After teasing the internet with days of cryptic hints, Beyoncé on Thursday announced the arrival of her long-awaited seventh studio album “Renaissance,” her first since 2016’s “Lemonade.” Beyoncé sparked suspicion among music and social media followers after she deleted multiple social profile pictures in early June. Overnight the streaming service Tidal, a platform formerly owned by Beyonce’s husband Jay-Z, announced on Twitter the album would land July 29, with rival companies Spotify and Apple Music tweeting the same news minutes later. Thursday’s news was accompanied by the announcement of a cover shoot with British Vogue that presents Queen B as a retro-futuristic glam club kid. The July 2022 issue is slated to hit newsstands on June 21. “Soaring vocals and fierce beats combine and in a split second I’m transported back to the clubs of my youth,” wrote Edward Enninful, the editor-in-chief of British Vogue who spent time at Beyonce’s Los Angeles home for the story, of the star’s new music. “I want to get up and start throwing moves. It’s music I love to my core.” “Music that makes you rise, that turns your mind to cultures and subcultures, to our people past and present, music that will unite so many on the dance floor, music that touches your soul.”
