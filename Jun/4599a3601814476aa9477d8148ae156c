When it comes to highlighting a clothing staple of the fashion industry, the blazer is without a doubt the winner, owing to its versatility and ability to have a “Chic” effect on its wearer. Be it casual or formal, blazers can be worn for a variety of occasions and are often a good way to elevate the styling of an entire outfit.
In honor of one of fashion’s greatest inventions, here are some ways to wear a blazer. Tshirt, jeans and blazer Photo ChiomaGoodHair Tshirt, jeans and blazer Photo Melody Jacob 2. Blazers and turtlenecks
It’s difficult to go wrong with turtlenecks, so wearing one with a blazer is clearly not a fashion faux pas. While you want to exude a classy London elegant lady vibe while wearing this outfit, keep in mind that choosing the right color and fabric is essential for nailing this look.
Rather than staying safe, you could opt for a print blazer and a neutral turtleneck with trousers. Try not to go overboard with fabric or colour choices, and always make sure that your clothing items are cohesive. Turtle neck and blazer Photo Pinterest 3. Blazers and gowns
Want to up your blazer game and become the next fashion trailblazer? Then try layering a blazer over a below the knee length gown. Gone are the days when blazers were worn over shirts or tops, now gowns are becoming part of the conversation.
This combination not only puts a new spin on the blazer look, but it’s also fun and versatile, suitable for both a night out with the girls or taking that jaw dropping instagram picture. Lori Harvey Photo Instagram 4. Blazers and accessories
Sometimes just wearing a blazer isn’t enough; you need to add details like brooches, pocket squares, and scarves to make it stand out. These accessories will set your blazer apart from the hundreds of others on the market. ChimoaGoodHair Photo Instagram Sharon Ooja Photo Instagram
