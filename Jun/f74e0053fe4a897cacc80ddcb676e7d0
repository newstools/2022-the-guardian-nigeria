Combined forces made up of the Military, Department of State Security (DSS) and Nigerian Police, yesterday, killed three suspected members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN) in Ebonyi State after neutralising their hideout. The Guardian gathered that the forces, after a tip off, traced the hoodlums to their camp at Onicha Local Council of the state, where they engaged in a gun battle in which three were killed and many injured. In a statement in Abakaliki, the police Public Relations Officer, SP Chris Anyanwu, said that the hoodlum, on Monday night, killed an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), who was on a patrol with others and made their way to Onicha Local Council, where the security agencies later invaded. The statement said: “A joint operation of the Ebonyi State Police Command Tactical Operation Teams, the Military and DSS embarked on an operation this day, 31/05/2022 to dislodge criminals hibernating at the main camp of ESN within Onicha Isu Local Council of Ebonyi. “This was sequel to an attack on a police patrol team yesterday, during which a police officer was murdered by the hoodlums.”
