The two legendary political warhorses, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former Lagos State governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, have begun their famed battle for the 2023 Presidential poll with the search for their running mates. And, it seems that the way and manner they scaled that first hurdle would determine how far they would go in convincing Nigerians that they possess the magic wand to clean the Augean stable of leadership inertia hobbling the country.  Nnamani may also not have the resources a sitting governor could give to support a huge presidential campaign.
One other former governor being mentioned in the hunt for Atiku’s running mate is the former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, who, apart from having served as Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, was Atiku’s former aide. However, Ihedioha, who is a close-confidant and ally of Sokoto State governor, Alhaji Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, is however being limited by his short span as governor and low-level political influence in Imo State, which has an APC incumbent governor.
  
From South-south, which boasts of five incumbent PDP governors, only three are in their final term, namely, Udom Emmanuel, (Akwa Ibom); Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta) and Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, (Rivers State). Emmanuel and Wike contested against Atiku for the PDP ticket during the primaries. It was gathered that Okowa did not purchase the presidential nomination, perhaps to be relevant at a time like this.
  
While the forum of incumbent governors is making strong case to produce Atiku’s running mate, it was gathered that emergence of Tinubu and the compelling need to select a value-added deputy has narrowed the search to two serving governors, Wike and Okowa. A little bit of combat readiness makes the case of Wike more appealing. Further, retired military generals, who orchestrated Tambuwal’s withdrawal to pave way for Atiku’s emergence are said to be in the loop also. Their views are being sought as well.
