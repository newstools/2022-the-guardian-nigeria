…says country needs commander-in-chief, not sympathiser-in-chief National President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Francis Wale Oke, has condemned continued killing of Christians in the country, even as he urged members to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of the 2023 general elections. Addressing journalists in Lagos, yesterday, he noted that PFN leadership have declared June 26 as PVC Sunday, where members would be allowed entry into the church if they could produce their voter cards. He said: “We are going to pray on that day. We are mobilising and voting massively and our vote must count.” According to him, Nigeria needs a leader that will promote equity, justice and fairness, a leader that will provide education, employment, infrastructure and create jobs. “We want a leader that will end mindless killings in the country. We are giving equal opportunities to all political parties. We are not going to be partisan; we must work to make this nation better. “We enjoin all Christians that prayer is still a potent weapon. We must turn to God so that God can step into Nigeria’s case,” he said. He said the country needs a Commander-in-Chief and not a Sympathiser-in-Chief, a leader that will deal decisively with the challenges. On registration of Christians, he said CAN was collaborating with INEC to use churches as registration centres.”
IN Calabar, the Chairman of PFN, Cross River State chapter, Dr. Lawrence Ekwok, told newsmen, yesterday, that all members of Pentecostal churches would attend service on June 26 with their PVCs. The church leadership, he added, would also ensure that statistics of those with their voter’s cards were taken and forwarded to the state chairmen, who will, in turn, forward the statistics to the national office. Ekwok added that the PFN had constituted a national committee that would advise the leadership of the fellowship on candidates to vote for in the forthcoming 2023 elections.
