Three members of senior national men’s team, Isaac Okpe, Sylvester Okpe and Sesan Adedeji are in South Africa for a player placement programme sponsored by the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF) and facilitated by the International Cricket Council (ICC), Africa. The three players are supposed to be part of some select games while undergoing training to upskill their playing capacity. Sylvester Okpe is the national men’s captain, while Isaac, his brother, is the team’s all-rounder. Sesan Adedeji has eked out some of the best performances in the team, including being named man-of-the-series at the Tri-nation tournament in Uganda last year. NCF General Manager, Emeka Igwilo, said the session will help the country achieve some level of honing in the skill of some key players. These, he believes, will be useful when the team assembles for national assignments. “The team is expected to be featured in an invitational in Tanzania and I believe this exposure will be of great benefit to the team as a whole. They would be there for a whole month and expected to join the rest of the team on June 29,” he said. The national team is billed to participate in the Afro Gulf T20 international cup competition holding in Tanzania from July 1 to 14.
