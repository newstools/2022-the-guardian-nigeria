The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has rehabilitated over 11,000 drug users, arrested 10 drug barons and convicted one of them between 2021 and 2022.  “This will also enable those afraid of stigmitisation to be able to seek help without necessarily being seen or identified by anyone. “Even as we rev up our drug supply reduction offensive, it is certain that we are not relenting on getting help to those suffering from drug use disorder.”
   
Marwa noted that while the world has been grappling with the illicit drugs conundrum for over three decades, changing dynamics in present decade have forced a paradigm shift and re-adjusted perspectives that allow for drug narratives to be seen in multidimensional ways.
 
“That has brought to the fore the imperative of looking at the drug problem through the lens of public health and also tackling such a broader social problem rather than through the conventional, narrow, criminal matter approach.
   
“It has, therefore, also become prudent to initiate mechanisms and measures that are proactively extenuating. In our case, the National Drug Control Master Plan (NDCMP) 2021-2025, launched last November, has incorporated components that tend to the health concerns of drug abuse,” he added.
