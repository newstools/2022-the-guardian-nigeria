The Seaports Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria (STOAN) has expressed the willingness of its members to increase their investments at the ports.  “We are ready to sit with you and your team to look at the legal and financial framework under which we can make this investment to continue to keep Lagos ports competitive,” Russo, who is also the Managing Director of PTML Terminal, said. He said while the new port being constructed in Lekki is “an opportunity for Lagos”, the ports in Apapa and Tin Can Island should not be neglected as they would still be very relevant.
   
“So, it is very necessary to allow the investment and infrastructure to make the port stay relevant and competitive. I want to make mention concession renewal. This has been the concern of our members. We have been negotiating for some time on this matter. And it is worthy of note to say that this investment will require a very long time to be recovered. Our members need commitment. So, I believe that from all our members, there is the intention to continue to invest but of course, they want to finalize as soon as possible, the issue of concession renewal,” he said. 
 
“Congestion is another challenge being faced by our members. Currently in the port, you may not see any because of the economic condition our country is facing at the moment and the general crisis all over the world and especially the lockdown in China, which is affecting the cargos coming to Lagos.
