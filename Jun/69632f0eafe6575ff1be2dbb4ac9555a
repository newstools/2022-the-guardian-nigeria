Some leaders of thought in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State have commended what they described as “free and fair exercise” that produced Obong Akan Udofia, as the governorship candidate of the party in the 2023 general election. Obong Udofia emerged winner of the APC governorship primary held at the secretariat of the party, Etuk Obok, Uyo, the state capital. Udofia scored 1,227 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Senator Ita Enang, a former senior special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari, who had 34 votes. One of the leaders of the party in the state, Prof. Chief Okon Etim, in a statement, described the exercise as the triumph of democracy. He said the primary was particularly exhilarating because it featured quality candidates and eventually threw up a technocrat par excellence, who would give the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), a run for its money and liberate the people from decades of cosmetic leadership. Speaking in the same vein, one of the aspirants, Prof. Chris Ekong and former Chairman, Ibiono Ibom Council, Mr. Akan Okon, said that with Udofia’s victory, a new lease of life is now guaranteed for the long-suffering people of Akwa Ibom State. They noted that the ruling party has become jittery because the APC has put its house in order. According to them, the people of the state have turned to the APC as the platform to achieve the much-desired change that they had clamoured for, for decades.
