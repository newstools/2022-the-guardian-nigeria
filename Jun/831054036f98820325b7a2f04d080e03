And as tensions heighten, the entertainment industry is definitely doing its own part of keeping us entertained. Here’s a quick rundown on some trending stories that made the news in the past week. Beyonce is Coming!
Queen Bee announced her return with her seventh studio album, “Renaissance”, on Thursday. Beyonce had taken a lead spot on trending topics worldwide after she deleted the profile pictures off her social media accounts and removed all content from her website. The new album is scheduled for a July 29 release, but that’s not holding Beyonce back as she is selling merch without showing anyone what it looks like. Anyway, in conclusion, Beyonce is coming, so get ready to leave your man Burna Boy Musicians in the mud
Last week, Burna Boy and Wande Coal were on everyone’s lips, not for anything good. Firstly news broke that Burna Boy’s police escorts had shot at two people after one of them refused the singer’s advances toward his wife. Apparently, the singer’s police escort had shot at the group of people partying and hit one on the thigh and the other on the head. Even worse, witnesses say the singer came into the club with three girls, and while we cannot speak on what possessed them to shoot at anyone, one thing we can guess is Burna Boy isn’t used to being turned down. The only thing he’s since said about the issue was a tweet about social media accusing him of doing random things. As if that wasn’t enough trauma from a Nigerian artist, Wande Coal and his crew were accused of beating up someone else. And while he’s yet to come out and say something, we need these musicians to calm down, please. Chris Brown,PHOTO: (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) Chris Brown and Wizkid again!
The next couple of months will be packed with great music, and we’re here for it. “Breezy” and Wizkid are definitely releasing a new sound off Chris Brown’s self-titled album. Chris Brown shared a snippet of him dancing to the new sound, and it didn’t take long for everyone to tag it the sound of the summer. The list of things to do for summer 2022 now includes jamming to some Chris Brown and Wizkid.  Mercy Aigbe Mercy Aigbe again!
We watched Mercy Aigbe and businesswoman Lara Olukotun fight dirty in viral videos. Apparently, both of them took their online differences to real life and hashed it out in some violence.
And while we don’t support violence, it made the trend tables, and we cannot ignore it.
Mercy Aigbe accused Lara of bullying her online since she announced her marriage to Adeoti Kazim back in January.
On the other hand, Lara warned the actress to desist from mentioning her name for whatever reasons.
And so it seems both parties are not ready to settle, at least not yet.
