Warns Nigeria not ripe for Muslim-Muslim ticket
Methodist Church Nigeria has urged Christians to pray for worthy leaders to emerge as winners in 2023 general elections. This was contained in the communiqué of the 28th yearly synod of the church,  signed by Bishop, Diocese of Lagos Mainland, Rt. Revd. (Dr.) Obafemi Adeleye and Lay President, Olusola Adu. Besides, citizens were also admonished not to be financially-induced by politicians, saying that such will sway away their votes and conscience and deprive the nation of the true dividends of democracy. The church urged the Federal Government to provide solutions to the myriad of challenges faced by citizens in the name of hunger, hyper-inflation and insecurity. It also reiterated the need for the establishment of six geo-political regional governments. MEANWHILE, Methodist Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Ayo Olawuyi, yesterday warned political parties against fielding a Muslim-Muslim candidates for the 2023 presidential election, saying that Nigeria is not ripe for such combination even though it’s a secular country. The cleric, who stated this at a media briefing on the line up of activities of the 60th anniversary of the Diocese of Lagos, held at Wesley Chapel, noted that any party that presents a Muslim-Muslim ticket has a hidden agenda, urging Christians to be involved in governance. Olawuyi, who said that governance should not be seen as peculiar to a particular tribe, region or religion, described as worrisome and disheartening that the body language and performance of the Federal Government in tackling insecurity suggest either inability or no interest of doing so. He, therefore, urged all Christians to rise up to the clarion call of the hour, which is the safety of the nation, to contest for all elective positions in the country’s political system.
