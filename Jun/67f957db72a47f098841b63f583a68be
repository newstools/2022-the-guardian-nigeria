Two Nigerians have been arrested by UK police for conspiring to traffic a child to Nigeria for the purpose of ‘harvesting’ the organs. Metropolitan police in a statement said that Beatrice Nwanneka Ekweremadu and Ike Ekweremadu, who are 55 and 60 years old respectively have been remanded in custody and will appear at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court. The police confirmed that the man and a woman have been charged with conspiring to arrange to bring a child to the UK to harvest organs in their home country, Nigeria.

Police, however, said the child has been safeguarded but did not disclose the gender or the age of the child or the location of the arrests. The report suggests that it is likely the suspects were arrested at Heathrow Airport since they are appearing in a court in Uxbridge. A police investigation was launched after detectives were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery legislation in May 2022, the force said. In September 2021, UK police appealed for information twenty years after the severed body of a Nigerian boy was found. The young boy is believed to have been killed as a human sacrifice was found in the River Thames, London. The boy’s headless and limbless body was found in the London part of the river clad in orange shorts on September 21, 2001. The police believed the boy came from Nigeria. On Tuesday, London’s Metropolitan Police asked those who may have knowledge of the case to be “bold”, suggesting they may no longer be bound by former allegiances. “It is incredibly sad and frustrating that Adam’s murder remains unsolved,” said Detective Chief Inspector Kate Kieran. “This young boy has not and will not be forgotten. He deserved better and we will not give up on him.”
