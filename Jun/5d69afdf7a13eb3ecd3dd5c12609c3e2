Robbie Keane is gob-smacked that the Premier League’s “best player” Heung-Min Son was left out of the PFA Team of the Year. Son, 29, shared the Golden Boot with Mohamed Salah after finding the back of the net 23 times for Tottenham. But the South Korean ace was surprisingly left out of the side, which was voted for by fellow players. And former Spurs and Republic of Ireland striker Keane is furious the forward has once again been overlooked.

He’s scored 23 goals, didn’t score any penalties — his assists, his energy in the game, and he’s also a f***ing good lad. He’s a really, really good person off the field. But forget about off the field, he’s a top, top player. How have the players not picked him?
I am genuinely shocked. Anyone who picks that needs to go back again and do it. Liverpool has been reported to have an interest in Son in recent weeks, which is not a surprise to Keane. He added: “Liverpool, Barcelona Real Madrid — I’m not surprised. Why wouldn’t you be?” Though angry at the players’ vote, Keane is predicting a bright future for Spurs under serial winner, Antonio Conte. The Italian has won league titles at Juventus, Chelsea and Inter Milan but Irishman, Keane knows adding another may well be a stretch too far with Manchester City and Liverpool looking so strong.
