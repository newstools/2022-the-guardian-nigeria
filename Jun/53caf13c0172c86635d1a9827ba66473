You guys area blessing and an inspiration. “And of course a huge shout out to other self-proclaimed Nollywood filmmakers and critics, who have produced numerous movies in their heads, won awards with them and even climbed the stage to make speeches, but are yet to produce any in reality. We see you, we are rooting for you! A win for one is a win for all. Directed by Bunmi Ajekaiye and Produced by Abimbola Craig, Glamour Girls explores the fast life of a group of promiscuous women, living a life of glitz and glamour, and willing to do whatever it takes to maintain the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed. The unrestricted access to wealth and privilege that once ruled their universe soon becomes secondary, following a murder and assumed theft that threatens their lives, both home and abroad. The film features Nse-Ikpe Etim, Sharon Ooja Egwurube, Toke Makinwa, Joselyn Dumas and Segilola Ogidan, among others.
