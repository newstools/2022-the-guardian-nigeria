With the massive potential in the hide and skin manufacturing sector and the impact on Nigeria’s economy, the Lagos Leather Fair (LLF) has continued to drive growth in the sector. The event is also educating and creating maximum visibility for leading players in the leather sector in Nigeria and Africa.
  
At this year’s edition, which was held at the Federal Palace Hotel Lagos recently, stakeholders across Sub-Saharan Africa discussed how to change the narrative of the industry across the continent.
  
Those who attended the two-day event include the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Adeniyi Adebayo; former Governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke and officials of other federal ministries, Bank of Industry, trade bodies and financial institutions. Also in attendance are leather designers as well as local and international investors.  For five years now, we have constantly provided a platform for leather and lifestyle enthusiasts and industry players to come together, to enhance visibility for the industry, whilst also championing conversations on how to move the industry forward. And this year, despite the impact of the pandemic, we have seen that industry players have continued to hone their craftsmanship, their skills, and their innovation to drive the shift that we need to make the industry’s potential a reality. We are glad to have created this platform to showcase some of the country’s wins and economic prosperity. Some exhibitors who have been with us from the very first edition have now metamorphosed into an international phenomenon, driving a positive Made-in-Nigeria narrative on the global stage.”
