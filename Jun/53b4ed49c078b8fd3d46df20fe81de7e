The movie, upon release, was met by heavy criticism and praises, causing mixed reviews from viewers to push the release to the top trending topic in Nigeria across all major social media platforms. In the first 24 hours following its release, Glamour Girls was the Number 1 movie on Netflix in Nigeria, reaching the Top 10 spot in 20 other countries worldwide including the United Arab Emirates, Portugal, South Africa, Kenya, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Qatar, Belgium, Panama and Nicaragua among others in the two days that followed. With the movie director, producer, writer, associate producers, and story editors being all-female, not only were the major stakeholders in the Glamour Girls crew female, 90% of the entire production was female-led and facilitated. Speaking on social media via his Instagram account, Executive Producer Charles Okpaleke, popularly known as Charles of Play stated the importance of exploring his intellectual property rights to Glamour Girls in a way that promotes gender equilibrium and encourages female leadership at every stage of Nigerian movie production. Directed by Bunmi Ajekaiye and Produced by Abimbola Craig, Glamour Girls explores the fast life of a group of promiscuous women, living a life of glitz and glamour, and willing to do whatever it takes to maintain the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed. The unrestricted access to wealth and privilege that once ruled their universe soon becomes secondary, following a murder and assumed theft that threatens their lives, both home and abroad. The movie features Nse-Ikpe Etim, Sharon Ooja Egwurube, Toke Makinwa, Joselyn Dumas and Segilola Ogidan, among others.
