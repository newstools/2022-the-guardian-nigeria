AIU extended the ban by a year after Okagbare was found to have committed additional anti-doping rule violations.

Those are the rules and we will not compromise on integrity.” She was charged for her latest anti-doping rule violation on June 10, 2022. With the ban extension, Nigeria’s 4×100m relay team lose their qualification spot for the World Athletics Championships in Oregon, United States. Okagbare, a 2008 Olympic long jump silver medallist, was a medal contender for the women’s 100m in Tokyo last year and won her heat in 11.05 seconds. But she was ruled out of the semi-finals after the AIU said she had tested positive for a human growth hormone following an out-of-competition test on 19 July.
