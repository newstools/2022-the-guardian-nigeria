 Comedy Central’s The Daily Show with Trevor Noah “Stand Strong” singer Davido joined TV host Trevor Noah on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” yesterday.   In his interview, the singer spoke about raising N200M in 72 hours after sharing his account details on social media during his birthday in 2021. Speaking with Trevor Noah, he noted that he had to reach out to everyone he had helped/worked with in the past. He said, “I started calling famous people…I was like c’mon you know I made a hit song for you last year. I was like everybody that I have helped in one way or the other, that’s why this tour is called we rise by lifting others. I was scared it came up to $600,000 and at this point, I’m like can I keep this?” However, due to everything going on in the world, he decided to give it out. “We know that so much is going on around the world and I was like I can’t be that insensitive and I spoke to my dad who is my mentor and he said ‘you know you can’t keep that money.’ A lot of people were like no keep it, you’ve done so much for the community.” “We decided to donate all $600,000 to orphanages around Nigeria.” “I woke up the next day, reflecting on my whole life and how God has blessed me. So we decided to donate all $600,000 to orphanages across the country. Just for accountability, it took months to disburse because we had to know which orphanage is real,” he explained. “Then I started getting tweets like ‘this dude kept the money.’ Because after that, I bought two more cars. I bought a Lamborghini…that was just my money, though.” The duo also discussed Davido’s new single titled “Stand Strong,” his U.S. summer tour “We Rise by Lifting Others,” which highlights African art and culture through song, dance, food, and fashion. Raising $600,000 The singer, who turned 29 on November 21, 2021, took to his Instagram story to ask colleagues to each send him a million naira. In a video posted on Instagram, which many took to be a joke, Davido called on those he had helped in the music industry to each send him money. He said, “We rise by lifting others abi? Me I don dey rise dey lifting others for the past 100 years. So I want to know who my friends are. All of my friends one one million Naira. They said we are 30BG. If you don’t send your own. You out of here. You are gone (sic).” He received money from other celebrities, including BB Naija’s Nengi, Perruzi, Teni, Adekunle Gold, Mr Eazi, Zlatan, Cubana Chief Priest, and Chike to mention a few. He also received money from Oyo State House of Representatives member Akin Alabi, businessman and socialite, Emeka Okonkwo aka E-money, and Obinna Iyiegbu aka Obi Cubana. In the spirit of accountability, Davido updated his Instagram stories regularly throughout the fundraising period with screenshots of transactions and individually thanking everyone who sent him money. After fundraising, the singer took to social media to reveal that all he received 200M from fans and friends and added 50million, all of which would be donated to orphanages around Nigeria. To achieve this, he had constituted a 5-man committee to take care of the logistics. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1780390 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="1600" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569.jpeg 1080w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569-478x598.jpeg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569-922x1152.jpeg 922w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569-192x240.jpeg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569-384x480.jpeg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif-2-0f90171569-480x600.jpeg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> On February 15, 2022, the music star thanked the committee that was set up to disburse the funds in a statement shared to his social media. “Since its inauguration, the members of the committee have worked tirelessly to ensure that they collate the names and information of the documented and verified orphanages,” part of the statement read. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1780392 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="2276" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e.jpeg 1152w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-336x598.jpeg 336w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-648x1152.jpeg 648w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-864x1536.jpeg 864w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-135x240.jpeg 135w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-270x480.jpeg 270w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/FLqaDtLWUAM5F5e-338x600.jpeg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Watch the full interview HERE:
