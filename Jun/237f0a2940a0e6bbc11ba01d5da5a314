The Oyo State Government on Friday presented 9, 227 letters of promotion to primary school teachers on Grade level 13 to 15 in the state. This was revealed by the Executive Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board, Dr. Nureni Aderemi Adeniran during the symbolic presentation of 2017 to 2020 letters to 7, 4 60 teachers. He said the pending promotion letters are in fulfillment of Governor Seyi Makinde’s promises to teachers in the state. Dr. Adeniran noted that the category of teachers who received their letters of promotion were placed on a six years waiting period by the previous administrations, adding that this policy had affected the morale of teachers in Public Primary Schools, as their counterparts in the secondary schools were not affected by the policy. “I am pleased to be here this morning at the official presentation of promotion letters to our teachers from the grade level 13 to 15. You are all aware that a similar programme was held in October, 2021 for teachers and non-teaching staff,” he said. Adeniran appreciated the Executive Governor of the state, Engineer Seyi Makinde for his love for teachers, which was demonstrated by the approval granted, that six years waiting period be reverted with immediate effect. “This by implication means that all teachers affected are going to enjoy their promotions with a month’s arrears and this takes financial effect from the month of June, 2022,” he said.
