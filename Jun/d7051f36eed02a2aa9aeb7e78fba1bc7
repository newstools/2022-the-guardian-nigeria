Defending champion of EEAST, Dokun Esan, has also expressed his desire to fight off challengers to retain his title this year. The winner is expected to pocket N250,000 and consolation prizes for participants. The tournament is supported by Cinq SAA, AfricanSports, BizzyBody, MGi, Lekki Scrabble Club,  Leonse International, SAOR and Eko Hotel & Suites. Meanwhile, initiator of the tournament,  Emmanuel Egbele, said all strategic plans have been activated by the committee to deliver the “Sophomore Edition” as one of the best scrabble experience in the present era.

The EEAST will be used as a rating- points garnering tournament for the MGi Scrabble Grand Slam Championship slated for October this year.
