• Party primaries set new exchange rate ceilings
• BDC operators run out of supply as politicians warehouse dollar
• Fear of higher political risk spreads across markets
• CBN’s rigidity stalling capital inflow, says Yusuf The currency market may have defied experts’ prediction that the informal segment would witness a momentary glut of dollars as political party delegates, who reportedly made a killing with hard currencies, would start offloading their foreign exchange holding after the crucial political events.  Reports of ‘dollar rain’ began to be widespread a week ago after the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) conducted its presidential primary in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Checks in the market showed that illiquidity has worsened in the past week with the naira selling between N600 and N610 to a dollar. The dollar peaked during PDP’s convention, trading for as much as N610/$ but retraced to about N602/$ last week.  Thus, private enterprises, which need FX for businesses are starving as there is no supply anywhere. A textile trader in Lagos told our correspondent she put an “urgent business on hold since last week and had to cancel my trip because I cannot get dollar anywhere. “When I mentioned to the ‘aboki’ that has been supplying me dollars for over seven years that I needed $25,000, he just told me to forget it, that he can’t raise it even if he combs the whole of Lagos,” she said. Former director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce (LCCI) and pro-market crusader, Dr. Muda Yusuf, warned that private sector operators would be worse off in the coming days as they cannot match the “war chest” of politicians who are now major competitors in the currency market. He added that the trend portends danger for the economy. Yusuf, who spoke on a television programme, expressed concern about the widening gap between the official and parallel market rate, saying it is a major disincentive to foreign capital flow.
  
Last quarter, the country attracted a total of $1.57 billion. On year-on-year (YoY) analysis, the figure slumped by 17.46 per cent while the quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) performance was even worse at 28.09 per cent.
  
A businessman and presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Dr. Tope Fasua, put the culture of dollarisation of the political space and general dollarisation of the society in the same basket. He said: “It is a pointer to one very important issue in our time. Politicians and our leaders are the ones who have no confidence in our currency. They say to destroy a country, the first thing you have to do is to destroy its currency.
  
“So, we have actively destroyed our currency, and leaders after leaders have shown that they have no interest in the currency and the country. Every governor, council chairman, councilor, including their children, only spend dollars,” Fasua, who is also an economist, said. He noted that the continuous demand for dollar is a major cause of naira depreciation, alleging that the elite are not interested in building a stronger naira.
  
Ken Ife, a professor of economics, said those who are hoarding hard currencies, including the delegates, would start offloading once it is obvious the exchange rate is not going beyond N610/$.
  
“It is psychological. They want a better bargain, which is the reason they are hoarding FX. At best they will observe for one to two weeks, once it is obvious the exchange rate has hit the roof, they will start selling off what they have,” the economist said.
  
Ife said the current panic is unnecessary as dollarisation of the political process is good for the informal segment. He agreed that the process is putting “so much pressure on the demand” but noted that it is a circle that accommodates both demand and supply. Besides, he argued that the informal sector constitutes only seven per cent of the FX market, while the official supply still holds 93 per cent. He, thus, wondered why the entire country would be extremely anxious when manufacturers and others who need FX for genuine businesses have an option of the official window.
  
Sources in the financial system said much of the hard currencies being distributed by politicians were not sourced locally. “A large chunk of it is from overseas. A lot of banks are party to the transfer of the money, much of which is under-the-table deals.
 
“When people talk about mopping of the market, they are talking about a very small portion of the amount being spent. A portion of it comes from overseas while another part was pulled out of storage tanks and all manner of places,” the source informed.  The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, had faulted calls for clean floating of the exchange rate, saying the rate will spiral out of control. He said that Nigeria’s manufacturing sector was not mature for such experimentation. But the controversy over exchange rate harmonisation will certainly continue. For instance, Nigeria’s frontline human rights activist and lawyer, Femi Falana, recently wrote to the apex bank requesting information on abolition of multiple exchange rates. The letter dated May 24 and obtained by The Guardian read: “While speaking at a virtual Investors Conference with the Federal Government of Nigeria organised by CitiBank on June 23, 2020, Mr. Emefiele disclosed that the various exchange rates would be unified around the I & E Window (NAFEX) exchange rate. “Furthermore, he dismissed activities in the parallel market as an illegal business, adding that people patronising the market are doing dealings that are not recognised by authorities. The Minister of Finance and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, confirmed the CBN plan to unify the exchange rates in the country. “Given the foregoing, we hereby request you to furnish us with information on the date fixed by the CBN Board to end multiple exchange rates regime and unify the rates in the country. “As this request is made under the Freedom of Information Act 2011, you are required to furnish me with the requested information not later than seven days upon the receipt of this letter.” Checks, yesterday, revealed that the demand is yet to be met after expiration of the ultimatum. MEANWHILE, the CBN may be under intense pressure to protect the naira against the dollar, as the foreign reserves continue to nosedive. May 2022 witnessed one of the steepest falls in the reserves in recent months. The reserves stood at $39.58 billion at the close of April but dropped to $38.48 billion. Effectively, Nigeria lost about $1.1 billion of its reserves in a single month.
  
Bismarck Rewane, an economist, had earlier in the year warned that the reserves might tumble to $32 billion later in the year amid continued pressure on the domestic currency. This may not be unconnected to the dollarisation of the political process, which continues till after the general elections in February next year. There are also fears that each time the official exchange rate is devalued, which could happen if the pressure continues, the parallel market rates will adjust upward automatically. The CBN injected $3.36 billion into the FX market in two months as part of efforts to ensure the stability of the naira, it was gathered. Figures obtained from CBN’s January monthly report on ‘Foreign Exchange Market Developments’ showed that $1.71 billion and $1.65 billion were injected in December 2021 and January 2022 respectively.
