Former Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha, has advised candidates under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to imbibe discipline and the I-can-do spirit as requirements for winning elections. He said the 2023 polls would be tough, owing to new challenges. He, therefore, urged the candidates and the leadership of the party to intensify efforts and strategies towards winning the forthcoming general elections. Ihedioha stated this at the issuance of Certificates of Return to the candidates held at the party’s secretariat in Owerri. He implored the party faithful in the state on the need to galvanise grass-root support for the party’s candidates across the levels. He said: “Only Alhaji Atiku Abubaka’s presidency would remedy Nigeria’s woes and reposition the country for greater good. “Anybody can lose election no matter how powerful and popular; no matter how prepared he is. So, it takes so many things to win an election.”
