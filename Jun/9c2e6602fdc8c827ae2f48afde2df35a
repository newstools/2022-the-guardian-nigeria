Says it is armed robbery, not reprisal attack The Ondo State Police Command has refuted a rumour that the Hausa community in Ondo town, the headquarters of Ondo West Local Council, was under a reprisal attack by some hoodlums. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Funmilayo Odunlami, in a statement in Akure yesterday, said that the news was being peddled by some mischief-makers to cause panic, tension and strife in the state. “The command wishes to state clearly that there was no reprisal attack on the Hausa community at Sabo Area in Ondo Town or any part of the state as purported by war mongers. “On Tuesday, June 7, 2022, there was an attempted robbery on a J5 vehicle with plate No. MKA – 469 YJ carrying onions and potatoes coming from Zaria enroute Ore. The vehicle had a stop over at Ondo town and was attacked by men of the underworld. “In the cause of this attempt, the robbers shot the driver, while the motor-boy escaped with bullet injury. A motorcyclist, alongside the pillion and a passerby, were also hit by stray bullets. “It is, however, disheartening that this peddlers, who are out to achieve no good, did not confirm the story before spreading the falsehood as the victims involved in the failed robbery are from Yoruba, Igbo and northern extraction,” the statement stated. Odunlami, who disclosed that investigation had commenced and effort ongoing to arrest the assailants, further stated: “The Commissioner of Police, Ondo State Command, Oyeyemi Adesoye Oyediran, has urged the people of the state to remain calm and disregard the fake news, as the rumour-mongers are out to stir unnecessary chaos and disrupt the peace of the state. “This is also to warn the peddlers of this fake news to desist as the command will not fold its arms and let them shatter the peace being enjoyed in the state.”
