In 2014, the couple got married at the vineyard and continued to spend several family holidays throughout their relationship there. In Pitt’s latest court filing with Jolie over the sale of Miraval, he claims that she had intentionally “sought to inflict harm on” him by selling her interests in the wine company. He added that they had agreed to never sell their respective interests in the family business without the other’s consent. In the court document filed on Friday at Los Angeles County Superior Court, Pitt’s legal team wrote that Miraval became his “passion” project that grew “into a multimillion-dollar global business and one of the world’s most highly regarded producers of rosé wine” through his work. He also accused Jolie of contributing “nothing to Miraval’s success.” The filing notes that Jolie had planned to sell her interest in October to Tenute del Mondo, which is “bent on taking control of Miraval” and is “indirectly owned and controlled by Yuri Shefler, the Russian billionaire who controls the Stoli Group.” “Jolie pursued and then consummated the purported sale in secret, purposely keeping Pitt in the dark, and knowingly violating Pitt’s contractual rights,” reads the filing from Pitt’s team. Pitt is seeking damages in an amount to be determined at trial, as well as the declaration of Jolie’s apparent sale as “null and void.” The actor is requesting a jury trial. Pitt is claiming breach of implied-in-fact contract, breach of quasi-contract in the alternative, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, abuse of rights under Luxembourg Civil Code Article 6-1, tortious interference with contractual relations, tortious interference with prospective business relations, and constructive trust. Because of her and Pitt’s ongoing divorce, Jolie had trouble selling her interests in Quimicum, the firm that owns and controls Miraval. Despite the fact that they were still in the middle of their divorce processes, she sought a California judge in July to allow the sale.
