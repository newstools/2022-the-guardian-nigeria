The Anambra House of Assembly has adjourned indefinitely in honour of a member, Okechukwu Okoye, who was abducted and beheaded by gunmen. The Speaker, Uche Okafor, announced the adjournment, following a motion moved by the Majority Leader, Nnamdi Okafor, and seconded by Emma Nwafor (Orumba South Constituency), yesterday. Okafor officially announced the death of Okoye, who, until his abduction, was representing Aguata Constituency ll in the House under the platform of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). He recalled that Okoye was abducted on May 15, while the police in the state confirmed his death on May 21. “With a heavy heart, we want to officially announce the death of one of us, Dr. Okechukwu Okoye, who was abducted on May 15 and the police command announced his unfortunate death on May 21. “We sympathise with his family, his community, Isuofia and the Aguata Constituency and pray that God consoles all of us. “We, therefore, urged security agencies to intensify efforts at ensuring that the perpetrators are apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law. “We also urge Governor Charles Soludo to do more in ensuring the security of life and property in the state. Residents should be security conscious and help security agencies with the right information for swift action,” he said. Anambra, like other states in the South East, has witnessed an increase in deadly attacks lately. The attacks, mostly targeted at security and public officials, including government facilities, have been attributed to the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which is agitating for a sovereign state for the Igbo-speaking people in the South East.
