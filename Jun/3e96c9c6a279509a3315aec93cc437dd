The use of eyeglasses is no longer for improvement of the eyesight alone, it is also now about beauty and elegance. Even fashion lovers who have sight issues go all the way to source classy frames to be taken to their optician for medicated lenses.
  
Beyond the need to achieve clearer vision, with a beautiful and appropriate face shape frame, eyeglasses have evolved to become fashion statement pieces that frame the face beautifully and revealing nothing short of sophistication.
  
This is why eyeglasses designers have created fun designs and styles with diverse face shape fits, and colours for all seasons.
  
However it is imperative to check face fittings while choosing frames, whether for vision aid or fashion statement.
