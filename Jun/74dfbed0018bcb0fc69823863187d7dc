Sterling Bank Plc has partnered Community Pot, a social impact project, to launch a pilot project in Lagos to feed 500 malnourished children across Nigeria. Speaking at the launching of the project themed ‘Adopt a Child to Recovery’, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Sterling One Foundation, Olapeju Ibekwe, said Sterling Bank is extremely passionate about children and their health. She said the bank was excited to be a part of the project and would support the Community Pot project to feed 200 children for about three months by providing them with Toddler Protein. The feed is manufactured by Whole Eats Foundation for feeding kids. Also speaking, convener and initiator of Community Pot, Mrs. Kemi Jeje, said: “We want to make an impact. We want to make a difference through the initiative.” She noted that at least, one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) aligns with the purpose of the project. “According to statistics, 420,000 children die yearly in Nigeria as a result of malnutrition and until one sees one of them, it is just a number one is hearing,” Jeje observed. She said about 2.5 million children in the country are deemed to be malnourished and the project would try to reach as many of these children as possible. She described Community Pot as a not-for-profit social impact project. The feed, Toddler Protein, was introduced to nursing mothers at the event by Founder and CEO of Mumpreneur Women Support Initiative Mofolusade Sonaike CEO of Marvel Natural Products, Temitope Akinyemi, described the project as phenomenal.
