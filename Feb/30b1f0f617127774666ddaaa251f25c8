Others were 29 rusted/unserviceable locally made pistol cartridges, 27 rusted /unserviceable locally made revolvers, and one Dane gun.

Sanda said the arms and the ammunition had been handed over to the center for onward delivery to the Office of the National Security Adviser (NSA) for necessary actions. Responding, Mr Chris Awolabi, Director of Operations of the Center, lauded the command for making a breakthrough in mopping illegal arms. He said the center would study the situation and forward its recommendations on the next line of action on the recovered arms and ammunition.
