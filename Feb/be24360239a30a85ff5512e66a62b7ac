 Razzie Awards Photo Just Jared Eight new Bruce Willis films have been nominated for the 2022 Razzie awards.   A parody of the Oscars, the Razzies ‘ honour’ the worst in film. Organizers of the Razzies have created a new category, “Worst Performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 Movie”, to accommodate the former Die Hard star’s questionable output last year. Willis starred in several low-budget action flicks released on streaming services playing the role of a washed-up sheriff, an ex-cop, a retired military general and a former CIA spy. None of these films was rated over 20% on film review website Rotten Tomatoes. In fact, three of the films, American Siege, Apex and Out of Death” — scored zero per cent from critics. Willis appears prominently in the marketing for his recent movies but often appears on-screen only very briefly. Netflix’s screen version of Broadway Diana: The Musical received the most Razzie nominations. Described by the Guardian as “the year’s most hysterically awful hate-watch,” the film received nine nominations, including worst picture. Also nominated in the Razzies, Jared Leto’s campy Italian accent and flamboyant performance beneath heavy prosthetics in House of Gucci gathered unwanted recognition. While his role as the dim-witted fashion heir has received genuine nominations from his Hollywood peers, it has also garnered widespread internet mockery. Jared Leto & EITHER His 17-Pound Latex Face, His Geeky Clothes or His Ridiculous Accent were nominated in the “worst screen couple” category. Another prominent Razzie nominee is basketball star LeBron James for Space Jam: A New Legacy. First awarded in 1981 in a LA living toom, the Razzie Award was the brainchild of UCLA film graduates and industry veterans, who chose the raspberry as a symbol of derision. The ‘winners’ of the 2022 Razzie awards will be unveiled a day before the Oscars, on March 26. However, there’s no surety that the actors will show up to receive their awards.
