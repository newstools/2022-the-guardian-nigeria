A group advocating the election of former Lagos State Bola Tinubu as the president said it is not responsible for an online platform seeking grants and donations for the campaign. Tinubu Support Group (TSG) said it has nothing to do with the online portal tagged “Tinubu Support Grant”. TSG spokesman Tosin Adeyanju said the portal is fake and certainly does not enjoy the authorization of Tinubu. Adeyanju said the Tinubu Support grant was set up by some unscrupulous element with identity forgery of Tinubu. The portal urged people to “hurry Now and Check if You are Eligible to Receive N25,000( Newly Increased ) Support Fund As Part Of TINUBU Support Grant.” But Adeyanju said the objective “of the criminals behind this scam is to defraud unsuspecting members of the public by advertising the identity of Alhaji Tinubu as being associated with the fraud. “We warn supporters and the general public not to patronize any portal called Tinubu Support grant,” Adeyanju said. “We call on law enforcement agencies to track and arrest the individuals behind this online crime and identity forgery and bring them to face the law.”
