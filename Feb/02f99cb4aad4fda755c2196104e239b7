Justice M. AbdulGarfa of the High Court sitting in Ilorin, Kwara State, has sentenced a former chairman of Kaiama Local Council of the state, Alhassan Bagudu, to one year for making false statement to an investigator. The Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) charged Bagudu to court on two counts bordering on making false statement to an investigator of the commission. ICPC Spokesperson, Azuka Ogugua, stated, yesterday, that Bagudu had pleaded not guilty when the charge was first read to him, which set the tone for the trial. During the trial, ICPC counsel, Peace Arocha and Golden Iwuagwu, told the court how the former council boss had purchased a used Toyota Prado jeep for his official use at N13 million, whereas the approval was for a brand new car. The court also heard how Bagudu, in count two, claimed that the jeep was purchased by Quadrish Motors, knowing same to be false, thereby making false statement to a constituted authority. The trial judge found Bagudu guilty on count two and sentenced him to one year with an option of N100,000 fine.
