Gov. Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, on Friday, appealed to the newly-inaugurated executive members of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state to tolerate and accommodate all manners of people to ensure overwhelming victory at polls. He made the plea at the swearing-in of the new executive members of the party in the state, held at the Presidential Lodge, Birnin Kebbi, the state capital. The governor, who was represented by Alhaji Bello Dantani, former Deputy Governor of the state, said the call became imperative in order to consolidate the strength of the party at all levels. While stressing the need for unity amongst party members, Bagudu observed that no party would succeed in an atmosphere of rancour. He informed the new exco that the forthcoming local government elections would serve as a litmus test of their leadership, hence the need for them to brace up to the challenge. Responding on behalf of the newly-inaugurated exco, Alhaji Sahabi Lolo, Zonal Vice Chairman, Kebbi North, appreciated Gov. Bagudu and other APC stakeholders in the state for finding them worthy of the positions. Lolo assured that the new exco would not disappoint, insisting that they would do everything possible to take the party to the next level of success for the good of Kebbi people. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the oath of office was administered by Mr Yakubu Maikyau, SAN.
