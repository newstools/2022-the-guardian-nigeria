The Executive Director/CEO of the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) Dr. Ezra Yakusak, has highlighted the significance of fiscal incentives in boosting the contributions of exporting companies to the economy. Incentives, including Export Development Fund (EDF), among others, have helped to keep exporting companies, particularly small and medium enterprises ((SMEs) afloat, he said. Yakusak stressed that without the Export Expansion Grant (EEG) scheme, a lot of exporters would have gone moribund. He disclosed this, yesterday, when he received a delegation of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria Export Group (MANEG) led by its Chairman, Ede Dafinone, in Abuja. While acknowledging the contributions of the creative industry to the country’s economy, the NEPC boss explained that the promotion of the industry, particularly music and movies, has helped to build the image of the country on the international scene. Dafinone requested the support of the Council in reforming the EEG payment process.
