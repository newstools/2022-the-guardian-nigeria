Following price losses in many blue-chip stocks, especially Okomu oil and NEM Assurance, the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) reopened on a downturn yesterday, market capitalisation declined by N41 billion. At the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index declined by 76.53 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.16 per cent, to close at 47,203.39 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N41 billion to close at N25.436 trillion. The market negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are Okomu Oil, SEPLAT Energy, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), PZ Cussons Nigeria and NEM Insurance. Analysts at United Capital Plc predicted that the market would maintain its bullish momentum as investors take positions ahead of the dividend season amid pockets of profit-taking. Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Asides from banking names, large cap stocks like Seplat, Nestle and Nigerian Breweries also elevated activity levels and we expect this trade pattern to filter into tomorrow’s session as the market continues to trade mixed.” Market breadth closed at par, recording 23 gainers and 23 losers. Okomu Oil led the losers’ chart with 10 per cent to close at N127.80 kobo. NEM Insurance followed with a decline of 9.61 per cent to close at N3.01 kobo while Guinea Insurance lost 9.09 per cent to close at 20 kobo.
