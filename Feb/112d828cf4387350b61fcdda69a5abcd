Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) has denied paying N20 billion to ghost contractors. Ijaw Youth Group through its spokesperson, Ebilade Ekerefe, had alleged that the NDDC paid the sum to ghost contractors. In a statement issued, yesterday, the NDDC Director, Corporate Affairs, Dr. Ibitoye Abosede, described the claim by the group as not only laughable but most unfortunate.
 
He said the NDDC did not pay any N20 billion naira to any ghost contractor or anyone for that matter as alleged by the group.
 
Abosede said: “The spurious lies are being masterminded, fabricated and orchestrated by persons who are positioning their relatives and associates for ultimate appointment into the board of the NDDC.  Abosede maintained that NDDC under the interim administration and the supervision of the Minister, Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, would continue to be focused and prudent in the management of its resources for the benefit of the people of the region and remain committed to the vision of President Muhammadu Buhari.
