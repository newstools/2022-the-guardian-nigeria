 Weiz Dhrum Franklyn AW 2021 When we think of flowers, we think of pretty, girly, cute, everything but masculine. From dress to pants and even accessories, women have an unspoken ownership of florals such that guys in floral prints become an interesting conversation starter. Masculinity and menswear have long been tied together. It’s no wonder that menswear gravitates towards dark solid colours and boxy designs working to create a broader, fitter shape and thus appear more manly. However, menswear and masculinity have achieved a measure of security in themselves to allow for exploring and participating in trends without buckling under. From palate play to fabrics as well as patterns, men’s fashion has become an interesting space. Fashion trends over the years have become more adventurous, to include a touch of this said femininity into male fashion. The floral trend made its way into menswear with the Hawaiian shirt. Its large spread appeal gave way for designers to work with floral patterns outside of the traditional holiday button down. Currently, floral styles have expanded to include Native American, African and English floral prints. The designs show the interest in global fashions and the willingness to experiment. Nigerian male fashion is not left of this trend as florals have been incorporated into native attires as well as accent pieces. Designers like Weiz Dhrum Franklyn (@weizdhrumfranklyn) Onwuchekwa (@onwuchekwa-bcd) and Orange Culture Nigeria (@orangecultureng) are some Nigerian designers that experiment with florals, softer colours and a touch of femininity in creating their designs. Whether it is in a classic Hawaiian button-down shirt or coordinates, a suit or a pair of shoes, florals can be fashionably incorporated into men’s fashion.
