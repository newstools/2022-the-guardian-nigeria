Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders in Ikwuano and Umuahia have declared their stance on the Abia Charter of Equity, saying they will field governorship candidates if their Ngwa counterparts insist on breaching the zoning arrangement. The stakeholders, who had restated their preference for zoning of the governorship position on senatorial basis, said it amounted to “wickedness nurtured by selfishness if Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, a beneficiary of zoning breaches the agreement” Rising from a meeting in Umuahia, yesterday, they insisted that if the seat were not zoned to Abia North, the zone that should rightfully produce the next governor, then Ikwuano Umuahia would contest, as it would have become an open contest. They also reaffirmed their resolve to honour their long standing agreement with their brothers of Isiala Ngwa North, South and Osisioma councils, regarding the senate seat, saying that Ikwuano and Umuahia do not intend to go against the agreement hence it is the turn of Umunna Ngwa to produce the next senator. “Ikwuano and Umuahia have agreed that the next governor should come from Abia North Senatorial zone, but if the governorship having gone round the three senatorial districts, is thrown open, Ikwuano and Umuahia stakeholders will insist that the context must exclude Abia South Senatorial district, the current occupier of the position,” the communiqué reads.
