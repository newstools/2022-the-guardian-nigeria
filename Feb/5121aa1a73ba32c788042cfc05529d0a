The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has announced plans to amplify the voices of members of the fourth estate of the realm with its forthcoming maiden LCCI-MEDIA stakeholders forum. Dr Segun Alabi, Head, Corporate Communications, LCCI, made this known in a statement issued on Monday in Lagos. Alabi said that media practitioners had painstakingly and otherwise reported happenings with persons and situations and countries, yet their voices were unheard. He noted that their voices were critical to the economic, security, and social well-being of the nation, as well as its advancement. This, according to him, informs the theme of the March 24 forum:  “Economic Stability and Security as Tools for National Development: The Media Perspective.” Alabi said that the President, Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, Malam Mukhtar Sirajo, and some notable persons from the media were expected at the forum. “They have listened to others, reported their stories and amplified the voices of the masses, but as members of the fourth estate of the realm, their voices are unheard. “As a result, we have decided to use this forum to give them a voice as we engage your favorite media practitioners on the pathway to Nigeria’s economic prosperity. “This initiative is part of the chamber’s media relations and public policy advocacy. “We believe that a successful advocacy must be research-based and supported by the media. “We count on the support role of the media in achieving this cardinal function of the Chamber in ensuring an enabling environment for businesses to thrive,” he said.
