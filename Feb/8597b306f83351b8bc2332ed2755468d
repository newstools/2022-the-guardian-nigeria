President, Nigeria Pitch Awards, Shina Philips, has explained that the journey to the eighth edition of the awards “is the story of the determination of all stakeholders to create and sustain a reward platform for our footballers, administrators and football lovers and supporters.” Philips told a gathering of journalists and other football stakeholders in Lagos that the awards, which will hold in March, has been refined in such a way that it is now the most authentic gauge of the performance of Nigeria’s football personalities in each given year. He recalled that in its inaugural press conference in 2012, the organisers promised that the Nigeria Pitch Awards would offer Nigerians more than awards to deserving footballers, adding, “in continuing with this vision to offer more to improve sports in Nigeria, we are pleased to announce an annual symposium on sports. “The symposium which will precede the annual award ceremony will attract local and international speakers. Our vision is to make the gathering a unique opportunity to renew and re-focus national attention on sports in Nigeria and open up avenues for administrators to harness the opportunities sports provide. We will outline more details of this project in the coming months,” he stated.
