Super Falcons of Nigeria, yesterday, beat Cote d’Ivoire 1-0 to qualify for the 2022 Africa Women Cup of Nations billed to hold in Morocco. The Nigerian girls won the first leg played in Abuja 2-0 to qualify for the competition on a 3-0 aggregate. At the encounter played at Stade Robert Champroux in Abidjan, Esther Okorokwo’s 87th minutes goal gave the Super Falcons the only goal after goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie had earlier prevented the Lady Elephants from scoring in the 34th minutes. The Ivoirians were awarded a penalty by referee Zouwaira Souley from Niger Republic, but Nnadozie pulled off a stunning save to deny the Lady Elephants from the spot. The game flowed back and forth for large swathes of the first half. Coach Randy Waldrum made two changes to the starting line-up from the first leg, bringing in midfielder Regina Otu and forward Francisca Ordega.
 
The lively Ordega thought she had given Nigeria the lead halfway into the first period, but the Nigerien referee ruled it out. With the victory in Abidjan yesterday, the Super Falcons will be in Morocco later in the year to defend their African title, which they have won nine times. Last Friday in Abuja, the Super Falcons got the two goals off the boots of U.S.-based striker Ifeoma Onumonu. Super Falcons 23-woman squad to Abidjan for yesterday’s encounter includes Captain Onome Ebi, Onumomu, defender Ashleigh Plumptre, midfielders Rasheedat Ajibade, Toni Payne and Rita Chikwelu. Among the strikers were Esther Okoronkwo and Gift Monday. Barcelona striker, Asisat Oshoala, could not make the trip to Abidjan due to injury. She did not take part in the first leg played in Abuja last Friday. Host, Morocco, and Uganda have already qualified for the 12-team finals holding from July 2 to 23 this year.
