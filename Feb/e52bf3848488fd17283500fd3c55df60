President of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), Adesina Adedayo has said that the institute is gaining more ground in the global space by expanding its frontiers for the development of taxation. Adedayo stated this recently during the institute’s 40th-anniversary celebration with the theme ‘Evolution of Taxation as a Profession in Nigeria: The Birth of CITN’. Speaking on how far it has gone and what lies ahead, the CITN boss said he sees an institute that understands its role in terms of thought leadership, tax legislative, administration and policy intervention. According to him, the institute understands the impact of technology on how the business of governance should be conducted. One of the founding fathers of CITN, Morenike Babington-Ashaye, called for more collaboration between the Federal Government and the institute. She said that the government should put CITN into more use by ensuring that the institute remains at the forefront of all issues relating to taxation practice in the country. “Let the government at all levels, organisations and individuals make good use of the CITN. You can use taxation to discipline people, there are a lot of people that are in possession of resources, wealth and property that their sources are not known,” she said. First Lady of Ogun State, Bamidele Abiodun, urged the CITN to continue in its efforts to promote taxation in Nigeria. She was particularly impressed by how the institute outlined its plans to grow the taxation system. Abiodun said that CITN has all it takes to transform taxation practice in the country. “We look forward to seeing the transformation role you are going to play in many years ahead in the country’s taxation system,” she said.
