OneBank, a digital product of Sterling Bank Plc, has said it will celebrate and eulogise 250 Nigerian workers every week through its ‘One Professional’ initiative as a way of appreciating their tenacity and contribution to nation-building. Group Head of Digital Banking at Sterling Bank, Oladipo Alabede, who disclosed this in a statement, said Nigerian workers deserved reward for their tenacity and contributions to the growth of the economy. He said: “No nation can boast of tremendous progress or enjoy significant growth without a diligent, empowered and excited workforce. Over the years, Nigerian professionals have made giant strides across various industries like medicine, engineering and law, to mention but a few.” He said the ‘One Professional’ is Sterling Bank’s way of amplifying the success stories of Nigerian workers while appreciating them. He explained that the initiative would give an opportunity to Nigerian workers to share stories of how they found themselves in their chosen careers. “These stories will help inspire younger generations to make even better decisions while learning from mistakes made and lessons shared by others,” Alabede said. He said Nigerian professionals would be provided with the opportunity to share inspirational stories of how they ventured into their various fields of endeavors every month throughout the year. According to him, Nigerian workers stand a chance to win cash prizes from OneBank when they go ahead to download the OneBank app on Google and Play store and open an account. He said the mechanics of the initiative was for a worker, who is a potential customer of the bank, to create a OneBank account, select sector/profession as part of the account opening requirement and complete the account opening process. He said details on how workers could benefit from the initiative are also found on OneBank’s social media channels, including Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.
