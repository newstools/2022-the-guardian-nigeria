An oil production vessel has exploded off the Nigerian coast, months after an oil spillage wreaked havoc in the Niger Delta. The vessel – the Trinity Spirit – blew up on Wednesday, Shebah Exploration & Production Co. (SEPCOL), which has the vessel on a lease, said in a statement. The ship is able to store about 2 million barrels of oil and can process up to 22,000 barrels a day. A wellhead belonging to Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company blew up on November 5 in Nembe, Bayelsa State. The leakage was not plugged until a month later. SEPCOL said it has notified authorities of the explosion and that is already being investigated. “At this time there are no reported fatalities, but we can confirm that there were ten crew men on board the vessel prior to the incident and we are prioritising investigations with respect to their safety and security,” it said.
