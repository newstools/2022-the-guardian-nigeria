You have come to the right place. Contrary to what many people believe, finding the right gift for your partner comes really easy when you know what he likes, especially now that men have become more vocal about not receiving boxers and singlets. For instance, if he loves video games, buying gaming accessories would be the perfect gift. Regardless of what your partner’s hobbies are, it is the thought that matters. Here are 5 thoughtful gift ideas for your partner this Valentine’s Day: One interesting detail about gift boxes is that you can always personalise them. When creating a gift box for your partner, make sure to include at least one of everything they like if you can. Rather than opt for the bulk curated boxes, go the extra mile to personalise your boxes to match your partner’s likes. If he is a car lover, throw in a footmat, car seat covers, a car diffuser, tyres, a phone mount and a cup holder. If he loves to dress up, your gift box should contain some sneakers, perfumes, cufflinks and any fashion accessory you are sure he’ll love. He will definitely appreciate a more personalised gift instead of a regular box with drinks and chocolates. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1662947 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Topping-or-subsciption-ideas-for-your-lover.-Photo-giftlab-1-748x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1024" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Topping-or-subsciption-ideas-for-your-lover.-Photo-giftlab-1-748x598.jpg 748w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Topping-or-subsciption-ideas-for-your-lover.-Photo-giftlab-1-300x240.jpg 300w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Topping-or-subsciption-ideas-for-your-lover.-Photo-giftlab-1-600x480.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Topping-or-subsciption-ideas-for-your-lover.-Photo-giftlab-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Subscription Boxes Everyone loves a great deal, especially one that saves them some money.
