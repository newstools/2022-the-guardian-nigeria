Former Super Eagles Coach, Christian Chukwu, has described Egypt’s journey to the final game of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations despite losing their opening game as the type of resilience Nigeria should emulate. Chukwu said Egypt’s coach, Carlos Quiroz, was able to change the situation by adopting a different strategy because he knew his players, having spent enough time with the team. He noted that Eagles could not progress beyond the round of 16 because Eguaveon did not have much time to work with the Eagles, unlike his Egyptian counterpart. He urged the NFF to appoint a substantive coach for the Super Eagles immediately, saying that continued delay could hamper the team’s preparation for the final World Cup qualifier against Black Stars of Ghana. “Egypt were able to get to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations despite their loss to Nigeria because the coach know the strengths and weaknesses of his players and therefore, know how to adjust the team. “This should teach the NFF that they should decide on national team coaches early enough for the technical crew to have enough time to work on the squad. “Eguaveon was given the Eagles’ job just a few days before the Africa Cup of Nations and it showed in the round of 16 games. To avoid another national disaster, the NFF should announce Eguaveon or any other coach they want now. This will give the coach some time to plan for the games against Ghana. “Delay in announcing the coach could backfire and cost Nigeria a place in the Qatar 2022 World Cup,” Chukwu said.
