• Businesses worry about inconsistent govt policies
• .ng is 0.000504353 of 365.5m world’s registered ccTLD
• INEC, banks, eCommerce firms, MDAs still adopt .com; .net; .org
•  Country loses millions of dollar to foreign adoption About 17 years after the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NiRA) was formed, birthing the country’s code top-level domain (ccTLD), the .ng share of the nation’s identity on the Internet remains very low. The .ng is Nigeria’s identity on the World Wide Web (www). The Guardian checks showed that the .ng is 0.000504353 of the world’s 365.5 million registered and functional ccTLD. This is in spite of the country’s over 200 million estimated population and more than 100 million Internet users.
  
For emphasis, a domain name is an identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority or control within the Internet protocol. The right to use a domain name is delegated by domain name registrars who are accredited by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) – the international organisation charged with overseeing the name and number systems of the Internet.
   
Findings showed that apathy towards .ng, especially from companies that are registered in Nigeria and also from governments’ Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs), have continued to increase capital flight out of the country.  “Using the .ng domain extension for personal and business websites and online platforms offers tremendous benefits. Using the .ng domain name for your website provides the opportunity for businesses to reach the Nigerian market more easily.  “We would like to push all Nigerian companies online and ensure their subsequent adoption of .ng, which will give global visibility. Nigerians should be eager to do this.” 
   
Rudman called on prominent Nigerian-owned businesses, such as Konga and banks that are still on .com to switch to .ng.  “INEC is still not on .ng. As companies register in .com; .org; .net, they are creating jobs and opportunities for another economy. We must change this trend this year,” Nweke stressed.  It further disclosed that domain name registrations decreased by 3.3 million, or 0.9 per cent, year over year.
   
The American firm said the .com and .net TLDs had a combined total of 168.0 million domain name registrations in the domain name base at the end of the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 2.8 million domain name registrations, or 1.7 per cent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. The .com and .netTLDs had a combined increase of 7.3 million domain name registrations, or 4.6 per cent, year over year.
