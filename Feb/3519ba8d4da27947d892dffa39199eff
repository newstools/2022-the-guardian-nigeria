The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), yesterday, expressed serious concern over the unending bloodletting and carnage in the South East region and upbraided security agencies for their failure to end the blight. It, therefore, urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Alkali Usman Baba, to take urgent and decisive actions to stem the trend. HURIWA said the situation was worsening because President Buhari had been tolerating dereliction of duty and failure of intelligence on the part of his security chiefs, adding that the IGP, who is in charge of the primary internal security and law enforcement in the country would have been sacked for his failure. In a statement issued by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, the group lamented that it is disheartening that the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigerian Army, the Department of State Services (DSS) and others, have failed to end the killings in the South East and demystify the unknown gunmen. Specifically, the group cited the killing of a first-class graduate of the Information and Media Studies from the Bayero University Kano (BUK), Sule Matthew, at Ekwulobia in Anambra State. It also lamented the gruesome murder of a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, in Imo State in May last year, and the killing of Dr. Chike Akunyili, widower of the late Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dora Akunyili in September 2021, among others.
