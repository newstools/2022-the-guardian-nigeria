Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, has pledged the state’s continuous support for the Okpekpe International 10k Road Race, affirming that it will return bigger and better this year. Shaibu also reiterated the commitment of the state government towards ensuring it retains its historic and number one status in West Africa. “The Okpekpe International 10km Road Race is back this year with the eighth edition and it has come to stay,” said Shaibu at a press conference in Benin heralding this year’s race. He dismissed insinuations that he is against the organisation of the race, saying, “The race is a constant fixture in the calendar of the state, just as it is in the calendar of World Athletics. “Nobody, not even I, Comrade Philip Shaibu, can kill the race.” He added that plans are in top gear to institutionalise the race, disclosing that the state recently held a meeting with Pamodzi Sports Marketing, the main organisers of the race. “We agreed on the need to institutionalise it so that it can live after us. That’s the level of commitment the Edo State government is showing,” he added. The deputy governor disclosed that all athletes participating in the race this year would undergo antigen tests for COVID-19.
