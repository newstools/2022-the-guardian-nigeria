Anambra State Governor-elect, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has refuted the claims that he requested those wishing to serve in his government to submit formal applications. Soludo’s denial followed a statement issued by the Executive Director of the 80-man Inauguration Transition Committee on behalf of its Chairman, Prof. Oby Ezekwesili, which indicated that only those who comply would make the incoming administration. But in a swift reaction, the committee has asked members of the public to disregard the report, stating that the governor-elect, Soludo, did not authorize such a statement. But The Guardian learnt that the committee has not denied authoring the letter, but might not have approved its release. The rebuttal titled: Re: Leak Of Document Of Talent Hunt Initiative, signed by an anonymous executive director of the Transition Committee on behalf of Chairman Anambra State Transition committee, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili lent credence to the fact that it was a leaked document. It was also learnt that a database for the expression of interest and submission of credentials was initiated online, but has been partially shut. “It has come to our attention that a wrong memorandum directing individuals to apply for political appointments in Anambra State has been circulating on various digital platforms. “We apologise for this development and ask members of the public to ignore the document and wrong information being circulated,” the statement reads.
