Prominent Nigerians, including a former governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, and former Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Solomon Dalung, yesterday, established a third force under the aegis of The National Movement (TNM). At the event, which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja, the new movement said it would take over power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. Convener of the event, Kwankwaso, said it was a collective desire to rescue the country. He said: “We resolved that there must be a Nigeria first before politics. While some of us will want to contest, we must work together to rescue the country. Restructuring the corporate units of our great country is possible and doable. As vowed democrats, we are ready and prepared to act in concert with the wishes and desires of all our people. We will embark on massive, comprehensive and unprecedented reform of our national life in order to improve the living conditions of all our people.” Dalung, on his part, apologised to Nigerians for the failure of the APC to fulfil its campaign promises, especially on insecurity. He added: “As a Christian, while I was campaigning in Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto, where the common people were donating money and even fueling my car, I never promised them that bandits would take over their land. I must apologise. We never promised Nigerians that they are going to find themselves so divided.”
