Polish Deputy Interior Minister Pawel Szefernaker on Saturday said 100,000 people have crossed the border into Poland from Ukraine since Russia’s invasion this week. “From the onset of warfare in Ukraine through today, along the entire border with Ukraine, 100,000 people have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland,” Szefernaker told reporters in the border village of Medyka, southeastern Poland. He said 90 percent of the refugees have concrete places to go in Poland, such as the homes of friends or family, but that the remainder is seeking help at nine reception centres set up along the border. The centres offer meals and medical care, a place to rest as well as any necessary information.
