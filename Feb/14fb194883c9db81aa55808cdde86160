Determined to increase insurance penetration in the country, Guinea Insurance Plc has initiated a self-service motor insurance e-portal that allows customers to purchase insurance products in less than two minutes. Speaking on the new offering at the weekend, the Managing Director, Guinea Insurance, Ademola Abidogun, said the new offering was introduced to provide the insuring public with unlimited access to make real-time purchases from anywhere and whenever they needed to. Ademola noted that the portal would give customers the freedom to buy authentic and reliable motor insurance policies without any geographical barrier as long as the vehicle is within the Nigerian land borders. He said: “As it stands today, consumer behaviour is undeniably shifting and favouring effortlessness more than before, whether by simply engaging with a business quickly and conveniently or by easily accessing the most relevant information to meet their individual needs. “Insurance consumers nationwide would be able to choose and make informed decisions to purchase motor insurance products that best suit their insurance needs. Our digital transformation is driven with these key concepts in mind. “By updating and improving upon the portal, we aim to provide policyholders with all the information and tools they need to self-serve at any time, creating a seamless experience and better meeting their needs,” he said.
