After over three years of dispute, Samsung Heavy Industries (SHIN) Nigeria Limited and LADOL Integrated Logistics Free Zone Enterprise (LADOL) have executed a settlement that resolves the historic and outstanding issues currently before the Nigerian and international courts to bring the two sides back together in a lasting partnership. 
   
The joint venture between SHIN and LADOL was established when SHIN was awarded the $3.3billion Egina Floating Production and Offloading (FPSO) project, which required the construction of the fabrication and integration yard to carry out the in-country aspect of the Egina project.  “SHIN and LADOL have welcomed the settlement agreement, which will be registered as an official Judgment in the High Court in London. “It will also be registered in the respective courts in Nigeria. In addition, the settlement agreement has been approved by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) and the Nigerian Exports Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA),” the statement reads.
