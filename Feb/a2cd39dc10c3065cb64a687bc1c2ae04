When asked in an interview about the  “Easy on Me” crooner Megan expressed that Adele is on her dream list of people she would like to collaborate with. In reference to the viral Tik Tok mashup of Adele’s ‘‘Water Under Bridge’’ and ‘‘Body’’ that easily shortened the two performances into the catchy remix. “If Adele wants me to come get on the track, be the dancer, I’m there, I’m here for it,” Megan told People. “Somebody tell her to call me because I’m ready!” She also appreciated the power of manifestation for her “Savage” partnership with Beyoncé “Because I’ve manifested Beyoncé, I feel like I have reached my ultimate goal,” said Megan. Her partnership with Beyoncé is evidence that manifesting your ideas actually does work, and one day, we will be dancing to an Adele–Megan Thee Stallion song in the club. Megan also shared one more dream partnership she’d love to work with- Rihanna but RiRi might be busy for the next few months with a baby on the way for A$AP Rocky.
