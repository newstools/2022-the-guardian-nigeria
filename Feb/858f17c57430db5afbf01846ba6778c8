Secretary General of Maritime Organisation of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), Dr. Paul Adalikwu, has presented the organisation’s strategy to Government of Cote d’voire. Adalikwu made the presentation in his maiden meeting with the Ivorian Secretary of State for Transportation, Dr. Celestine Doh Serey. Adalikwu, who thanked the government of Cote d’Ivoire for the support given to him in the course of his election as the secretary general, solicited for the government’s assistance for a permanent secretariat edifice for the multilateral body. Highpoints of the SG’s strategic plan is the Regional Maritime Development Bank (RMDB), which is planned for formal inauguration in coming months. He also presented the new organogram and proposed draft budget for the year 2022 to the Secretary of State, Permanent Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the host country’s government. Adalikwu, who assumed office fully in December 2021, in Abidjan after his victory at the 16th Extraordinary Session in Accra, Ghana, thanked the Ivorian government for their invaluable support to MOWCA since its inception and other efforts it has made to consolidate the body. He reassured that the MOWCA secretariat under his watch would keep the host government and all organs of the organisation fully abreast with its activities, while welcoming inputs to achieve efficiency and fulfil expectations of member countries. Serey, in his response, commended Adalikwu for the visit and congratulated him on his election. The Ivorian Secretary of State for Transportation said he has listened to Adalikwu’s submissions and saw sincerity and willingness to make things better for the organisation, however, the limiting factor would be finance. He gave assurances that the government of Cote d’Ivoire is fully in support of the new SG’s administration, who is a Nigerian, knowing the size and strength of the nation and the ability of its citizens to perform and deliver.
