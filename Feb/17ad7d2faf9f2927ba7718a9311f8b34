Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the 36 states of the federation have debunked the existence of differences in the party. They, therefore, passed a vote of confidence in the National Chairman, Olu Agunloye and National Secretary, Shehu Gabam. The backing came weeks after a faction led by Abdul Isiaq suspended Agunloye and Gabam for alleged misconduct. The Chairman, Forum of State Chairmen, SDP, Oke Idawene, told journalists, yesterday, that the decision to support Agunloye and Gabam was reached at the end of its two-day retreat in Abuja. Idawene, who chairs the party in Delta State, noted that the duo had performed credibly in reforming the party ahead of next year’s general elections. “The forum of SDP chairmen in the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) met in Abuja in a two-day retreat and announced that; the state chairmen, as individuals and collectively, are in support of the leadership of the party under Dr. Olu Agunloye (as Chairman) and Shehu Gabam (as National Secretary); “That all the state chairmen stand with the National Working Committee (NWC) in its efforts to instil discipline, focus, decorum and determination in the party in its recent efforts to strengthen and stabilise the party structures across the nation,” they said. The forum also noted, with great delight, that the party has fielded candidates to contest in all the by-elections in Ondo, Cross River, Plateau and Imo states, at the end of this month and in the gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states in June and July. It added: “The forum wishes to pledge its loyalty, support and full readiness to work with the NWC under Agunloye in all the programmes of the party to win elections and bring power to the hands of social democrats for the true development of the Nigerian people.”
