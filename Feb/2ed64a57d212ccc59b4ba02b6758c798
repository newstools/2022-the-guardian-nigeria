Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, yesterday, teed off the maiden Armed Forces Pro-Am golf tournament in Jaji, the home of the Armed Forces Infantry. The event, which will end on February 6, is the first professional golf tournament the Ola Saad Ibrahim Golf Club situated inside the massive complex of the Armed Forces Staff College is hosting in its five decades of existence. Captain of the Club, Navy Commander J.O. Shaibu, disclosed that Governor el Rufai was specially chosen to perform the ceremonial ‘tee-off’ of the event because of his extra ordinary synergy effort with the Armed Forces in ensuring that Kaduna is free from banditry and kidnapping. About 150 golf professionals and 350 amateurs from across the country are participating in the event. “The governor has done a lot to ensure that Kaduna is enjoying peace once again,” Shaibu, who is equally the Commandant of the Secondary School inside the Staff College, noted. “The governor is always reaching out to the Armed Forces to ensure that safety prevails in Kaduna State. And the fact that peace has returned is reason over 500 golfers would converge in Jaji for a weeklong golfing activity.” Patron and one of the moving spirits behind the Jaji club, Major General M.G Ali, is also elated that the Ola Saad Golf Club is hosting professional golfers for the first time in about 50 years in existence. The General, who is also the Commandant of the Nigeria Army School of Infantry, described the development as a dream come true. “I love the game of golf with passion,” General Ali confessed. “We have a great golf course in Jaji here and we have been hosting quality amateur tournaments over the years. So, when the captain came with the idea that we should host a professional event for the first time, I supported him fully. I can only assure that we shall collectively strive to make this an annual event.”
