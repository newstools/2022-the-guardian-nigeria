At least three dead bodies have been recovered from the rubbles of a three-storey building that collapsed on Saturday afternoon at Akanbi Crescent, Yaba, Lagos State. Two persons have also been rescued by emergency workers. The incident comes a few months after the collapse of a 21-storey building that claimed the lives of 45 persons at Gerrard Road, Ikoyi area of the state. It was gathered that a section of the building, which was still under construction, collapsed on another building beside it. An eyewitness who spoke with the media said a part of the building had collapsed last year. When contacted, Director-General (DG), Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Oluwafemi Oke-Osanyitolu, told The Guardian that the agency was working to rescue more people who may be trapped in the rubbles. “The building was said to have shown signs on Thursday and when one of the neighbours called their attention to it, they told him off,” Ibrahim Farinloye, National Emergency Management Agency acting zonal coordinator, southwest, said. The State Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Idris Salako, said in a statement that Lagos State Building Control Agency sealed off the construction site in 2021. He said work resumed without authorisation. ”Preliminary findings indicated that the site had been sealed off twice by the Lagos State Building Control Agency in 2021 for non-compliance with building regulations, after which the site was abandoned,” Salako said. “However, the developer later broke the government seal, sneaked into the site and recommenced construction without official authorisation. “As at 9:00 p.m., one person had been pulled out alive, while two deaths were recorded. “The developer in charge of the site has since been arrested and handed over to police, while rescue operation is ongoing,” he said.
