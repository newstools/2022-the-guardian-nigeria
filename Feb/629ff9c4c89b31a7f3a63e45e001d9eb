SGFC Athletics Sports Club, yesterday, defeated Beyond Limits Football Club to win the Nigeria Nationwide League One Invitational Pre-season Tournament tagged, ‘Evolution Cup 2022,’ at Remo Stars FC Stadium, Ikenne Remo, Ogun State. The tournament, sponsored by Bet9ja, saw Ilorin-based SGFC Athletics outscoring hosts, Beyond Limits, 4-3 in a penalty shoot that decided the final game following a 1-1 draw in regulation and added time. Speaking on the team’s victory, an excited SGFC Athletics’ coach, Jamiu Issa, said his boys came to Ijebu Ode, venue of the tournament, to gain experience. “We did not come to the pre-season tournament to win the cup. We came here to prepare the players for the NLO 1 league because the club is just a month old. But it turned out that the reverse was the case we ended up winning the pre-season after beating our opponent in the final. “I want to see this as a sign of good things to come for the team and it will also serve as a moral boosters for the boys going into the league proper campaign, beginning from March 9,” he said. Meanwhile the President of SGFC, Richard Opanuga, who also spoke to The Guardian, commended Coach Issa for a worthy performance, saying, “The coach has a winning tradition and worked tirelessly with the team’s technical crew to see the boys through. “Our vision and hope is to ensure that the talents we have are kept off the streets for them to succeed in their football career. “The team is scheduled to travel to Accra, Ghana, for additional camping under the watch of Sportflames Communications. They will embark on other friendlies prior to the season opener.”
