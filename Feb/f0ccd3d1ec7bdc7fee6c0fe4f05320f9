Former Governor of Ekiti State, Chief Segun Oni, has denied joining the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to contest the June 18 governorship election, describing the report as an absolute falsehood. The former governor recently resigned his membership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after coming second in the primary of the party held on January 26, 2022, which he alleged was massively rigged in favour of Bisi Kolawole. Oni said that the story that he had joined APGA, as well as pulling out of the party again, was just part of the orchestrated blackmail put together by those whom he said are being haunted by his aspiration. This was contained in a statement by the Director of Media and Publicity, Segun Oni Movements, Mr. Jackson Adebayo, which was made available to journalists at the weekend in Ado-Ekiti. Oni stated that many political parties had approached him to fly their flags in June 18 election but that he didn’t agree to join any due to his ongoing wide consultations. He stated further that some stakeholders in Ekiti project did approached him to contest on APGA’s platform, but that he declined, arguing that the people of Ekiti State would come up with a party they love before the close of the substitution window. “It is laughable reading on social media that Segun Oni is leaving APGA that he has never joined before; or how can you resign from an association you never belong. “What they wanted to achieve with such a blackmail has however backfired, as the people of the state refused to buy into their shenanigans. “As it stands today, the only person that the people could trust with the governance of the state is Segun Oni as evidently displayed at every nook and cranny of the state,” the statement stated. He added that the Movements would not be bothered by the distractions in the build up to the election, saying: “We will not be bothered as we are too focused than to be distracted by writings put together to cause confusions.”
