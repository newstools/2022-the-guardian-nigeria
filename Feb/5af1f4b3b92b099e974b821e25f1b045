A late-night fire outbreak Friday destroyed goods worth millions at the Hassan Ola Blocks of Aguyi Ironsi International Trade Centre, of the Ladipo Auto Spare Parts Market, Mushin, Lagos. Friday fire outbreak happened after the November 2021 gas explosion that claimed the lives of five persons at the Papa Ajao section of the market. Officials of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service stopped the fire from spreading further. Director, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Adeseye Margaret, said the fire was reported at 10:54 p.m. on Friday following a series of calls and was swiftly doused by the nearby Isolo Fire Station of the Agency. “Upon arrival, firemen called for back-up from other Lagos Fire Service locations and other emergency responders. “It was discovered that the fire rapidly spread across three blocks that housed auto spare parts traders within the market and were aided by combustible substances stored around the affected locations. “The Fire was, however, curtailed from further spread to other blocks through the swift professional intervention of firefighters and other emergency responders. She said the situation would demand a thorough and collaborative investigation to ascertain the cause of the fire. But there was no report of injury or loss of lives during the incident.
