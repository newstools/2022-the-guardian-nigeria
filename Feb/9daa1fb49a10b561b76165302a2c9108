The Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) has urged the private sector to invest and support public libraries to boost education in the country.
   
In a communiqué issued at the end of regular meeting of examination bodies and libraries trade union group of NASU, which held at the National Union of Teachers (NUT) Hall, Kuto, Abeokuta, Ogun State, the Council-in-Session expressed worry over the neglect of public libraries in Nigeria. 
    
It noted that most public libraries are in a deplorable state as a result of inadequate facilities, poor funding and under-staffing of the national and state libraries.
   
The communiqué, which was signed by the Chairman and Secretary, Examination Bodies and Libraries Trade Group Council, Sunday Obabunmi and E.O Amalu respectively, argued that libraries, as conveyors of knowledge, are important contributors to the efficient running of private enterprises and the overall economic development of the country.  Of concern to the union is the managements’ penchant for transferring its executives under the guise of ‘exigency of duty’. It condemned the anti-union policy of such management and viewed it as a ploy towards destabilising the activities of the union.
