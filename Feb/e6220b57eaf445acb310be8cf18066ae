Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter, the actor revealed that the latest franchise, Spider-Man: No Way Home, gave him a chance to make up for this regret. He said, “Something I can look back on now with a little bit of clarity and regret is that I never called him when I took over as Spider-Man.” “Had someone said to me after my second movie that I was done, and this other kid was taking over, I would’ve been heartbroken. So looking back, I wish I had the chance to make amends with him, but this film was our opportunity,” he continued. “It was not only an opportunity for him to make peace with the character and the studio, but it was also an opportunity for me and him to have this moment where we realize we could share this thing.” “The look on his face when he saves Zendaya [MJ] is totally genuine, and I’m really proud of him. I’m really chuffed that he got this opportunity to win back the world and for people to be reminded that his Spider-Man movies are fantastic and brilliant in their own right,” he added. Garfield had played Spider-Man in 2012’s The Amazing Spider-Man, and its 2014 sequel. The duo appeared together onscreen for the first time in No Way Home, alongside Tobey Maguire, for the ultimate crossover film. Holland admitted he was “nervous” meeting Garfield and Maguire, revealing that he received emotional support from Zendaya and costar Jacob Batalon. “At our first rehearsal, I had asked Jacob and Zendaya to come with me to just kind of be there as, like, my support system,” Holland told Deadline last month. “Like, ‘I’m gonna go meet these guys, I’m really nervous about it.'” Holland also expressed his support for another franchise starring Garfield. He told Comicbook.com, “I would love to see The Amazing Spider-Man 3.” “I think what was so wonderful was how Andrew was able to kind of make amends with the character and the studio, you know, to kind of win the general public back.”
