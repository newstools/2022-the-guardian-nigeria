Two persons were feared killed, yesterday, in a fatal accident at Nawfia, along the Awka-Enugu Expressway, in Anambra State. An eyewitness told The Guardian that the accident, which occurred around 2:20 p.m., involved a Mercedes 911 truck and a Toyota Highlander SUV. “The driver of the Highlander, who was moving towards Enugu, overtook wrongfully and nearly rammed into the truck heading towards Onitsha on a single lane. “The truck driver veered off the road, while trying to avoid the Highlander and fell on its side with two of his passengers trapped under it,” he said. Anambra State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Adeoye Irelewuyi, confirmed the incident, pointing out that two male adults died. While blaming the crash on wrongful overtaking, Irelewuyi commiserated with the deceased’ families, saying: “A fatal road traffic crash happened at Nawfia on the Awka-Enugu Expressway, yesterday, about 14:20hours. “The crash was between an unidentified commercial driver of a blue-black Mercedes 911 truck with registration number: AH 367 UWN and an unidentified driver of a private silver Toyota Highlander SUV marked: ACA 688 PX. “The crash involved four male adults, but two male adults, who were passengers of the truck were killed. The fatal crash was caused by wrong overtaking. We urge drivers to watch and ensure the road remain clear before overtaking.” He, however, said officers of the Awka Sector Command of FRSC were making attempts to remove the trapped bodies and clear obstruction caused on the highway. As of the time of filing this report, the deceased victims were still trapped under the truck.
