The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has set up a search and rescue centre in the state to increase safety on the waterways. To ensure the centre is adequately manned and responds timely to emergencies, about 17 staff of the marine department in the Lagos area office have been trained on how to activate, identify and direct safety ecology towards distressed crafts on the water. The NIWA Lagos search and rescue team members have been drilled on basic training on radio communication skills and how to use same to strategically network with crafts and other national emergency agencies as specified by International Maritime Organisation (IMO) whenever a save our soul (SoS) operational situation arises on water. Speaking during the training outing for the Lagos safety team and inauguration of the search and rescue center, the Area Manager, NIWA, Lagos, Sarat Lara Braimah, expressed appreciation to the Managing Director of the agency, Dr. George Moghalu, for approving and setting up the center, barely few weeks after unveiling navigational buoys to guide and roadmap safe water transportation in Lagos. While commending the General Manager, Marine, NIWA Headquarters, Joseph Ororo, she challenged the Lagos area office to brace up for the effective discharge of its mandate to stakeholders and sundry users of the critical busy Lagos waterways. Braimah further appealed to the Lagos rescue centre team to put all hands on deck as safety issues require deep interpretation, implementation and joint execution.
