The Nigerian Army (NA) has dismissed a report by an online medium alleging that personnel of the Nigerian army lamented the delay in payment of their January salary and that many soldiers were paid peanuts. The Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, in a statement on Friday, said the report was not only misleading but a grandiose attempt to incite personnel against established precept of discipline in the army. Nwachukwu said the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, had since assumption of command prioritised the welfare of officers, soldiers, and their families, including ensuring prompt payment of salaries, allowances, and all statutory entitlements. He said an allegation suggesting delay and non-implementation of new salary increase was a reckless falsehood in all its intent and purposes. According to him, it must be emphasised, that the Nigerian Army has over the years built a reputation and unbroken record of prompt payment of salaries and allowances. Nwachukwu said that officers and soldiers had always got their monthly salaries and allowances as and when due, adding that any envisaged delay is usually communicated to the troops through an internal communication mechanism. “It is, therefore, instructive to state that for the month of January, all salaries and allowances have been paid. “The attempt to stir up discontent and whip up the sentiment with regards to the unsubstantiated and baseless report that Generals feed fat is an outrageous frivolity. “It is an attempt to incite personnel against the institution and cause disaffection in the ranks and should therefore be discountenanced. “The NA wishes to call on all credible media to distance themselves from the apparent unprofessional and disgraceful yellow journalism practiced by some media channels and purveyors of fake of news. “Our troops are in high spirit and would not be distracted by any mischievous submission by agent provocateurs,” he said.
