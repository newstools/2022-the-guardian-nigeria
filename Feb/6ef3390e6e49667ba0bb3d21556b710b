Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has inaugurated its State Working Committee (SWC), led by a former member of the House of Representatives, Acho Obioma. Former state chairman of the party, Chief Donatus Nwankpa, handed over the party’s leadership to Obioma, yesterday, at the party Secretariat on Azikwe road, Umuahia, the state capital. Nwankpa said Obioma’ emergence, as the state chairman of the party, represented the wish of its members, adding that his reign marked the beginning of a new era in Abia APC. Nwankpa revealed that APC under his watch rose from obscurity to limelight, pointing out that only one man, who had refused to submit himself to the leadership of the party, could not hijack the party. He insisted that there is no faction in Abia APC, rather there is a part of the party that is loyal to the National Caretaker Chairman of the party, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State. In his acceptance speech, Obioma commended members of the party for the confidence reposed in him, stating that he would do the job to the best of his ability. He urged members of the party to hold regular meetings at the ward and council levels to strengthen their growth.He said: “Abia APC has discovered that all Abia residents want a change of the government in the state. We are determined to bring that change to the people of the state come 2023. “We are therefore soliciting the support of all and sundry to assist us in our quest to bring this change to Abia State.”
 State Publicity Secretary of the party, Mike Odoemena, told journalists that Obioma remained the authentic state chairman of the APC, while the Secretariat remained No.38 Azikwe Road, Umuahia.
