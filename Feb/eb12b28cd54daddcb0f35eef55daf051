Barely one week to the start of the 2022 Cadet and Junior Fencing Championship slated for Lagos, the African Fencing Confederation (AFC) has approved a fencing academy for Nigeria. The African championship, which is expected to feature over 200 participants from no fewer than 10 countries, will now hold at Festival Hotel, Festac Town, Lagos from February 23 to 27. It was initially billed for the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere. The Samray Fencing Academy, which becomes functional immediately after the championship, would help in accelerating the development of the sport in Nigeria, AFC said. According to the Confederation, potential Nigeria has to be among the leading forces in the sport in Africa necessitating the approval of the Samray Fencing academy. Expressing delight in the approval for the new academy, Nigerian Fencing Federation boss, Adeyinka Samuel, said the institute, which is an independent state-of-the-art facility, would play a major role in grooming world-class fencers from the country. “There are various benefits attached to the project as the academy is into partnerships with high ranking global schools across Europe, America and UAE, who are keen to partner with talented Nigerian fencers,” he said. He lauded the Lagos State Sports Commission and the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) for their support for the championship, while also expressing gratitude to its sponsors, including Interswitch, Stanbic IBTC, Levene Energy, Tap Tap Send, 2Sure, GB Foods, ALP Africa, FL Studio, Starlight Energy, Samray Group, Thrive Little Explorer and For the Future of Fencing (IChF).
