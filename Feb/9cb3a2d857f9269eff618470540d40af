With electricity consumers in Lagos State groaning under frequent black out, the Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has blamed it on low allocation of power received from the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).
   
It noted that, “the total current allocation of power supply from the TCN to the various power station in our network has dropped from 450MW to 156MW,”
 
EKEDC spokesperson, Godwin Idemudia, said cited the low allocation as the reason it has been unable to meet the supply demands of its customers recently.
