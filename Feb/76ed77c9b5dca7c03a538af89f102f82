• Tasks Eagles coaches on scouting gifted goalkeepers
Former Super Eagles Goalkeeper, Ike Shorunmu, has commended Mohamed Abou Gabal of Egypt and Edouard Mendy of Senegal for their outstanding displays, at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) final. Shorunmu said their heroics dragged the final game to the penalty shootout won by the Lions of Teranga. He added that the two stars’ displays proved that goalkeepers are critical members of a team, adding that Super Eagles will become a strong unit if the coaches invested time in searching for and training talented youths in the art of goalkeeping. Advising Nigerians against writing off current national team first choice goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye, who many blame for the country’s early exit from the AFCON, Shorunmu called on stakeholders to invest in the development of talented local goalkeepers. He noted that former Super Eagles goalkeepers, including Vincent Enyeama, himself, Peter Rufai and Alloy Agu, among others, who made the country proud in the past, were all discovered from the domestic league. “I must commend Egypt goalkeeper, who plays for Zamalek of Egypt and Mendy of Senegal and Chelsea for their exceptional performance in Cameroun. They deserve the awards given to them. Their performances should be a pointer to Eagles’ coaches that much priority need to be given to the goalkeeping department to build a complete team. “North Africans invest more in their league and that is why they produce quality goalkeepers. Nigeria should spend more on the NPFL to churn out quality football stars,” he said.
