NOKIA has announced two new Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) services in the areas of security and analytics, as part of its strategy to give communication service providers (CSPs) and enterprises a more flexible and cost effective way for servicing their customers, and operating and monetizing their networks, as advanced 5G services are rolled out. The new services follow Nokia’s recent launch into SaaS to help CSPs and enterprises accelerate the time to value what they realize from their services offering by shifting to an agile model based on software consumed purely on demand through a subscription, and away from customized software run on costly, complex, on-premise infrastructure. As opposed to classic SIMs, embedded SIM (eSIM) and integrated SIM (iSIM) technologies can store and manage multiple subscription profiles remotely for authenticating users and devices on mobile networks. iSIM Secure Connect gives control to automate the entire eSIM/iSIM management process and will open opportunities to monetize services linked to trusted digital identities. Nokia’s iSIM Secure Connect, through a SaaS delivery model, enables CSPs and enterprises to securely manage machine-to-machine and consumer device subscriptions for eSIM- and iSIM-enabled devices. As 5G network complexity has increased the need for advanced analytics, Nokia is strengthening its AVA offering with new SaaS capabilities based on NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function), part of 5G Standalone architecture.
