The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corp, Kebbi State Command, has paraded a 28-year-old Umar Mohammed of Diri, Yar Karau Village, Sakaba Local Council, for allegedly defiling an eight-year-old, Khadijat. Addressing journalists, yesterday, the State Commandant, Umar Musa Bala, said the suspect is a teacher at the NYSC Nursery and Primary School Diri, a school where Khadijat is a pupil. The suspect confessed to have lured the minor from her house into his room at about 10 am on the pretence of sending her on errand only to defile her in addition to offering her fifty-naira gift. It was khadijat’s younger brother, Abdulrahman, who narrated the where about of Khadijat to his mother, and the mother notified the men of the NSCDC at the Sakaba division, for further investigation. Mohammed confessed to the offence and a medical report from a state government hospital also confirmed there was a penetration. During the parade, the state commandant advised parents to be watchful and be observant of their wards against evil-minded people like Mohammed. He also urged the general public never to sweep any gender related offences under the carpet for religious, tribe and familiarity sentiments. He also called on civil society groups not to relent in sensitising Nigerians on the ills of the act, as it is repulsive, barbaric and animalistic.
