The Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Agency (NMDPRA) said it has suspended operations of four filling stations in Anambra State over purported delivery of adulterated fuel. Operations Controller of NMDPRA in Anambra State, Victor Orjiakor, disclosed this yesterday, in Awka, adding that samples of the product had been collected from the outlets for laboratory test and that in the meantime, they would not be allowed to sell the product to customers. Orjiakor said the surveillance checks suggested that the products delivered to the filling stations might have been lifted from the depots that received the ‘methanol contaminated’ PMS consignment, which came into country last month. He said the downstream sector in Anambra remained healthy and that there was no bad product in circulation in the state. “We track every truck coming into the state, because there is no NNPC depot facilities in Anambra. We verify every product coming in through Enugu and Aba depots and with that we were able to discover four stations that received suspected adulterated PMS,” he said. He condemned the artificial increase in the price of petrol, saying NMDPRA teams were on surveillance across the state to ensure that marketers sell fuel at the industry approved price of N162 and N165 per litre.
