On Tuesday, the rapper celebrated the release of his new album Donda 2, which comes after Donda released in August 2021. The Donda 2 performance experience held at the Loandepot Park saw appearances from The Game, Migos, Jack Harlow, Da Baby, Alicia Keys, Playboi Carti and more artists featured on the latest project. In his performance, West sampled a line from his estranged wife Kim Kardashian’s debut Saturday Night Live monologue back in October. At the beginning of Sci-Fi, the Kardashian’s voice can be heard saying, “I married the best rapper of all time. Not only that, he is the richest Black man in America. A talented, legit genius who gave me four incredible kids.” The stadium was pitch-black during the performance and at the centre of the stage stood a burning house surrounded by water which symbolized West’s childhood home in Chicago. Attendees at the event included Elon Musk, French Montana, and Rick Ross. Kanye revealed that the album would be released only on his Stem Player last week in a post of the song’s snippet. He wrote, “Donda 2 will only be available on my own platform, the Stem Player. Not on Apple Amazon Spotify or YouTube.” “Today artists get just 12% of the money the industry makes,” he claimed. “It’s time to free music from this oppressive system. It’s time to take control and build our own. Go to stemplayer.com now to order.” The Stem Plyer reveals that the $200 device “ships with Donda”, allowing users to “customize any song.” In another post, West wrote, “You can download new music from stemplayer.com. You can play 4 different elements of the track: vocals, drums, bass and music. It also has a MP3 player available.” Urging his followers to “go to stemplayer.com to be a part of the revolution.” Kanye first announced the release of Donda 2 in January, posting a photo of a burning house with the date Feb. 22, 2022, embellished over.
