We expect the former to persist as bargain-hunting activities are likely to continue.” The negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are, MTN Nigeria Communications (MTNN), Zenith Bank, Lafarge Africa, Nigerian Breweries and Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO). As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was negative as 33 stocks lost while 21 recorded price appreciation.
