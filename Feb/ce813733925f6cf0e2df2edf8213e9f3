A three-storey building located at the Akanbi Crescent, Yaba area of Lagos State, has collapsed. This comes a few months after the collapse of a 21-storey building that claimed the lives of 45 persons at Gerrard Road, Ikoyi area of the state. It was gathered that a section of the building which is still under construction collapsed on another building beside it. While the cause of the collapse and the number of casualties was unknown as at the time of filing this report, an eyewitness who spoke with the media said a part of the building had collapsed last year. She disclosed that the construction went ahead despite the collapse as no authority from the Lagos State government weighed into the matter. When contacted, Director-General (DG), Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Oluwafemi Oke-Osanyitolu, told The Guardian that the agency was working to rescue people who may be trapped in the rubble
