President Muhammadu Buhari is desirous of assenting the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, his Senior Special Assistant National Assembly Matters (Senate), Babajide Omoworare, has said. Omoworare stated this in Abuja, yesterday, during a discussion organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), in collaboration with Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD). The policy dialogue centred on ‘Electoral Bill 2021 and Quest for Presidential Assent: Matters Arising’. The National Assembly had on Monday, January 31, transmitted the reworked bill to the President for assent. Omoworare said consultations were ongoing by the President, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and other stakeholders to assent the bill. He said: “I have it on good authority that the Attorney General is deliberating with him at the moment and it is not just the Attorney General. “For every bill that comes to the President, he consults before deciding to assent or withhold his assent with reasons in furtherance of the provision of the Constitution. “We are aware that in spite of the fact that the President needs 30 days under Section 58 to sign, the President is desirous of signing it.”
