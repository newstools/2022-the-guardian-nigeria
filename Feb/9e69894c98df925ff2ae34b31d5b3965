When the Super Eagles won all three group matches in the yet to be concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun, the team suddenly assumed the role of ‘landlord’ of Garoua, a quiet city in northern Cameroun.  But everything changed in the round of 16, when Tunisia defeated Nigeria.
 
Soon after the Senegalese referee sounded his whistle to end the match, Tunisian journalists invaded the media centre singing and dancing to mock Nigerians. “We are the new landlords of Garoua, we are the champions.” However, on Saturday, the Tunisians were served the same bitter pills by Burkina Faso. As they did to the Super Eagles, it took 19-year-old Dango Quattara’s lone strike in first half stoppage time to send the Tunisians to early bed.  Tunisians wore long faces, as they filed out of Stade Roumdi Adjia on Saturday night. 
 
“We have seen the other side of Garoua,” one of the Tunisian journalists said in his response to a message from The Guardian. “It’s so sad we couldn’t make it to the semifinals. I don’t know why our team can’t find an answer to this problem.  This is not the first or second time Burkina Faso will stop us in the quarterfinals. We wish Burkina Faso the best of luck.”
 
Quattara was initially shown a yellow card for a blatant foul 10 minutes from time. VAR intervened, though, and the referee was told to change his mind and the teenager was sent off.
 
The quarterfinals between Burkina Faso and Tunisia was the last game played in Garoua in this 33rd Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun.
