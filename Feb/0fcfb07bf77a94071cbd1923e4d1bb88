Impending review of the premium currently paid on vehicle insurance in Nigeria appears necessary after some 18 years gap. But an upward adjustment solely for an increase in revenue puts the cart before the horse. While the proposed 50 per cent jack up in third-party premium aims to bring the operators more income and cushion inflation rate effects, it again overlooks a mammoth of uninsured vehicles – the main reason operators are poor and the insurance undertaking ineffective. For equity purposes, better energy should be dissipated at bringing violators into the net than overburdening law-abiding citizens with adjusted rates.  When the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) approved the N5000 minimum threshold for vehicle insurance in 2004, it had in mind a well-reimbursed functional scheme that leaves no complaints about the operators. The third-party minimum rate was a 400 per cent spike in N1000 erstwhile paid and left the vehicle owners largely unhappy. The operators are supposed to be the happier of the divide, but 18 years down the line, with inflation pushing up the cost of repairs astronomically, the operators are already walking the tight ropes of review and another upward adjustment in rates.
