The  Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it plans to review the performance  and functionalities of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS ) during the Saturday’s FCT Area Council Poll. Mr Yahaya Bello, the FCT INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner(REC) said this when he spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja. Bello said that the commission had observed challenges faced by voters due to non functionality of the BVAS and was working to address them. “Equally, there was also the misunderstanding  about what to do with the BVAS. “The election is the only Area Council Election in this country that is being   conducted by INEC  and it invested heavily in the preparation for the election. “We have Registration Area Centre Techniciains trained in order to respond  to any malfunctioning of the BVAS  and provided transportation for them for swift response,” he said. Bello said that six INEC Resident Electoral Commissioners and three National Commissioners were drafted to the  election to ensure it success. “We have upcoming elections, so between now and then the issues would be looked into to avoid future challenges.
