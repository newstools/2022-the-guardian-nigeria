Everything about nails is fascinating, from the endless design ideas to various colour shades. If there is one fashion trend that has been growing rapidly in the last few decades, it has to be the different types of artistic nail designs being introduced to the beauty market. It’s almost like there is an underground bunker where a group of nail experts work 24/7 to invent new ways for nails to be worn. However, despite the incredible designs of nails, it is always important to bear in mind that a nail colour choice can either make or destroy a nail design. Before a manicure, a lady needs to have the right information to make an accurate selection. In this article, we have provided a list of five nail colours every lady needs to try out. And by colours, we are not referring to the cliché colours like black and nude, we are talking about fashion-forward colours that will make you stand out, leave everyone gagged, and position you as a fashion must watch. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1665089 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica-478x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1600" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica-478x598.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica-192x240.jpg 192w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica-384x480.jpg 384w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica-480x600.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Yellow-nails-by-NailsbyOddica.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Often described as the unsung hero of the nail polish industry, most women tend to quickly dismiss the idea of using this colour, preferring cliché colours like nude and black. The versatility of yellow is astonishing as it is suitable for nail designs ranging from French tips to asymmetrical clouds. With the various shades it offers, it adds that extra pop of colour to the hands, and elevates the look of its wearer into a chic and sophisticated appearance. So, when next you go for a manicure, and the nail technician asks what colour you prefer, don’t waste time to say, “Yellow, please.” Neon green Want to step up your nail game? Look no further because Neon green got you covered. Nothing screams bold, energetic, colourful, and fun better than the Neon green nail polish. Wearing Neon green is a subtle way of informing everyone that you are a risk-taker and trendsetter.

With these designs, your fingernails are sure to be the centre of attraction. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1665091 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-593x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1292" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-593x598.jpg 593w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-58x58.jpg 58w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-116x116.jpg 116w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-238x240.jpg 238w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-476x480.jpg 476w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails.-594x600.jpg 594w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Orange-nails..jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> A fresh look shouldn’t appear on your face only, your nails also deserve the amazing treat.

Is that a 00’s nail trend I see emerging from the shadows into the limelight? White nail paints have been around for over a decade, and while the trend dissolved, it’s back and this time, it’s proving to be more than just white. Designing white nails is very fun since it goes so well with accessory pieces like pearls, stones, gold. It is also a great canvas for patterns, polka dots, and other mini-illustrations.
With beautifully designed white nails, your hands are sure to be a work of art; which might someday be displayed alongside artworks from the likes of Picasso.
