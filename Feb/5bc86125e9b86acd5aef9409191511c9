At least, 222 Lagos State Public Service pensioners who retired between 2018 and 2020 have received their benefits of over N1 billion under the contributory pension scheme. The Director-General, Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC), Babalola Obilana, said this at the 91st batch retirement bond certificate presentation programme in Lagos, reassuring retirees that contributions had been remitted into their retirement savings accounts (RSAs). He said despite challenges, the state government has continued monthly payments as a priority to ensure retirees access their benefits as soon as possible. He said “LASPEC also constantly reviews its business processes to ensure first-class service delivery to retirees and accomplish the governor’s goal of the immediate payment of pension entitlements upon retirement,” he said. Obilana confirmed that before the payment, there were over 1000 retirees that had not received their contributions due to documentation errors. He assured me that the backlog would be cleared before the end of this administration. One of the beneficiaries, Jane Adakwu Ndukuba, in an interview shortly after the event, said that the state government was trying as she did not expect that she would be collecting her certificate so soon. “I have just collected my certificate and I feel very happy. I urge those who have not collected to exercise patience. Lagos is doing very well,” she said.
