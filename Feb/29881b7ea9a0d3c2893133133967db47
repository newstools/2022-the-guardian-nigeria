Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson has been passed fit to travel to Italy for the first leg of the club’s last-16 Champions League tie at Inter Milan on Wednesday. The midfielder was injured in Sunday’s Premier League win at Burnley and was substituted early in the second half. But he was involved during team training on Tuesday and is set to fly out to Italy with the rest of the squad. “Hendo is fine,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said on Tuesday. “He got a knock on his knee and today was second-day recovery for a lot of players like for him as well, so it was not the longest session for him. “But apart from that, there are no issues really. The knee in the game was definitely not comfortable, it’s a proper wound, you can really see it — it should not be there. Apart from that, he is fine.”
