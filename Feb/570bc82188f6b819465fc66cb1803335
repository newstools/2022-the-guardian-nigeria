Nick, 29, and Priyanka announced the arrival of their child in a statement posted to their Instagram accounts on Friday, January 21. “We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate. We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family. Thank you so much (heart emoji).” Mandatory Credit: Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/REX/Shutterstock (10118766ck)<br />Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas. Priyanka Chopra, left, and Nick Jonas arrive at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party, in Beverly Hills, Calif<br />91st Academy Awards – Vanity Fair Oscar Party, Beverly Hills, USA – 24 Feb 2019 Neither the sex of the child nor the name was mentioned. Reports allege that the duo welcomed a baby girl that was born in a Southern California hospital on Saturday. Priyanka has been very vocal on countless occasions about her and her husband’s desire to have children. In an interview, the former Miss India said: “I do want children, as many as I can have.” Priyanka has insisted that starting a family with her partner Nick Jonas will occur when the time is right and will ‘‘slow down’’ when they eventually become parents. The couple both decided it is important to focus totally on their future child when they do become parents. She added: ‘‘I’m okay with that. We’re both okay with that.’’ Nick also articulated his wish for children in an interview with E! News last year, but said Priyanka’s happiness was his number one priority. ‘‘She is the most important piece of the puzzle, and it’s obviously something we hope happens, and god willing, it comes together,’ Nick told the site. ‘You know, whatever is right. We’re blessed to have each other and have a full heart for the future, I say, and things are out of your control. And the foundation of a couple is strong, and you’re excited about the possibility of that.’’ The news of welcoming a baby by the couple comes as a shock as there was no prior information that they were expecting a child. Before the announcement of welcoming their baby, the Baywatch star had been all about the ‘next job’, she says, ‘‘My priority has always been the next job. I’m a very, very ambitious person. But I think the woman in me is craving balance. I’m craving my family life. I’m craving being able to do things for the soul that I didn’t do because I was just ‘blinders on’ and working.’’ He added that he hoped “for many, or whatever that is.”
