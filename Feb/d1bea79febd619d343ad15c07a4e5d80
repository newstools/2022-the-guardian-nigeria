MTN, Africa’s telecom giant, has embarked on a major rebrand and repositioning, scheduled to take place on February 27.The revamp exercise will see MTN’s logo refreshed and simplified with its “Everywhere You Go” tagline changed to ‘Yello’.
 
According to MTN, the new logo sees ‘MTN’ written in normal block letters and in blue with an oval of the same colour around it, while the yellow background seems to be a lighter shade of yellow than the older logo.
 
MTN Chief Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Officer, Nompilo Morafo, said the new look aligns with the group’s evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company.
 
“Our commitment and focus to accelerate Africa’s progress sees MTN revealing a refreshed brand identity and campaign from February 27,” Morafo said. The new logo has been submitted to the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC) for approval as can be seen outside MTN’s offices near the 14th Avenue Offramp to the N1 Freeway in Johannesburg. The rebrand will be group-wide, and not just outside MTN’s Johannesburg headquarters, according to the telecom giant.
