LWD Photo Pinterest When it comes to accessories, my pick is sparkle and shine, so pearls, gold plated jewellery, and even some silver-plated ones are a top pick for me. Anything statement works, really. Make it even more classy for sleeveless dresses by wearing a ribbed long-sleeve turtleneck and embellish your knee-length dresses with fleece-lined tights. Don’t forget a scarf where necessary; even if you use it as a belt, still scarf things up a little. Play as much as you want with your makeup when styling a little white dress, especially your lip colour. My personal favourite is a bold red lip, but you can try whatever colours you like as long as it compliments your outfit.
