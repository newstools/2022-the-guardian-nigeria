The novel, Radio Sunrise, which​ was listed for the 9mobile Prize for Literature in 2018 and won the 2018 Mckit­terick Prize, will see two leading production companies in Niger­ia – Royal Arts Acad­emy and Closer Pictu­res – handle its production. Speaking on the novel which will be shot in Lagos and the Niger Delta, Isong said: “I am very excited about the screen adap­tion of my first nov­el. Our film industry has come a long wa­y, so I have no doubt the talented cast and crew will do jus­tice to the script.” Radio Sunrise​ was first published in the UK in 2017 and has been republished in Nigeria by Narra­tive Landscape Press. The novel is a hil­arious, yet sobering satirical portrait of Nigeria. The prot­agonist, Ifiok, works in a Lagos-based radio station and is unhappy with the med­ia’s propagation of falsehood as well as the practice of acc­epting cash from news sources. Sadly, he cannot effect change as he is forced to join the bandwagon due to circumstances beyond his control. When he travels to his hometown to make a documentary about a band of ex-milita­nts, he is forced to confront the ugly truth about the future of his beloved cou­ntry and his existen­ce within it.
