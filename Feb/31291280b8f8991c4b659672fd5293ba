Nine-time African champions, Super Falcons of Nigeria, yesterday defeated the Lady Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire 2-0 in the first leg of their 2022 African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) qualifier match. Super Falcons celebrate victory  The centre referee disallowed what could have been the first goal by Super Falcons in the 13th minute and gave a free-kick instead. However, in the 21st minute, Esther Okoronkwo set up Ifeoma Onumonu inside the box to fire the Super Falcons in front from close range. Onumonu bagged a brace in the 56th minute of the second half, as she lobbed the ball over the Ivorian goalkeeper to double the lead of the Super Falcons. Former England youth international, Ashleigh Plumptre, made her international debut for Nigeria in the encounter. The Super Falcons, who are nine-time African champions, managed to beat the Black Queens of Ghana 2-1 to get to the final stage of the qualifiers, while the Lady Elephants outscored the Niger Republic 20-0.
