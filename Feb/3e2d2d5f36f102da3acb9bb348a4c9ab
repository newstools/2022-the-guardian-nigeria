Sparkle, one of the top five global operators, has been selected by Ciudad, one of Africa’s fastest-growing telecommunications companies, to raise Internet speed and set the record of the highest super blazing experience in Nigeria with a 10Gbps port connection.
   
Operating as OneData Nigeria, Ciudad is an alternative, fast growing Internet Service Provider (ISP) with approximately 300 subscribers and market presence in six cities in Nigeria. By 2025, Ciudad plans to become one of the top 10 broadband service providers in the country.
   
By connecting through the local PoP in Lagos with Sparkle’s global IP Transit backbone Seabone, the first Tier-1 International backbone in Africa, Ciudad gains low latency and high-speed access to the global Internet.  “Thanks to our years of experience as an Internet service provider, existing networks and capacity are being expanded and consolidated, more Internet speed and capacity are being made available, and new households are being opened up.
   
“It is our declared goal to provide stable and high-speed Internet connectivityto the residential Nigerian customers through our FTTH infrastructure and enterprise customers in order to further expand our role as one of the leading broadband providers.”
  
“For our customers this means that they can rely on a very fast, stable fibre-optic cable internet and have access to Internet contents at very competitive rates in the industry.”
