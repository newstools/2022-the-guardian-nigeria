Ahead of the 2023 presidential elections, South East chapter of the Atiku Kawai Media Group has said former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has the best credentials to proffer solutions to the various challenges in the country. The group stated this at the South East pre-town hall meeting in Enugu while sensitising Igbo people and others on the need to support Atiku in the 2023 presidential elections. In a statement issued, yesterday, by its Acting Zonal Director, NwaJesu Anthony Onyekuru, the group said it was time to rescue the country and set it on the path of development. “We believe Atiku is capable of resolving the various issues plaguing us as a people and as a country. What you see today is just a test run of what will come, because we are fully ready,” he said. Facilitator of the event, Okezie Amujiogu, said: “We are here to show that we are ready to support Atiku for the 2023 general election and we will mobilise our people in the South East for his presidency.”
