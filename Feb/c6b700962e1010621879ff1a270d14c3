Spotlight-stealing attire with a joyous mood is taking over, from prints to voluminous silhouettes like puff sleeve dresses, volume tops and cutouts. Accessories are in on the fun, too. Think chunky platforms, lengthier straps and a more-is-more aesthetic.
Ahead, a deeper dive into the fashion trends we are predicting will be big in 2022. We know, we know—animal prints aren’t exactly anything new, but this trend is timeless and ever-evolving. For 2022, we are trading in leopard and snakeskin for zebra prints, tiger prints, and Ankara prints. It’s undeniable that there’s a flirty feeling in the air, and our style choices are definitely reflecting it. If 2022 will prove one thing, it is that skin is still in.
Cutouts aren’t all about sex appeal like they were when this trend spiked a few years back; this time around, they’re intriguing and “unexpectedly-placed,” so lean into this trend. From oversized shirting to ballooned silhouettes and a continuation of the puff sleeve trend, dresses and tops retain their volume in 2022. Rock that oversized T-shirt you’ve been eyeing, throw on some shorts and heels and feel confident in the sexiest of silhouettes. From sky-high heels to platforms, ankle-strap heels, boots, even clogs and crocs, platform shoes are amped up for the year 2022. So, go ahead and give your micro-heels a break — 2022 is all about chunky soles.
