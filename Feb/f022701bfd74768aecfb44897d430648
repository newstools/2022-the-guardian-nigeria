Sir: Allow me space to congratulate the widow, brothers, sisters, children and relatives of the former Lagos State governor and dean of Nigerian journalism, Alhaji Lateef Jakande on the establishment of a Foundation in the name of the erstwhile statesman. I hasten to add that he deserves it.
 
While at the Nigerian Tribune and he was its Managing Director and Editor in Chief, I worked closely with him receiving editorials he dictated from Lagos to me at the Imalefalafia headquarters, Ibadan. He was a man of great learning whom I imitated. But he deserves more from the Lagos State government. Establishing the Lagos State University like Ambrose Alli in Edo, Adekunle Ajasin in Ondo and Olabisi Onabanjo in Ogun State, Jakande ought to be honoured with a university named for him like those of his gubernatorial contemporaries. If not LASU, at least one of the new Lagos State universities ought to be named for him or a Jakande School of Government, an area where he excelled above his peers.
 
In spite of poor performance in governance by most Nigerian leaders, it is important to honour those that have given their best to the masses like Jakande and Moshood Abiola. Bayo Ogunmupe wrote from Isolo, Lagos.
