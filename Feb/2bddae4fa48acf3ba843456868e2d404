 Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom. Former NBA superstar Lamar Odom is clearly not over Khloe Kardashian after revealing that he misses his ex-wife “so much” and is still dreaming about her. ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ cameras captured Odom’s revelation while he was making his bed on the reality TV show, with Odom repeatedly telling his housemate, choreographer Todrick Hall, that he thinks about Khloe often. “I had some good dreams last night,” Odom can be heard telling Hall in the footage. “I dreamt about my ex-wife last night.” “I miss her so much,” Odom continued. “I wish I could take that time back … I miss her so much.” The 42-year-old former Los Angeles Lakers forward who won back-to-back NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010 and was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2011, married Khloe back in 2009, but the two were divorced just a few years later. Since their split, Khloe has had a daughter named True with the controversial Tristan Thompson, while Odom attempted to move on from the Kardashian by getting engaged to health and lifestyle coach Sabrina Parr in November 2019. The wedding was called off one year later.
