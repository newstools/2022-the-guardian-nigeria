Music superstar Beyoncé has for the first time ever been nominated for an Academy Award after scoring a nomination for Best Original Song for “Be Alive,” which accompanied the film King Richard. King Richard is also in the running for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Aunjanue Ellis), Original Screenplay, and Editing awards. The track by Beyoncé, who already has a record-breaking number of Grammy wins, is an inspirational anthem featuring soaring harmonies, an uplifting message, and Beyoncé’s signature powerhouse vocals, making it the perfect match for the drama, which follows the rise of young Venus and Serena Williams under the guidance of their father and coach, Richard Williams. The Williams sisters first announced the surprise new song in October, when the trailer for King Richard was released. Beyoncé was previously expected to earn a nomination for the 2020 Oscars after she released the bold original song “Spirit” that accompanied the live-action Lion King. However, she was snubbed. Now that she’s finally in the running for an Oscar gong, she’ll be competing against Van Morrison (“Down to Joy,” Belfast), and Diane Warren (“Somehow You Do,” Four Good Days), Lin-Manuel Miranda (“Dos Oruguitas,” Encanto), and Billie Eilish and Finneas (“No Time to Die,” No Time to Die). The 2022 Oscar ceremony will be on Sunday, March 27, 2022.
