To address unemployment challenges in the country, United Way Greater Nigeria has graduated the first cohort of its skills to employment programme. Indeed, 43 beneficiaries between the ages of 18 – 30 graduated from the training. The training, which was held for a total of three months, included an internship period of four weeks, after eight weeks of training. Participants were trained in digital skills such as, digital marketing, front-end web development and graphics design. The programme designed and conceptualised by United Way Greater Nigeria is aimed at bridging the unemployment and underemployment gap among a teeming young population. Beneficiaries will take advantage of the rising demand for digital skills in the Nigerian economy, to become gainfully employed or self employed. Of the 43 graduates, there were 24 females and 19 males. A total of 27 Digital Marketers, eight Front-end web developers and eight Graphics Designers benefited. UWGN commended all implementing partners involved in the success of this program. “We are indeed grateful to Nerdy Eye, WAVE Academies, Educate Nigeria, The Workplace Centre, JASS Academy and Sweet Sensation for partnering with us to bring about social impact in the lives of these youths. “For subsequent cohorts, we plan to expand the program to reach even more youths and the process to identify more donors to fund a more expanded program is already ongoing”, it added.
