• Mafab Communications gets February 24 to make payment
• Dark cloud over licensee’s ability to meet the deadline
• FG at liberty to do what it pleases with earnings, says expert If Mafab Communications meets the February 24 deadline for the payment of the $273.6 million (N113.5 billion) 5G-auction fee, the Federal Government could get temporary relief from its revenue challenges, as an additional $557.2 million (N231.2 billion) would have been remitted to government’s coffers from the licensing regime.  The company also holds an operational interest in the banking, insurance, hospitality and telecommunication spheres of the Nigerian economy.
  
According to the information gathered, Mafab Communications has set a five-year target, which would see it deploy into over 6,000 sites in the country. In the first year of deployment, Mafab is targeting 1.5 million subscriber growth from 1000 sites rollout; to increase to three million from 3000 sites by year two.  In August 2021, NCC had disclosed it exceeded its N36 billion-projected revenue from spectrum license fees for 2021, having recorded over N150 billion from this revenue source within the five months of the year.
  
The figure, according to the Commission, represented over 400 per cent increase in revenue budget performance in respect of spectrum fees generated by the Commission between January 1 and May 31, 2021, reflecting a significant contribution to the revenue drive of the Federal Government.
   
NCC, however, stated that the N150 billion spectrum revenue achieved in the first half of the year has been remitted to the Federal Government in line with the provisions of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA), 2003, which mandates it to remit proceeds from spectrum resources wholly into the government’s Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF).
