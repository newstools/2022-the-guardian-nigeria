A fierce gun duel between the police and enemies of the state has left five suspected terrorists dead in Matazu local council of Katsina State. The incident occurred last Thursday when the terrorists attacked Kuru and Dangani communities in the council area. Speaking yesterday while parading 13 suspects arrested mostly for terrorism related crimes at the State Police Command headquarters, its spokesperson, SP Gambo Isah, said the terrorists rustled 81 cows, 54 sheep and a donkey. The police spokesperson said the terrorists also kidnapped a 62-year-old man simply identified as Alhaji Sule. He, however, added the operatives later recovered all the rustled animals and rescued Sule. The operatives also recovered a white colour Golf ‘3’ car with registration number Katsina: BKR 367 XA from the terrorists. The recovered vehicle was displayed during the parade of the suspects. He lamented that terrorists had upped their ante and were using vehicles rather than motorcycles in carrying out attacks. “From our recent encounters with terrorists, we discovered that they have changed their modus operandi. “They now use vehicles to attack instead of motorcycles which they used to operate with. “Apart from the Golf car we recovered from them during yesterday’s (Thursday) operation, the terrorists also used a J5 and a Sharon in last Wednesday’s operation in Jibiya where we lost our gallant DPO for the area. “We are however ready for them, notwithstanding any strategy they come up with,” Isah added. The spokesperson said the suspects would be arraigned in court soon as investigations were completed.
