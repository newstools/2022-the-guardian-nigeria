Bola Ahmed Tinubu is certainly one of the most talked-about politicians of our time. His friends and detractors are generally in the extreme edges of the ropes. For his friends, he is a messiah and redeemer and a person worthy of being defended with the last pint of blood. This is not unexpected because rarely would you come across anyone who had been Tinubu’s follower or loyalist and had not derived a direct or remote benefit from the friendship. He rarely forgets his followers or leaves them behind in the race of life.  The concern here is not fixed on the latter because “Judas Iscariot also has a reason for betraying Jesus Christ” but on the ignoramus, the halfwits and the clod who peddle falsity in a market populated by cretinous creatures. Those who would say it almost convincingly even when it is obvious that it is not true. Like those who would say “Bola Tinubu did not attend the Chicago State University” when all that they needed to do is to verify the fact from the registry of that university. The aforementioned categories of people have an axe to grind with Bola Tinubu on several fronts that are based on hatred, sheer sentiments and political adventurism. As for the confusion between Chicago State University and the University of Chicago, we cannot continue to dwell on that to the extent of losing the good values that Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu could offer Nigeria because even right in our own country highly educated people confuse the University of Lagos with the Lagos State University. The question is: “Does Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu possess a degree from a Chicago University?” Yes, he does. This case has been closed by a court of competent jurisdiction in Nigeria and whoever wants to stay on it has the freedom at his disposal.  Professor Ojikutu is of the Faculty of Management Sciences, University of Lagos.
