Super Eagles interim head coach at the just concluded Africa Cup of Nations, Augustine Eguavoen, looks primed to get the Nigerian national team’s job on a permanent basis after Amaju Pinnick, the president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), disclosed that he has told Portuguese-born coach Jose Peseiro he is free to take another job. The NFF named Peseiro as Super Eagles’ head coach last December following the sack of Gernot Rohr with the 61-year-old former Venezuela boss expected to take over after the AFCON and lead out the Super Eagles in next month’s two-legged 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ghana. However, Eguavoen, despite the Super Eagles’ exit in the second round of the AFCON, put himself in the frame to get the job on a permanent basis following the team’s impressive showing in three out of four games in Cameroon. Pinnick has now confirmed that the NFF is yet to officially sign a contract with Peseiro and has all but suggested that Eguavoen, a former skipper of the Nigerian national team, will take full charge of the Super Eagles in the upcoming double-header against Nigeria’s fierce West African rivals. “I am still talking to him [Jose Peseiro], maybe he has to wait till after the World Cup qualifiers [against Ghana],” Pinnick told Nigeria’s Channels Television. “If in the course of his waiting, he gets another job, we wish him well. “The good news is that we did not sign the contract officially. We don’t want to rush and make a hasty decision considering the circumstances.” He added: “We have to do what is best for the nation. And we work in harmony with the sports ministry, which represents the government.”
