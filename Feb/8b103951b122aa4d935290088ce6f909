The senator representing Abia South and Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe has said the new amended electoral law will curb rigging. He spoke, yesterday, when The Guardian sought his reaction on the new Act, saying with Section 84 of the Electoral Act providing for electronic voting and transmission of results, election rigging has been put under lock and key. Abaribe, a fourth term senator of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who has declared to contest the governorship election next year, observed that for any political party to now win election, the party must present candidates that are acceptable and not those with capacity to rig election. He urged PDP to choose him as its flag-bearer for the 2023 Abia governorship election because he has capacity to win elections, hinging PDP’s loss of the 2015 presidential election on complacency, despite everything to win was on its side. “I have  the requisite capacity, experience and knowledge to govern Abia, hence our party ought to present me as its right candidate and not take things for granted believing  that being the ruling party in the state, any candidate it presents would win.”
