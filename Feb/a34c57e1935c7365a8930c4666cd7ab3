Enugu State chapter of the Zikist-Buhari-Movement (ZBM) has commended the Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for uniting factions of the party in the state. It also commended the committee for withholding the Certificate of Return meant for the state chapter. Chief Ugochukwu Agballah, who claimed to have emerged from the state congress of the party held last year, had stepped out to receive the certificate, but the national leadership of the party stopped him from collecting it. In a statement issued by the state Publicity Secretary of ZBM, Victor Nwankwo, the group described the CECPC’s action as a milestone in uniting APC in Enugu State and stopping alleged imposition by Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma. It, therefore, appealed to Buni and the CECPC not to succumb to Uzodimma’s lobbying to impose Agballah on the state chapter of the party. Meanwhile, the forum of the APC chairmanship candidates for the Enugu State 2022 council election had in a letter to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Alkali Usman Baba, accused Agballah of forging documents of his membership of the party.
