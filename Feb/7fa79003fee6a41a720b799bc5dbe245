Exactly two weeks after the disbandment of its anti-vandal team in Rivers State over allegation by the state government that the team has been aiding and abetting illegal bunkering, Commandant General of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, (NSCDC), Dr. Ahmed Audi, has ordered the restructuring and sanitising of its command in Rivers State. He gave the order while receiving the report of the investigative committee set up to look into the allegations by the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, against some personnel said to be aiding and abetting suspected illegal dealers in petroleum products. In a communiqué issued yesterday in Abuja, Audi said the move is to ensure effective service delivery and optimal performance in furtherance of his earlier assurance to restructure and reconstitute the anti-vandal unit of Rivers State command with a view to prioritising the safety and protection of critical national assets and infrastructure as well as putting an end to attacks and wanton vandalism. The CG said: “NSCDC, as the lead agency in safeguarding all critical national assets and infrastructure in Nigeria, is poised to put in place a robust response and coordination system that guarantees safety and formidability of the country as Africa’s largest economy and leading oil exporter with the largest natural gas reserves.” According to the communique, the committee headed by Acting Deputy Commandant General, (DCG), operations, Mohammed Haruna, from the national headquarters in Abuja, conducted an on the spot assessment of different locations in Rivers State, including the NSCDC jetty and the exhibit yard where all impounded oil tankers, drums of illegally refined products, barges and boats were kept. Audi decried the action of some bad eggs within the corps in various formations and gave stern warning to all heads of anti-vandal units to refrain from any form of compromise, charging them to be more committed, purposeful and patriotic in fulfilling the mandates of the Corps without prejudice. “Henceforth, a telescopic monitoring would be launched on the activities of the anti-vandal squads in all formations and anyone not living up to expectation would be shown the way out immediately. You must wake up from your slumber to arrest and prosecute vandals and criminals,” Audi said A new head of the anti-vandal unit in the agency has been appointed while the commandant of the Rivers State anti-vandal unit has also been replaced in a bid to ensure transparency efficiency in the corps.
