Former first lady and wife of immediate past president, Dame Patience Jonathan, has sent a protest letter to Bayelsa State Police Command over the alleged illegal demolition of a section of her property, Aridolf Resort Wellness and Spa, located at Okaka area of the state capital. The former Secretary to the State Government (SSG) and Chairman of the State Physical Planning and Development Board, Gideon Ekeowe, led the demolition by state government officials. The former Nigerian first lady, in her protest letter to the Police, demanded the arrest of Ekeowe, over what she termed abuse of office, criminal demolition and abuse of court processes. It was gathered, yesterday, that the demand for the arrest of Ekeowe was provoked by the destruction of the hotel’s fence without allowing the management of the hotel and the Police respond to the court order arising from the motion on notice instituted by the physical planning board. A source within the board, confirmed to newsmen that the protest by the former first lady was creating uproar and the State Governor, Senator Douye Diri seems to have washed away his hands off the action of the Physical Planning and Development Board. It was learnt that such independent decision from Ekeowe has led to over 78 cases of illegal demolition against the board While some officials of the board claimed that the action of the chairman was personal and borne out of past political angst against the former first family, others claimed it was based on misunderstanding. It was also indicated that another property located in Otiotio, which belong to the first lady family, was also allegedly demolished illegally. Attempts to get the Chairman of the Physical Planning and Development Board to speak on the issues were not successful, as he could not be reached. But officials close to Ekeowe said the action of the physical planning officials was backed by the ruling of the Physical Planning Tribunal Development tribunal headed by Justice Emmanuel Ogola (rtd).
