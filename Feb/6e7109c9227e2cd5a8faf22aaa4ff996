After several hours of searching and retracing your purchase decisions, reality dawns that the theory of the bank secretly stealing from you was incorrect, and you spent every single penny. You accept your fate and map out a plan on how to sustain yourself with the remaining quarter. This is when you are introduced to the legendary SAPA. Sapa; the worst fear and greatest enemy of many Nigerians. It’s a time when an individual is forced to cut costs, develop a 001 eating formula, and sometimes call that obnoxious aunty/uncle to request money. While the famous month of Sapa, January might be over, it doesn’t mean the season of Sapa is no longer upon us. Experiencing Sapa happens to many Nigerians, which is why it’s important for every individual to possess the right information on surviving it. In this article, we provide you, our amazing readers five ways to survive Sapa.  NO SKINCARE PRODUCTS Say goodbye to buying skincare products, and hello to allowing nature to give you that beautiful and fresh skin you always wanted. The reality is while skincare products make your skin glow, they are also very expensive. Sometimes, the total amount of buying skincare products in a month is enough to pay Nepa bill for an entire year. However, if you are the kind of person who needs that extra ‘huh’ to make your skin pop, then homemade skincare is an alternative; it’s cheaper and more effective.

While buying food from eateries or online vendors seems convenient, it drains the pocket a lot. Invest in buying food stuffs and preparing meals yourself; it really helps in saving money to a certain extent and creates room for food experiment. Now, many of you might give the excuse of not knowing how to cook, remember YouTube and Google are your best friends. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1155642 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Meals-prepared-by-Spices-and-Herbs.-Photo-Pinterest-800x598.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="598" /> STAY INDOORS Sapa season is not an ideal time for you attend to that sister’s daughter’s friend’s naming ceremony, or that friend’s auntie’s uncle’s wedding. It’s a time for you to sit down in your house and binge watch a few movies or series. Always bear it in mind that going out is costly, because there are a few things it requires cash for like transportation, buying a gift/ticket, and miscellaneous. Point is BE AN OMO GET INSIDE THIS SEASON.  THRIFT CLOTHES There is a popular saying, fake it till you make it. You definitely don’t want your haters to know about your money problems, so, what better way to confuse them than wearing fashionable clothes. And by clothes, we are not referring to the ones bought from boutiques but places like Yaba and Oshodi market. #BEND DOWN SELECT ALL THE WAY.  SOCIAL MEDIA BREAK Data should be the least of your worries during Sapa season, which is why you need to take a break from social media. Taking a break helps in two ways; a) You stop spending money buying data, b) You are not exposed to the bad and bougie expensive lifestyle of your friends and celebrities. It also allows you to reflect and develop a plan to completely avoid Sapa the next month. Remember there are two people during Sapa season; the survivors and the ones who give up. Which one are you?
