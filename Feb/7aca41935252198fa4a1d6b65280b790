Speaking on the latest episode of the River Café Table 4 podcast, the footballer revealed that Victoria has always eaten grilled fish and steamed vegetables since they met in the late 1990s. He said, “I get quite emotional about food and wine; when I’m eating something great, I want everyone to try it.” “Unfortunately, I’m married to someone that has eaten the same thing for the last 25 years! Since I met Victoria, she only eats grilled fish, steamed vegetables,” “She will very rarely deviate away from that “, he continued to Ruthie Rogers. David also cited one of the few times the Spice Girl switched things up; he said, “The only time she’s probably ever shared something that’s been on my plate was actually when she was pregnant with [our daughter] Harper, and it was the most amazing thing.” “It was one of my favourite evenings. I can’t remember what it was, but I know she’s not eaten it since!.” David also revealed that he inherited his culinary skills from his mum and grandmother, adding that through childhood, he looked forward to family get-togethers on Saturdays, where chicken noodle soup with Matzo ball dumplings, jellied eels and pie mash would be served. “You know, I was in the kitchen the other day, cooking for the kids, and Victoria was like, ‘Can I help? What can I do?’ and I was like, ‘Sit down, have a vodka and tonic, relax and be with the kids,’ ” he recalled. “This is what I love to do.” The couple tied the knot on the 4th of July at Luttrellstown Castle near Dublin and have four children together.
