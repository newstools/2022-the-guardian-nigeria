Amid frantic efforts to resolve the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State, the Senator Ibrahim Shekarau-led faction of the party has vowed to accept “only fair proposal” from the national headquarters of the party. A statement signed by the leader of G-7, Shekarau, who represents Kano Central in the Senate, maintained that there was no final decision on the ongoing reconciliation process. “As we await the proposals of the national leadership, we assure our teeming supporters that we shall closely study such proposals and accept only what is just and equitable to ensure inclusiveness in our party and strengthen cohesion,” it reads. The G-7 noted that its position was hinged on the fact that it is the beneficiary of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court ruling, which validated the congresses it held, against the Ganduje anointed leadership of the group.
Efforts to reach the Ganduje faction to react on the issue were not successful.
