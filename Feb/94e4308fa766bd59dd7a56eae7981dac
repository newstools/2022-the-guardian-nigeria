A social development programme involving all participant teams has kicked off the activities at the Africa Schools Champions Cup in Kinshasa, with FIFA (www.FIFA.com) Secretary General Fatma Samoura lending her encouragement during a visit to the sessions.  In collaboration with streetfootballworld, TackleAfrica and the United Nations Agency UNWomen, teambuilding sessions were activated for both male and female players from the six participating member associations to have fun together and build trust, whilst reinforcing the importance of equal opportunity.
