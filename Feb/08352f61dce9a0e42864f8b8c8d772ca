An Abia State businessman, Onyekachi Onyekwere, has declared that the state is in dire need of a new breed of politicians that will ensure better governance. He urged the All Progressives Congress (APC) to consider presenting credible aspirants that would allow new politicians to build the state.  “The state needs a new breed of politicians like Daniel Eke, who knows his onions and has experienced it all. He is ready to give all back to society. He is ready to fight crimes in the state with modern technology,” he stated.
