The commencement of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry(DE) Registration exercise earlier scheduled for Saturday, 12th February 2022, has now been postponed to Saturday, 19th February 2022 and to end on Saturday, 26th March 2022. The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) said the one-week postponement is to allow for more fine-tuning of the upgraded and more user-friendly procedures for candidates’ registration. JAMB spokesman Fabian Benjamin who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, said the process, which will be concluded within the one-week extension period, is also aimed at accommodating feedback from candidates and other stakeholders alike. “The Board wishes the general public to note that the Board is ever-ready to provide world-class services to Nigerians,” Benjamin said. “Further to the above, the new and improved procedures for the 2022 UTME Registration would be made available on the Board’s website, its weekly bulletin as well as other media outlets on Monday, 14th February 2022.” According to him, “candidates, are by this notice, urged to follow keenly the procedures for registration as would be announced by the Board.”
