To select Nigeria’s contingent for the 2022 World School Athletics Championships held in Turkey later this year, the Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF) is organising a two-day trial at the Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH) in Lagos from today. According to NSSF, the trials will involve students born in the years 2004, 2005, and 2006 across the country jostling for places in the country’s contingent for the world championship. Already, some states have organised trials to pick their teams for the competition. The states will compete in 14 events ranging from 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 3000m, long and high jumps, shot put and discus, among others. NSSF President, Olabisi Joseph, said the trials are aimed at selecting the best legs among students for the country. “Nigeria, having missed participating in the International School Sport Federation (ISF) organised competition for some years, is back to make a positive statement with our performances, while also giving our school boys and girls the opportunity to compete with their counterparts on the world stage,” she said. “Nigeria, as an active member of the world body, has been invited to present a team for the championships and it behoves on us to give all the students equal opportunity to make the team,” “the NSSF boss said. She revealed that NSSF has advised the states to assemble their teams through states’ tournaments, which most of them have done and we believe this would afford us the chance to identify new talents as well as select the best legs for the country. “It is an open tournament for both public and private schools and we want to ensure that all the students utilise the event to also showcase their talents,” she added. She said the NSSF and the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) would work together to ensure the technical aspect of the trial is of international standard, while the National Association of Athletics Technical Officials (NAATO) will oversee the officiating.
