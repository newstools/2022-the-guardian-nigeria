Former President of the Senate, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki has condemned the abrupt impeachment of the Zamfara State Deputy Governor, Mahdi Ali Gusau, without complying with constitutional process and procedures. “After 21-years of our democracy, when all leaders and stakeholders should be pursuing and encouraging all means to follow the Constitution, the abrupt impeachment of the Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Mahdi Ali, without following due process and just because he refused to join the ruling party is truly disheartening,” Saraki said. “We cannot attempt to subvert the freedom of association of any individual — whether a sitting public office holder or a regular citizen. This freedom allows any individual to freely join or exit a political party when he deems fit. “The ruling party should not and cannot attempt to brow-beat a public office holder to join their party or to bend to their political leanings, simply because they have the majority in the legislature. “We must preserve the integrity of our democratic institutions, otherwise, we risk setting dangerous constitutional and political precedents that can spiral. “All leaders, in both the ruling APC, and my party, the PDP, must come out to condemn this impeachment as an embarrassment to our democracy. We must all stand with Barr. Mahdi Ali, for his courage and tenacity in the face of overwhelming adversity. “This young leader has shown that he is a person with true conviction. He stands as a beacon of hope for many young Nigerians,” Saraki stated.
