• Seeks dialogue to address challenges
Federal Government, yesterday, said it remained committed to honouring promises made to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to prevent disruptive strikes, engender uninterrupted academic programmes and improve funding of education institutions. The Federal Government said no society will neglect its educational system including all its component parts. President Muhammadu Buhari made the pledge in Abuja, while receiving members of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC), led by the Co-Chairs, the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, and the President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo Ayokunle, at the State House. Commending the leadership of NIREC for intervening in the yearlong strike by ASUU and holding consultations with the parties, the President said no society that wishes itself well neglects its educational system. Buhari urged NIREC to, in subsequent consultations with members of ASUU, share with them that government regards them and the service they provide to the nation very highly. He said: “However, they should be cognisant of the fiscal pressures that we are currently facing. Nevertheless, we remain committed to honouring our promises. ‘’For their part, I would like to encourage ASUU to continue to work with us towards finding resolutions to the challenges that confront us. ‘’My administration is committed to this engagement and dialogue, and I urge them to stay the course towards a joint resolution in the best interest of our children and nation.”
