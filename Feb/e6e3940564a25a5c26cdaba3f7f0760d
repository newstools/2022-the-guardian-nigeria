The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it has arrested an informant for bandits in Tureta Local Government Area (LGA) of Sokoto State. The NSCDC Commandant in the state, Mr Muhammad Dada said this while addressing newsmen on Monday in Sokoto. Dada accused informants of sustaining banditry in the state and if not for informants, banditry would have been history in the state. “Informants monitor the movement of security personnel and alert bandits whenever an operation is due to take place. “I appeal to the general public to assist the security agencies with any information that will aid in fishing out informants in the communities. “Any information is vital to us no matter how small it is. Such information can be analysed by security agents in order to get something that will assist in addressing banditry,’’ Dada said. Besides, the commandant said the corps had successfully dismantled bandit camps in Rekoni, Akale and Bagaye forest in Tureta LGA. He said that operative of the corps also recovered 14 cows, 52 sheep and three donkeys. The commandant said that a member of a local security outfit – “Yan-Sakai’’, banned from operating in the state, had been arrested. He said the suspect was arrested in connection with the killing of one Riskuwa Kalamon, father of nine children. “The suspect has admitted to have taking part in the crime and would be charge to court soon,’’ Dada said.
