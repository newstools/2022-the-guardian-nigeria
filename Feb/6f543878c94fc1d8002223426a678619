A former Head of State, Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd), is billed to chair the public presentation of a book authored by Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi. The public presentation of the book, titled: “Unfinished Greatness: Envisioning a New Nigeria,” will hold on Thursday, February 24, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. at the NAF Conference Centre, Kado, Abuja. According to Managing Director of RedGecko Limited, Mr. Cornelius Onuoha, organisers of the event, the presentation will feature a keynote address by Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, distinguished professor, Wits School of Governance and Immediate Past Director for Africa and West Asia, International IDEA. Dr. Joe Abah, the Nigeria Country Director, DAI Global, will be the book reviewer, with a stellar inter-generational line-up of panellists, including Waziri Adio, Editorial Board Member, ThisDay Newspapers; Yemi Adamolekun, Executive Director, Enough-is-Enough Nigeria; Ndi Kato, Executive Director, Dinidari Africa; and Hamzat Bala Lawal, Founder and Executive Director, Connected Development. “The Foreword was written by a former Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd), and in it, he said: ‘The title Unfinished Greatness inspires hope in us that our march into the future is a purposeful journey of destiny.” In the words of Dr. John Dramani Mahama, former President of Ghana, “Nigeria remains central to the vision of an African renaissance. In Unfinished Greatness, Fayemi reminds us of the power of unity in nation-building. The ideas in this book encapsulate the roadmap for peace and sustainable development in Nigeria, and indeed the rest of Africa.” The statement also quoted a former Minister of Education, Prof Tunde Adeniran, as stating that “Unfinished Greatness convincingly challenges false narratives about our trajectory as a country and offers profound historical insights to prove that there is more that unites us than our differences.”
