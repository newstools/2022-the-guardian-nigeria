Bureaucratic stonewalling in public service has perhaps reached its feverish pitch at the least expected places – the tertiary education sector. And in case anyone is still looking for reasons for the near-collapse of tertiary education in Nigeria or why it is a basket case draining off its best hands daily, there it is at Prof. Olufemi Peters-led National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN).
 
For clarity, Prof. Peters has a sterling track record in academics and administration to justify his appointment as the Vice Chancellor of NOUN. Technically, he is a square peg in a square hole. However, to him belongs a personal standard that his institution has rarely lived up to. And that contradiction warrants this piece.
 
When President Olusegun Obasanjo, as he then was, reopened the Open University in 2001 after 17 years of closure, he had in mind an open distance learning institution to cater for the largest number of students in a single university in Nigeria. The adult-like ‘do-it-yourself’ setting has less stringent entry requirements, and tailor-made to fill the knowledge-gap and certification of people in all walks of life without the barrier of space and time.
