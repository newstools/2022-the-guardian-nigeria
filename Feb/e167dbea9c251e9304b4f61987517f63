French commercial plane manufacturer, Airbus, has disclosed plans to recruit 6,000 new employees during the first half of 2022. The hiring drive will take place worldwide, with an emphasis on acquiring new skill sets to support the company’s decarbonisation efforts, digital transformation, and cyber technology. A significant portion of the positions will also be earmarked for recent graduates. Most of the year 2020 and a large part of 2021 was a terribly uncertain time for those employed in the aviation industry. Airlines, airports, and OEMs alike were forced to let go of large numbers of employees as they battled an unprecedented crisis. And while we have not seen the last of the pandemic and related travel restrictions, some actors are beginning to look to the future with renewed trust and optimism. As the aerospace industry at large is beginning to show significant signs of recovery, European planemaker Airbus announced on Wednesday it is looking to hire new talent to “prepare for the future of aviation”. Airbus Chief Human Resources and Workplace Officer, Thierry Baril, said Airbus had demonstrated resilience throughout the COVID crisis and has laid the foundations for a bold future for sustainable aviation.
