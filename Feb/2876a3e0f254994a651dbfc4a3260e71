The Federal Government has acquired soil testing laboratory and geographic information system aimed at boosting food security, suitability and capability of land for the sustainable production of different crops and land use. With this, there are four national soil laboratories located in Abuja, Kaduna, Ibadan and Umudike, and each equipment has the capacity to analyse large quantities of soil samples, which will go a long way in expanding soil testing capacity. At the commissioning in Abuja, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Mohammad Abubakar, said the Federal Government was committed to agriculture to lead the diversification of the nation’s economy.  Earlier, Director of Agricultural Land and Climate Change Services Department in the Ministry, Shehu Bello, said the laboratories in Abuja would service the needs of the adjoining states in the North Central, while others would be used in the southwest, southeast and northwest regions.
