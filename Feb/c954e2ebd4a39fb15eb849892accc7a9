The book titled I Am Because We Are: An African Mother’s Fight for the Soul of a Nation is in memory of her mothers legacy that encouraged millions of people even when faced with corruption and misogyny. Released in January 2022, the book was made available in Nigerian book stores on the 4th of February. The book tells the story of Dora Akunyili’s life from her daughter’s perspective, narrating how her mother’s story moulded her into the type of woman she is. Stirred by the African beliefs of Ubuntu – the significance of community over one person the book gives in detail Dora Akunyili’s war against deceitful drug manufacturers whose products endangered the lives of many Nigerians. It revisits how Dora, a woman in a male dominate sphere rose to become a cabinet minister and was faced with death threats, political plotting, and an assassination attempt for defending the voiceless. I Am Because We Are: An African Mother’s Fight for the Soul of a Nation explores the completeness behind a woman now regarded as the Amazon. Recounting the book, the author said: “While the world saw Dora Akunyili at the peak of her strength a warrior with a gap-toothed smile whose light-skinned oval face was crowned with a colourful head-tie that doubled as armour against incessant attacks against her values and also her life – I saw the complexity that was hidden from sight. This is the story of her multiplicity: the story of my mother. “I have spent much of the last four years dedicated to bringing her story to life in this memoir – each step in researching and writing her story has allowed an unwrapping of her – the girl, the daughter, the dreamer, the wife, mother, warrior – her motivations, her struggles and celebrations. The result is this book I have spent much of the last four years dedicated to bringing her story to life in this memoir. This is the coming together of her parts. I am happy to share this story that it might inspire the whole. I believe stories matter, our stories matter, and this is one of such stories.’’
