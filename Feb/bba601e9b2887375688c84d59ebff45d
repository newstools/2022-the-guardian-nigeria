A viral video released on Thursday morning showed officers of the NDLEA arresting the artists at their home in Lekki. While an eyewitness claimed that the arrests were made without a warrant, the agency revealed that they had arrested them following a tip of drugs possession. Speaking to Daily Trust, Femi Babafemi, the Director of Media and Advocacy, said, “Yes, they have been arrested because we had reliable information that they were in possession of drugs. We moved in on them and recovered drugs. That is why five of them were arrested; three males and two females.” “When their house was searched, we found in their possession molly and cannabis. The investigation is still ongoing, but we have to trace where they are getting these substances from.” While the singers remain in custody, their record label Marian Records, run by Naira Marley, has yet to publicly comment on the arrest. However, Naira Marley took to Instagram to express his aggravation shortly after the arrest. He wrote, “I’m so angry right now.”
