The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has commissioned 73 brand new HILUX utility vehicles, saloon cars and staff buses to enhance operational efficiency in its efforts to rid the nation of falsified and counterfeit medicines, unwholesome food, cosmetics and products.
   
Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, who commissioned the vehicles at the weekend, said the vehicles would put an end to the hitherto practice, whereby clients would bring their vehicles to ferry agency staff to the site for inspection.  The DG further explained that the officials of the investigation and enforcement directorate would make use of the utility vehicles to pursue peddlers of contraband, counterfeited products across the nooks and crannies of the country.
