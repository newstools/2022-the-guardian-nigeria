Taking to social media, the rapper shared a screenshot of a blog post about Eilish handing an inhaler to a distressed fan while performing at the State Arena Farm in Atalanta. The blog post claimed that the Lovely singer had ‘dissed’ Scot despite videos from the show revealing that she never mentioned Scott or Astroworld. In the now-viral clip, Eilish said, “We’re taking care of our people.” “I wait for people to be OK until I keep going.” However, Kanye demanding that she apologises, wrote, “Come on Billie, we love you. Please apologise to Trav and to the families of the people who lost their lives. No one intended this to happen.” “Trav didn’t have any idea of what was happening when he was on stage and was very hurt by what happened, and yes, Trav will be with me at Coachella, but now I need Billie to apologise before I perform.” Commenting on the post, Eilish wrote, “Literally never said a thing about Travis. Was just helping a fan.” Kanye West and Billie Eilish are scheduled to headline Coachella 2022 alongside Swedish House Mafia and Harry Styles. Travis Scott had been dropped out from the festival following the deadly tragedy at his Astroworld Festival in Houston, leaving 10 people dead and hundreds injured. However, Kanye’s direct attack at Eilish comes as a surprise as she’s not the first artiste to stop her show to help a fan. In fact, back in November, just weeks after the Astroworld tragedy, singer SZA had stopped her show when a fan passed out in the audience and handed out bottles of water to the crowd.
