The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) has reiterated the need for a closer tie with startups in the country.
   
NITDA said collaboration with startups in the country has become crucial to, among others, deepen indigenous information and communications technology (ICT) contents, adding that promotion of local content agenda of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has remained one its focal points. 
   
The promotion of indigenous content which is one of the strategic pillars of the NITDA’s Strategic Road Map and Action Plan 2021-2024 was designed specifically to create opportunities for the development of homegrown solutions to meet the country’s needs as well as create wealth for the nation.  Inuwa described the tech ecosystems as a ‘home’, and stated that he understood the frustrations and challenges of local startups in the country because that was where he started from. “I started very early when I was in 200 level. I perfectly understand how rough the journey is. I know how important it is to have enabling policies and infrastructure and how painful it is to fail”, he averred.
   
He, however, disclosed that currently, he has taken it upon himself to utilize all resources and opportunities at his disposal to make the tech ecosystem a more viable and better one.
