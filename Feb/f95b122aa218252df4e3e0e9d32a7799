Rector, Ronik Polytechnic, Ejigbo, Lagos, Mrs. Julianah Atoye, has stressed the importance of education, insisting that a country with educated citizens would always have people with logical thinking and views. Speaking at the second convocation of the institution, Atoye noted that education provides knowledge, develops logical attitude, enhances capacity of an individual and helps in choosing the right government in a democratic dispensation. She added that education also helps in the physical, social, mental and spiritual development of an individual. “It also enhances social and moral values of a person and makes him or her more sensible, tolerant, hopeful and empathic. It modifies and enhances the behaviour of a person through rigorous learning and development.” She stated. The guest speaker, Prof of Accounting and Strategic Financial Management, Rufus Ishola Akintoye, urged the graduating students to pursue their vision with excellence and good character. Speaking on the topic, “The power of vision and character in the journey of excellence,” Akintoye said contrary to beliefs, Nigeria is a country of limitless opportunities, but only people of great character and vision could maximise the benefits. Visitor to the institution, Mr. Chris Alabi, urged the graduating students to work hard, achieve their goals and fulfil their destinies. He said hard work would always assist in achieving great feats. According to him, “life is not a bed of roses, it has problems and struggles but it has appealing aspects, which gives one hope and positivity. We should make life advantageous and progressively excellent.” Chairman, Governing Council, Reuben Odunsi, who spoke on “Self-employment and wealth creation,” said self-reliant people are assets to the nation because they are able to create sustainable wealth. He advised the graduating students to build their psyche by believing in themselves and imbibe “I can do spirit.”
