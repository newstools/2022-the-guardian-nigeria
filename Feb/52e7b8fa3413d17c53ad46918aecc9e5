An expert in the manufacturing industry has called for increased local production that supports job creation and ultimately stimulates growth and diversification of the Nigerian economy for self-reliance and export of non-oil and gas products. Managing Director, Zenith Exhibitions, Joseph Oru, in a statement, stressed  the need to attract foreign direct investment, which would support the Nigerian industrialisation plan. He noted that stakeholders in the manufacturing industry would be provided an opportunity to upscale their production and teams and also get adequate information on access to finance at the Equipment and Manufacturing West Africa Expo (EMWA) 2022. The third edition, which will be held from April 26th to 28th, with the theme, ‘Rethinking Manufacturing and Value Chains for Inclusion and Sustainability,’ will drive stakeholders’ conversations, especially in a time the Omicron variant is worsening the global supply chain crisis. “The third edition of EMWA will continue to create and enhance new and current partnership opportunities that will help companies to improve business excellence and productivity. EMWA remains a highly recommended platform for businesses to establish new partnerships, networking and contracting opportunities,” Oru said. Supported by more than 100 international and regional exhibiting brands from over 10 countries, Exhibition pavilions will be showcased from around the world with expected attendance from Indonesia, Brazil, Italy, Germany, Turkey, India, and Egypt. Oru explained that international manufacturing equipment suppliers will be demonstrating the latest manufacturing machinery, tools and spare parts including air compressors, processors, mixers, conveyor systems, automation systems, handling systems, press forming machines, labelling machines, dust extractors, wire cutting tools, turbo chargers, drilling and cutting machines/tools, surface treatment machinery, grinding machines, laser cutting technology, generators, climate control systems and much more. He added that like the previous year, this year’s edition of EMWA will be supported by the Kano State Government, Lagos State Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning, Raw Material Research and Development Council,  (RMRDC), Kano Chambers of Commerce industry mines and agriculture, (KACCIMA), Federal Ministry of Power, Ministry of Trade and Investment, and more.
