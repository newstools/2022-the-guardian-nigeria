The graduate of the University of Port Harcourt, won an all-expense-paid trip sponsored my Vantage Migration to Zanzibar, Tanzania where she spent her Christmas. This travel contest is Vantage Migration’s social entrepreneurship, which is aimed towards giving anyone a flight experience and international exposure. In an interview, she said “I learned how to say mambo which means hello, Asante asana that’s thank you very much, how to do like my speed in learning Swahili. The Tanzanian people are good with recycling waste like used bottles, the used paper in packaging thing in the market is practised and they use the right-hand driving method.” Reliving the moment, “From my home country Nigeria we passed through Lome, from Lome to Adidas Ababa in Ethiopia and then Tanzania it was a worthwhile experience. We stayed at the Madinat AL Bahr Business & Spa Hotel, the service there is awesome. We visited the Prison Island formerly built for rebellious prisoners but didn’t achieve its purpose, it was used as a station for the quarantine of yellow fever crisis, the island is used for tourism at the moment. We went for safari blue and snorkelling, we visited beaches and spice Market.” While appreciating Dr. Linda and her team, she said in smattering Swahili how grateful she feels for the opportunity bestowed on her by Dr. Linda. “Asante’s asana, Dr Linda Iheme, and Vantage Migration for this golden opportunity I’m ever grateful for.” Vantage Migration and Allied Consult is a body that has the interest and the wellbeing of young ones at heart.
