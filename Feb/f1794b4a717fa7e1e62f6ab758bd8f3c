Sen. Ibrahim Shekarau (APC-Kano Central) on Sunday in Sokoto said political parties in Nigeria are one and the same. Shekarau, a former governor of Kano State, made the assertion at the inauguration of the empowerment project of Rep. Balarabe Salame (APC- Gwadabawa/Illela). “In all the political parties in the country, there are good people who have good intentions for the masses. “Likewise, the same political parties have bad people whose selfish interests are always their priorities. “Therefore, we should always be careful to ensure that the leaders we are electing are those with clean intentions toward our collective development. “Moreover, we need to always keep in mind that God will judge us on our decision of choice of politicians to whom we give our mandate,’’ he said. Shekarau appreciated the Sokoto State political architecture and recommended it to other parts of the country. “A PDP governor attending a function organised by an APC lawmaker and not only that, the two political parties’ chairmen and supporters are in attendance; this is highly commendable,’’ he noted. Shekarau commended Rep. Salame for his sustained efforts at supporting his constituents while appealing to the beneficiaries to ensure the judicious use of the assistance. In his remarks, Secretary to Sokoto State Government, Alhaji Saidu Umar, who represented Gov. Aminu Tambuwal, thanked the lawmaker for extending his invitation to the state government in spite of political party differences. He urged politicians in the state to emulate Salame in that direction. Earlier, Salame listed items distributed as 329 sewing machines, 167 motorcycles and 50 tricycles. The lawmaker also fulfilled his pledge of N2 million for the development of Sokoto East Senatorial District. “The empowerment project is part of my commitment to support the good intentions of President Muhammadu Buhari at easing the hardship of Nigerians,’’ Salame said.
