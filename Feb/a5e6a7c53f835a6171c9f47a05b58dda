After leading the Terranga Lions to their second consecutive final at the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun on Wednesday, influential striker, Sadio Mane, pointed his hands to the sky in appreciation to God.
 
The Liverpool strongman was all smiles as he approached the mixed zone at the Ahmadou Ahidjo Stadium in Yaoundé. “I am happy and grateful to God for seeing us this far and I believe it will be mission possible for us this time.” In 2019, when Egypt hosted the 32nd edition of the tournament, Mane and ‘the gang’ brushed aside top oppositions on their way to the final only to lose the trophy to Algeria at Cairo Stadium.  “This is a big tournament and we have to work for one another,” Mane said. “Our dream is to win the trophy for ourselves, family members, friends and more importantly, the people of Senegal.” He continued: “We are going to the hotel to celebrate this moment. We still have a few days to plan for the final, but all I can tell you now is that we will put everything into the final on Sunday.”
