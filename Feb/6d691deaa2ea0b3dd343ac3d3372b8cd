• Nigeria loses 32-26 to hosts, Guinea at CAN Handball Junior Edo Dynamos and COAS Shooters are former premier league sides now competing to return to the top-flight league. They are among the teams fighting for qualification to the premier league at the National Division One Handball League in Benin, Edo State, from Friday to March 6. A statement by the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), yesterday, listed Edo Dynamos, Benue Buffaloes, Correctional Boys, Kwara Adorable Stars, Cross River, Bayelsa United, Rivers, Mindscope HB Academy, Borno Spiders and Delta State as team to compete in the men’s category, while COAS Shooters, Benue Queens, Sokoto Rima, Police Machine and Suleja Shooters will battle in the women class. Meanwhile, the Nigerian women U-20 handball team at the weekend lost 26 to 32 to hosts, Guinea, in their second game in Group B of the ongoing biennial 28th Africa Women Handball Junior Championship holding in Conakry. The Nigerian team had earlier lost 40 to 42 to Tunisia in their opening game. They missed chances and eventually lost ground against the Guineans right from the first half, which ended 17 to 12. The second half was just like the first with Nigeria losing key chances through avoidable turnovers. Nigeria will meet Algeria in their next match with the hope that by defeating the North Africans, they stand a chance of qualifying for the next round as one of the best losers.
