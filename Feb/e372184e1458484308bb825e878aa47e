The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday said its national convention slated for February 26, 2022, will not hold on the date. The APC instead disclosed that it has scheduled its zonal congresses to hold on March 26. APC announced its decision in a letter of the party to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). “This notice supersedes our earlier notice for National Convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14 this is predicated on the evaluation of our Party Constitution,” APC said in the letter signed by the party’s National Secretary Sen. John Akpanudoedehe and Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni. The party’s National Convention had been a subject of debate for weeks as usual pre-convention activities failed to hold.
