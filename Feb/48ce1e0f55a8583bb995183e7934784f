The Nigeria Navy will continue to provide adequate security to critical national assets in the Niger Delta to ensure increased economic development of the area, the outgoing Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Eastern Naval Command, Rear Admiral SK Ibrahim, stated this at the commissioning of the Navy Mini-Barracks in Rivers State. The barracks was built and donated to the Nigerian Navy by Green Energy International Limited, the Operator of the Otakikpo marginal field in collaboration with its technical partner, Lekoil Oil and Gas limited. Ibrahim, who was represented by the Commander Nigerian Navy Ship Jubilee, Commodore Olubode Fazaz, stated that corporate entities, the entire society and security agencies must continue to work together to protect investments and secure lives and property in the Niger Delta. He said the Nigeria Navy under the Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, has improved the security of the area. He commended Green Energy for its consistent contribution to the security of the Andoni area and recalled its construction of the Navy barracks in Ikuru town. He said the mini barracks would provide more accommodation and facilities to the naval staff to boost their capacity. CEO of Green Energy, Prof. Anthony Adegbulugbe, said the project was part of the company’s corporate social responsibility (CSR). He said the project was a follow-up to the building of the Navy facility and barracks in Ikuru town in 2015, and the donation of Hilux truck in 2019, adding that the security network of the area would improve with the new accommodation facility.
