Their high fiber content also helps detoxify the body of toxins and waste matter that might harm the body. An increased consumption of these superfoods means an increased fiber consumption thus eliminating excessive estrogen and helping with weight control. Another superfood with fibroid healing properties, Flaxseed contains phytoestrogens which are helpful in replacing the damaged estrogen in the body. This helps prevent a state of estrogen dominance which allows for the growth of fibroid. A rich source of soluble fiber, legumes detoxify the body removing waste, toxins and excess estrogen.

Another food that improves gynecological health, garlic and onions contain antioxidants that prevent free radical damage to health cells in the body including the pelvic region. Damage from free radicals also increase the risk of developing fibroids. Cold-water fishes like salmon, sardines, tuna, mackerel also improve fibroid healing.
