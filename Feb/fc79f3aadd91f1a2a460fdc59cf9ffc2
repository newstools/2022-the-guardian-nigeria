Bob Marley’s daughter Cedella, who helped in the planning of the exhibition, said she was pleased with the interactivity, mainly in the room committed to Marley’s sports interests. “Really beautiful pictures of daddy playing football,” she said. “It’s very sensory. That was the aim and I think we have done it.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1658900 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cedella-Marley-and-Saiyan-Marley.-Photo-Ian-West-PA.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="768" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cedella-Marley-and-Saiyan-Marley.-Photo-Ian-West-PA.jpg 620w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cedella-Marley-and-Saiyan-Marley.-Photo-Ian-West-PA-320x192.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cedella-Marley-and-Saiyan-Marley.-Photo-Ian-West-PA-600x360.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Cedella during her trip to London used the opportunity to go to the home her father once lived in that is nearby Oakley Street in Chelsea, where he stayed while recording music during the 1970s. “I have never been there before, so it was my first time,” she said. “Daddy used to live in that place … And I can see why because the park is just across the street, so he could play football and just go back to jamming.” The “One Love Experience” titled exhibition, tells the life story of the late Jamaican reggae singer.
“The hope is to take the feeling of Bob Marley and the spirit of One Love,” said curator Jonathan Shank. Bob Marley’s 18-year-old grandson Saiyan said London must have been special to Marley as he chose there to get away after an assassination attempt. “I feel like every year I just learn something new about him,” Saiyan told Reuters. “I just want to carry his legacy, and hold it down for gramps, you know.” The exhibition at London’s Saatchi Gallery will run for the next 10 weeks before taking the route on a multi-city tour, features memorabilia, photographs and personal belongings. These vary from the creative handwritten lyrics of “Turn Your Lights Down Low” to shoes worn by Marley in the 1970s. Bob Marley was born in 1945 in the rural Jamaican urban area of Nine Mile. Marley became a worldwide famous person with hits songs such as “No Woman, No Cry” and “One Love”. He died of melanoma cancer in 1981 aged 36.
