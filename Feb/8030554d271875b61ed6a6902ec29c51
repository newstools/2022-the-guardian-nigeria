Barely three weeks after the inauguration of its new executive committee, Ibori Golf and Country Club, Asaba, has laid the foundation of its new starter hut. The ceremony, performed by the new Larry Osai-led executive committee, which also includes Tom Nwakalo-Imu (Vice Captain); Tam Brisibe (Treasurer); Austine Modumgwo (Course Officer); Queen Mowah (Lady Captain) and Vivian Ebreneyin. Speaking at the event, Osai commended the immediate past executive committee for the level of development they achieved, adding that his administration would leverage on the developments and attain new heights. “This is part of our administration’s desire to justify the confidence reposed in us by members of the club. More capital projects are in the pipeline for execution before our tenure ends. “I am appealing and seeking support from all club members to move and develop the club together with a view to making it a prime golfing destination in Nigeria. One tree cannot make a forest,” he said.
