Ahead of the February 12, 2022 Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Council Poll, Youth Initiative for Advocacy, Growth & Advancement (YIAGA) Africa has urged citizens to reward, with their votes, candidates who can account for resources allocated to the council. YIAGA Programme Director, Cynthia Mbamalu, stated this in Abuja during a community outreach, yesterday, to mobilise residents to participate in the area council elections slated for this weekend. Mbamalu advised women to reward candidates capable of ending multiple taxation in their markets. She said: “There are resources that are allocated to local councils that are unaccounted for, and we elect executives every electoral cycle. If they are not accountable to the people, who will they be accountable to? “Government is supposed to look into market issue to end multiple taxation for average citizens in the country. This the local councils’ responsibility. If you don’t come out to vote, you won’t have leaders who care about you.” Earlier, YIAGA Executive Director, Samson Itodo, who said the event was part of the groups 15th anniversary, stressed the need to mobilise and enlighten market women on the procedure to vote as well as collection of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs).
