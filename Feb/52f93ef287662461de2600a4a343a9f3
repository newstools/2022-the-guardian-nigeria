Of the many cardinal programmes embedded in the Buhari Presidential campaign, I cannot decipher a single promise fulfilled by President Buhari since 2015. With an array of lawyers in his cabinet, a senior advocate of Nigeria as his vice president, another as his attorney general;  and yet another as his minister of works. None of them including other distinguished professionals could persuade him to stand by his promises and at least fulfil the most pressing one, that of insurgency, the widespread kidnapping, banditry and ethnic cleansing in Kaduna, Niger, Zamfara and Benue states.
