As part of efforts to support the Federal Government’s attempt to curtail the spread of COVID-19, ENL Consortium has facilitated the vaccination of over 600 dockworkers at its terminal in Apapa Port. ENL Consortium is the operator of Terminals C and D at the Lagos Port Complex Apapa. Authorised health officials conducted the dockworkers’ vaccination exercise, which was carried out from January 27 to February 2, 2021. Speaking on the exercise, the Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of ENL Consortium, Princess Vicky Haastrup, said according to the Federal and state governments as well as the World Health Organisation (WHO) COVID-19 vaccines are effective and can lower the risk of getting and spreading the virus. She said while vaccines help prevent serious illness and death in children and adults even if they get infected by COVID-19, it is also necessary port workers, including dockworkers, get vaccinated as they are essential workers. “The ports must keep operating round the clock to keep the economy moving and to ensure the continuous supply of essential commodities to Nigerians. Dockworkers are important to ensuring continuity at the port and we care for their wellbeing. “These are the reasons why we deemed it necessary to invite health officials into the port and encourage dockworkers to get vaccinated in support of the effort by the government to put an end to this pandemic,” she said. The dockworkers expressed gratitude to the management of ENL Consortium for facilitating the vaccination exercise. A representative of the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUN), Kunle Bamimodu commended the leadership of the terminal for bringing the initiative to the workplace, noting that it is not that convenient for workers to move around because of the nature of their work.
