SIR: Nowadays, many parents don’t care about the activities of their wards, thus exposing them to bad influences in the society. The home is the purveyor of both the good and the bad people, so moral upbringing of children is important to a peaceful society. In particular, the family is the first agent of socialisation where parents teach and impact good conduct to their children; but reverse is the case in today’s societies because parents and the elderly people of the society, largely, don’t care anymore about the activities of the wards and this brings a lot of destruction to our society. Why are our parents and society in general abdicating their responsibility and thus failing to understand that those engaging in illegal, criminal, felonious and unlawful actions also come from home and families? Why can’t they realise that a good society is dependent on the good conduct or training that the family can bequeath to their children? Issues of criminality such as banditry, kidnapping and other felonious issues bedevilling this country today certainly took their roots from the home when good parental care was missing. Any family that fails or refuses to train its children properly is only aiding grief in the society and endangering the lives of thousands of innocent, law-abiding members of the community. Parents should play the vital role they are required to play in raising good children, so that they will become good Ambassadors in our society. It is sad that today’s generation of parents have failed the society, unlike in the past when parents were very strict and took it upon themselves to give decent training and discipline to their wards. But it is not too late for parents to change and give our children good examples, so that we will be proud of the children in the future.
