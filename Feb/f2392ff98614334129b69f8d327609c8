Sir: Every now and then, a smear campaign against the NDDC, possibly sponsored by self-serving politicians and contractors, would make its way through a section of the media. The kernel of these publications is usually threefold: attack the forensic audit which President Muhammadu Buhari ordered into the affairs of the commission and ask the President to immediately recompose the commission’s board.
 
Senator Godswill Akpabio, the supervising minister of NDDC, is often the target of most of the attacks. He is seen as the one stopping Buhari from forming a new board for the agency. In the editorial opinion of THISDAY newspaper of Wednesday, February 23, 2022, titled: “NDDC and the anti-graft hoax,” the same argument is made. It is difficult to conjecture that a minister would have the power to stop the President from carrying out his duties. I do not know why so many powers and invincibility is ascribed to Akpabio. Even when he was our governor in Akwa Ibom, many people had thought that he had the ability to put out the sun! In addition, the editorial comments asked that “full details of the findings by the forensic audit should be made public quickly,” adding that “the Presidency, which ordered the audit, needs to act on the findings by referring cases of indictment to the EFCC or the judiciary.” I agree and I believe the Federal Government is working on these. Just last week, a dubious allegation came from the leadership of Ijaw Youth Congress (IYC). It stated that the management of the commission had made payments of N20 billion to ghost contractors. It is notable that the commission had promptly countered such spurious claims with facts and figures.
