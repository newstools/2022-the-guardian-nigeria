The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has reiterated that it mandate is to reduce road accident by 15 per cent. The new Sector Commander in Cross River State, Mrs. Elizabeth Akinlade, stated this during a courtesy call to the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Calabar. Akinlade, who is the first female commander deployed to the state, said her visit was to seek cooperation between her organisation and journalists in the state for the corps to succeed in its quest. “I am here among you to solicit your cooperation in sensitising the public on why we are carrying out enforcement on our roads. Many people do not know that we are helping Nigerians to stay alive because many of those who have died in accidents are in their prime and are supposed to be useful to the country. It is unfortunate that here in Nigeria, we have to force people to stay alive.  One of our strategic goals is to ensure that we reduce accidents on our roads by 15 per cent,” she said. She disclosed that her organisation has mapped out a strategy to monitor motorists in the state and promised that she will work hard to meet the overall goal of the Corps while in the state. Welcoming the FRSC commander, the NUJ chairman, Victor Udu, assured her and her team of a good partnership in all areas.
