In May 2021, the supermodel aged 50 announced the birth of her daughter. Speaking to Vogue, Campbell speaks fondly of her daughter; she says, “I’m lucky my little one loves to travel like me – no whimpering taking off or landing.” “She’s a good girl: she sleeps very well, she hardly ever cries, and I’m told she’s very alert for her age. She’s just started waving, which is fun. She laughs a lot. She’s almost talking.” She continues, “I think she might walk before she crawls. And she’s got six teeth already.” Revealing that her child was not adopted contrary to speculations, Campbell still refuses to give details of her child’s birth. She said, “She wasn’t adopted – she’s my child.” “I can count on one hand the number of people who knew that I was having her,” she admits. “But she is the biggest blessing I could ever imagine. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.” Naomi lets us in on a little secret about modelling; she finds it nerve-racking now that she’s older. “I still enjoy it, but it’s nerve-racking!” the mother-of-one explained. “Because I’m 51 years old walking with girls who are 18! It’s great to be with these young ‘uns at my age, but I have to say, at one of the shows, I was like, ‘Come on, girls! Pick up your feet! Why are you walking so slow?'” She added: “I definitely feel like my time was more joyful. We smiled! We got to show off our personalities.” Back in July, the new mum of one was first spotted with her daughter in public sporting an oversized white shirt with loose-fitting black bottoms with a thick green stripe extending the length of the leg as she walked through the streets in style while pushing her daughter’s pram.
