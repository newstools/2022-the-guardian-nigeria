African football governing body, CAF, has approved Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, as venue for Nigeria’s Qatar 2022 World Cup final qualifier against Ghana billed for next month. CAF gave the approval via a message sent to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) this week. Sports Minister, Sunday Dare, who disclosed the development, yesterday, in Abuja through his Special Assistant, Toyin Ibitoye, also revealed that both Super Falcons’ Africa Women Cup of Nations qualifier and Falconets World Cup qualifier, will hold on the same venue, which was recently renovated under a public-private sector partnership initiative. He said the approval was sequel to the stadium assessment and inspection process conducted by CAF, adding, however, that there are inspection comments and remarks to be addressed in the coming period by the NFF to guarantee that the stadium remains in the list of CAF approved venues for senior competitions. Ibitoye said the message dated February 3, 2022 and signed by CAF’s Development Director in the letter, Raul Chipenda, also directs Nigeria to “ensure that the playing surface area, floodlight and the dressing rooms are brought up to the required level to host this important match.” “We appreciate your contribution in helping us raise the level of African football with facilities as we continue to gain exposure to a global audience.”
