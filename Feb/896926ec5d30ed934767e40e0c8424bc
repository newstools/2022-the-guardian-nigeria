The new academic session for year 2022 has commenced. But it’s not devoid of its own challenges. The economic hardship being faced by Nigerians across every strata is taking a toll on schools as parents struggle to pay fees.
     
For school owners, like almost everything in the country, running cost and expenses have doubled, necessitating the need to hike fees. They argued that adjustment was necessary to accommodate increase in overheads and enable them to 
 remain afloat.
 
Stakeholders in the sector attributed the development to harsh economic realities that the country is going through. Speaking on the issue, proprietress, Gloryville School, Ebute Meta, Mrs Toyin Sode Idowu, blamed the exchange rate and continuous depreciation of naira as part of the challenge.
     
Idowu said the forex crisis was responsible for the high cost of things, including running of schools. She said:  “The cost of running a school on average increased by 100 per cent. The cost of living increased by 100 per cent. There is a need for schools to be able to, at least, cover their costs because they are businesses and not funded (partial or fully) organisations.
