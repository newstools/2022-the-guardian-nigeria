Former international, Friday Elahor, has commended referees officiating in the current Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season for their improved performance, saying their firm and fair handling of games have opened up the competition. According to Elaho, teams now win away matches unlike in the past where it was almost impossible for home teams to lose games. Enyimba of Aba, Kano  Pillars and other top teams have suffered shock defeats at home in the current domestic league season. Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, Elaho, who acknowledged that winning on the road is no longer new in modern football, said the away wins recorded so far is an indication that the NPFL is now in alignment with the rest of the world, where teams prepare well enough if they desire positive results. “I don’t think home defeat is a new thing in Europe and other parts of the world. It is not only in the NPFL that it happens. Look at what happened to Manchester City at the weekend when Tottenham Hotspur went there to beat them. “Sometime, this happens when a team is not well prepared for the encounter. It tells you that a team has to prepare well enough before any engagement so that no team will now start protesting that they were rubbed of victory, as it happens here in our league,” he said. Elaho, who played for some top clubs during his day in the domestic league, added: “The referees are now doing well and they deserve our commendation. Gone are the days when home fixtures are tagged a must win. But now that the referees have decided to put their house in order, everyone should commend them.” The former Brondby of Denmark midfielder picked out Plateau United, as a team determined to excel this season, saying their good form has seen them winning some away games.
