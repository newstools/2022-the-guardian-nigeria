The Floorball Association of Nigeria (FAN) has begun a grassroots development programme in schools across the country. The strategy, according to the association, is to comb select schools for hidden talents, who they will nurture to limelight. Speaking at the association’s maiden outing at the National Institute of Sport (NIS), Lagos, its Secretary General, Henry Oluoma, said coaches have been sent out to look for potential stars in the sport, adding that the world governing body in December spelt out how to move Floorball forward in Africa. The Germany-based administrator said he was given the mandate to ensure that the sport grows beyond its present position in the African continent. He revealed that some companies in Germany have promised to support the cause by donating Floorball equipment to Nigeria to aid speedy development of the game. Although president of FAN, Ms. Maduka Chinenye, blamed the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic for hindering the growth of the sport, she assured that all lost ground would be covered soon. Narrating how Nigeria conquered Africa with a depleted team (only seven players) in Cote d’Ivoire in 2018 under coach Freeman, the president said the association would organise a national championship within the next two months to select athletes to represent the country at the forthcoming African championship. Maduka also called on corporate bodies and well meaning Individuals to support Floorball in Nigeria, saying it is an Olympic sport that can win medals for the country in future games.
