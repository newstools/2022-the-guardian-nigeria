As part of their plot to launder the proceeds from the hack, the US Department Of Justice says that they purchased gold and NFTs and used some for personal use. So far, the government has seized $3.6 Billion in stolen Bitcoin linked to the hack. Describing themselves as “serial entrepreneurs” enthusiastic about Tech, Lichtenstein had transferred some money in bitcoin into his companies, Endpass, a crypto-wallet company and Demandpath, a company involved in “boutique micro-fund investing in the next generation of promising technologies.” In turn, Heather who has contributed articles to Inc. and Forbes, told the bank handling the account for her company, SalesFolk, that many of her clients wanted to pay her in Bitcoin. Besides this, she wanted to take some Bitcoin out of the ones her husband had given her for business expansion purposes. Watch a video of her telling us how she became a billionaire at 23.
