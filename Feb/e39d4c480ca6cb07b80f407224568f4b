In an effort to tackle digitalisation challenges in the workplace and advance technology-driven work experience in Africa, the Human Resource Expo Africa (HREA), organisers of industry-leading conferences, exhibitions and training, is set to hold its 2022 international work festival.
 
The Founder, HREA, Erefa Coker, said the program became germane to address digitalization hitches in the workplace to boost organisation productivity.
  
Coker spoke at a virtual press conference to announce its forth ‘International Work Festival 2022’ with the theme, “The Future of Work in a Technology-driven World (Work-Humans).”  When we bring speakers from across the world, it is to come and tell us their experience and how they are succeeding so that we can begin to practice it within our culture,” She said.
