Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal and the immediate past governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, have declared their intention to contest the 2023 presidency. Tambuwal is seeking to realise his ambition under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The former Speaker of the House of Representatives made his intention known, yesterday evening, after a high-level stakeholder meeting in Sokoto. Speaking at the declaration, Tambuwal said he is not only well prepared but also ready to fix the numerous problem of the country. He said he has distinguished himself not only as governor but also as a Speaker of the House of Representatives without any blemish or corruption tag. Okorocha, while declaring his intention in Abuja, said Nigeria needs a leader that can unite the people and give everyone a sense of belonging, adding that he is the best man for the job. He said: “Nigeria needs a compassionate leader that will listen to the needy, a leader that can give everyone a sense of belonging. If I say I will make Nigeria more united, believe me, I will do so.” He challenged other presidential aspirants to show proof of their ability to uphold the unity of Nigeria like he did over the years.
