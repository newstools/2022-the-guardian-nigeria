Barely three days after a gang of armed robbers attacked a bullion  van killing four people including two police officers at Idi Ape Iwo Road area, another tension broke out yesterday at Soka Area, as loyalists of Lamidi Mukaila, alias Auxiliary, leader of -Oyo State Motor Park Manager System and Yoruba self-determination fighter, Mr. Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, engaged in a free-for-all.
  
At about noon yesterday residents and motorists scampered for safety as the gangs displayed deadly weapons during the mayhem.
