• Resolves division over convention date
• Adopts consensus methodology for national chair
• APC ineligible to contest 2023 elections, PDP alleges After months of vacillation and doublespeak, the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) has officially allotted political offices, including the national chairmanship and Presidential slots to various geopolitical zones.
   
The issue of where the prospective national chairman of the party would come from has been at the root of delay in organising APC’s national convention, even as some stakeholders had expressed worry that the tenure of the Governor Mai Mala Buni’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) expired last December.
    
Last June, the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party ratified further extension of the interim committee’s tenure by another six months, which elapsed in December 2021.  In a statement by its national publicity secretary, Debo Ologunagba, the opposition party noted that APC’s postponement of its National Convention has validated the stance that “the APC is not a political party but a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) of strange bed fellows, ‘political buccaneers’ and ferocious power mongers on a mission to wreck our nation.” According to the opposition party, APC’s postponement of its National Convention had always been a fallout of the horrible infighting, backbiting and gang war by “political bandits” who are desperate for power and access to our national treasury. “That explains why their congresses and other activities are always marred by violence, bloodletting and killings,” the party declared. It claimed that the activities of the Mai Mala Buni Committee remained invalid and unconstitutional by virtue of Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, which bars a sitting governor from holding “any other executive office” in any capacity whatsoever while serving as a state governor. “The failure of the APC to hold a National Convention is therefore a clear warning to those aspiring for various positions in the 2023 election on its platform to note that with the APC, they are on a journey to nowhere,” the PDP mocked.
