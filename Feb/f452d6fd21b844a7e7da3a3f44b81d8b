As the contest for 2023 presidential election gathers momentum, political actors are intensifying strategies to ensure their candidate clinch party tickets and ultimately win the election. This is as Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (ABAT) Movement working committee was inaugurated with Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and other members of the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) acclaiming the national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
  
The movement was conceived and set up by members of Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC) in Lagos for the actualisation of the presidential ambition of the former Lagos State governor.
  
The Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Movement, James Odunmbaku, said members of the movement are committed to the realisation of the dream of Tinubu to become president of Nigeria in 2023, as part of efforts to get Nigeria back on track.  He disclosed that a 7-member committee had been set up in each of the 57 local councils in Lagos, with each committee headed by coordinator.
   
Danmole said that at the ward level, the movement maintained a similar committee structure of seven persons across the 377 wards, adding that registration to be part of the ward committee would be made open to residents in the coming days.
   
There were several goodwill messages from party leaders in the state that highlighted reasons why Tinubu is the best man for the job in 2023.
