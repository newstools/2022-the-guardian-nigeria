The African Peer Review Mechanism was established in 2003 as a specialised agency of the African Union that serves as a platform for sharing experiences and reinforcing best practices towards political stability, accelerated economic growth, and regional and continental integration as well as sustainable development. It further seeks to foster change in underlying deficiencies in governance and socio-economic development processes among member states. The Mechanism uses a holistic review process that distinguishes it from other institutions through inclusive dialogue, independent and objective reviews, peer learning and compliance monitoring.
