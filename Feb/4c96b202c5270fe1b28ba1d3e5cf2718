Living up to its reputation as one of EDUSKO’s top five schools in Nigeria, Rainbow College has announced an outstanding performance from its year 11 students, as they recorded yet another remarkable performance in the just concluded 2021/2022 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Speaking on the performance of its students, the college’s director of studies, Dr. Olayinka Oduwole, said the school recorded an overall performance where 93.79 per cent of grades in all subjects were A-B; and 99.42 per cent A-C grades in all subjects respectively. “We appreciate our teachers and students who continuously work hard to achieve these excellent results and hopes to continue raising the bar and making the best out of every child,” Oduwole said. Topping the performance of the previous year, the school boasts of more than six distinctions from 99 per cent of its students that participated in the examination. “This year’s result couldn’t have come at a better time as the school was recently awarded 2021/2024 British Council ISA Awards in celebration of her innovation and excellence across independent education sector,” the director added. As a pioneer in child education and development, Rainbow College, an offshoot of Pampers Private School has consistently provided a balance in moral and leadership development in its day and boarding schools in Lagos and Ogun states.
