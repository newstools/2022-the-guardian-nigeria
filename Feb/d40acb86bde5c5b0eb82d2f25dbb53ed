The newly reinstated Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State, Emeka Ibeh, has expressed the readiness of the party to focus on reconciliation of aggrieved members, to forge a common front ahead of the 2023 general elections. Ibeh expressed hope that his major target is to reconcile the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Senator Chris Ngige who he called the state’s party leader and Senator Andy Uba, to build a formidable team to wrest power from other parties. He hailed the stand of President Muhamadu Buari and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee in maintaining the rule of law. During an interview after a marathon meeting in Awka, yesterday, Ibeh said there is no victor and no vanquish in the court case sacking Basil Ejidike as the acting Chairman of the party in the state. According to him, his re-emergence is a victory for APC, since Ejidike who was his Deputy, remains part of the new leadership. While noting that the High Court’s recognition of his leadership and those of the Local Councils and Ward Executives is a welcome development, he said what remains uppermost to him is to heal the wounds that have bedeviled the party some years back. Meanwhile, a former legislator from Orumba North Constituency, Uchenna Okonkwo-Okom, said with the High Court judgment and the Court of Appeal judgment that reinstated Ibeh, the judiciary has continued to show that it is really the last bastion of the common man and is living up to its responsibility to the society. In a phone interview, yesterday, Okonkwo-Okom pointed out that the implication of the judgment was that those who desire to lead should test their popularity through democratic means, but not by electoral ambush.
