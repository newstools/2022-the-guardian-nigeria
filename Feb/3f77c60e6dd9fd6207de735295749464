The Minister of State for Environment,Sharon Ikeazor, has said that Nigeria’s wetlands are  rich in biodiversity and play key role in water purification, water storage, processing of carbon and other nutrients. Ikeazor, who stated this while celebrating 2022 Wetlands Day in Hadejia in Jigawa State, explained that  effective and sustainably managed healthy ecosystem are vital in addressing socio-economic challenges by creating millions of jobs in sectors such as forestry, fisheries, agriculture and tourism. She said: “Nigeria is one of the internationally recognised wetlands in the world. Majority of these wetlands are found in Niger Delta, Benue and Chad Basin and along the entire Coast of Nigeria.” The minister said coastal and inland wetlands are popular locations for tourism and recreational activities, offering income opportunities for local communities. Ikeazor regretted that ecosystems are being threatened due to population pressure, poverty, deforestation, intensive cultivation, oil, gas and industrial waste pollution, coastal and marine erosion, over grazing as well as climate change.
