For organisations looking to protect themselves and prevent their identities from being misused or stolen, the highest priority remains to have strong passwords.
 
These were the words of Modern Workplace and Security Business Group Lead for Microsoft Middle East and Africa Emerging Markets, Mohamed El Nemr, in Lagos.
   
He said there could be little doubt that cybercriminals have firms’ passwords in their sights. This is particularly the case in Africa where businesses are often more prone to cyber-attacks than companies anywhere else in the world.  However, he said the consequences of a data breach are now front of mind for 64 per cent of companies in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) according to current Microsoft-IDC research. In fact, risk experts across MEA rank cyber incidents as the second highest risk facing the region, largely because of the increase in both size and expense of data breaches.
