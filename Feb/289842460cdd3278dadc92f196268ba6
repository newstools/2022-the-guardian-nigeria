Sir: The year 2021 was indeed a busy year, on many fronts, for the Nigerian Navy. The year kicked off with a change of guard at the helm of the service with the appointment of the then Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo, at the time the director, Procurement at Defence Space Administration (DSA), as the 21st Chief of the Naval Staff.
 
Immediately upon assuming office, the new chief unveiled his vision for the service: “To leverage on all factors of national location, technology, training, teamwork and synergy to re-energise the Nigerian Navy and enhance her as a well-motivated and ready Naval Force in the discharge of her constitutional mandate and other assigned tasks in fulfilment of national security objectives.”  As the 21st Chief of the Naval Staff celebrates his first anniversary in office, as well as prepares for the 66th anniversary of the Nigerian Navy, later in the year, there is no doubt that the service today is different from the one that existed when Buhari assumed office in 2015: today’s Nigerian Navy is much-better equipped, more confident, more in tune with the civil populace and more determined than ever to fulfill its operational mandate as part of the
Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. • Samuel Olorunniwa.
