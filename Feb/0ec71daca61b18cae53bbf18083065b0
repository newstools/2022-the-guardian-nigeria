Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, has demanded justice in the murder case of five-year-old Hanifa Abubakar, who was recently kidnapped and killed by Abdulmaliq Tanko, the proprietor of the school she attended. The first lady made the request, yesterday, during her visit to commiserate with the Abubakars in Kano State. Speaking with journalists at Kano Government House, Mrs. Buhari insisted that appropriate punishment must be meted out to the culprits to serve as a deterrent to other criminal-minded people.
