Lower ab exercises do not only sculpt your hips, lower stomach and back, but they also improve balance, posture and are a known remedy for back pain. Typically standard ab workouts focus on the upper abs and may leave lower abs unattended to. Here are 7 lower ab workouts for a much stronger core to fix this. To do this, start off with your yoga mat laid. Next, lay on the mat with your lower back pushing against the mat. Place your hands behind your head and gently lift your head off the ground. Lift your legs, and pull your knee back to your opposite elbow before extending it. Do this on each side, making sure to keep your legs elevated. 2. Reverse Crunch The reverse crunch shouldn’t be much harder if you can do a crunch. Start off laying with your back on a mat. Place your hands on your hips, making sure to press your lower bank into the flow. Finally, bend your knees, thrusting your legs up as you exhale, inhale and lower your legs. Repeat this on each side. 3. Floor Windshield Wipers: Lay on your back with your arms spread out on both sides on you, forming the shape ‘T’. Next, lift your legs straight into the air, dropping your legs to each side without rotating your upper body. Pull your legs back to the other side and continue. 4. Iron Butterfly Okay, one exercise without you having to lay down. Sit on a mat with your legs placed together and extended in front of you. Your arms should be at the same level as your shoulders. Bend your knees and pull your legs into your chest, making sure your back doesn’t arch. Finally, rotate your arms around your midline, wrapping them around your knees. After which, return to your starting position before repeating. 5. Hip Raise Abs Lay on your back, making sure to keep your legs straight before drawing them to your spine. Lift your legs into the air, making sure to raise your hips off the floor. Roll your hips down, dropping your feet to the floor slowly. 6. Butterfly Crunch: Begin by laying backwards on the floor with your legs extended, keeping your hands at either side of your head. Lift your shoulders and torso off the floor, making sure to keep your core engaged. Lift your legs slightly off the ground allowing them to hover. Then crunch up, making sure to aim the first elbow at the opposing kee, bending your legs to your chest. Hold this position for a second or two before returning to your start position and switching sides. A pro tip is to keep your legs bent the whole time so that when you come up for the crunch twist, you’ll have your elbow meet your opposite knee and lower back down. 7. Seated Knee Tuck Sit down in a V position and bend your knees. You can then extend both your legs and engage your core, crunching your legs and torso towards one another. For better balance, you can place your hands on the ground. Return to your start position and repeat. While lower ab workouts effectively improve core strength, there are safety precautions to be adopted while doing them. If you have lower back injuries or pain, you should probably skip this. It is also not advisable for pregnant women to engage in lower ab exercises. In the same way, if you experience any pain while making these moves, strengthen your core with different exercises before trying again.
