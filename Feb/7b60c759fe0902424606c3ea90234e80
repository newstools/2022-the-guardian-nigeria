Reacting to market performance last week, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In the short term, we expect the bulls to continue to rotate their portfolio towards dividend-paying stocks ahead of 2021FY dividend declarations, even as institutional investors continue to search for clues on the direction of yields in the fixed income market. “However, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Analysts at Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage also said: “We saw a slight recovery in the banking space today, however, the market traded bearishly as most of the sectors closed in the red. We expect the new week to start in mixed sentiments, amid cherry-picking activities.” Further breakdown of last week’s trading showed that a total of 24,350 units of exchange-traded funds (ETF) valued at N574,834.85 were traded last week in 38 deals compared to 7,900 units valued at N1.8 million transacted in 38 deals during the preceding week. Similarly, 61,682 units of bonds worth N63.3 million were traded in eight deals compared with a total of 57,971 units valued at N59.3 million transacted in 15 deals within the same period. On the price movement chart, the equities market witnessed a sustained bullish trend across sectors, as investors continue to cherry-pick stocks with attractive dividend yields ahead of 2021 full-year dividend declarations. Notably, bargain hunting in Seplat (+10.1 per cent), Presco (+7.6 per cent), GTCO (+7.2 per cent), MTNN (+5.4 per cent) and Dangote Cement (+5.5 per cent) drove the weekly gain. Consequently, the All-Share index and market capitalisation appreciated by 2.33 per cent to close the week at 47,279.92 and N25.477 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished higher except NGX Insurance and NGX Consumer Goods indices, which depreciated by 1.93 per cent and 0.81 per cent while the NGX ASem, and NGX Sovereign bond indices closed flat. 42 equities recorded price appreciation last week, lower than 44 equities in the preceding week. 35 equities depreciated, higher than 33 equities in the preceding week.
