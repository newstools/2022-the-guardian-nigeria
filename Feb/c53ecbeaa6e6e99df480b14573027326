Kano State Public Complaints and Anti Corruption Commission has arrested 12 members of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), who were allegedly involved in selling fuel above official price. Chairman of the commission, Mahmoud Balarabe, told journalists in Kano, yesterday, that his officers uncovered some filling stations selling fuel at N250 per litre, instead of the N165 official price. The anti-graft boss said the violators, allegedly caught red handed, clearly contradicted Federal Government official prices. Balarabe lamented the ungodly act of some IPMAN members at a time the masses are struggling to survive, adding that government would not condone the unpatriotic act of some petroleum marketers. His words: “In fact, when I heard about the unilateral increase in price of the pump price, I tried to reach out to the state chairman of IPMAN, Bashir Danmallam; but he rejected all my calls and text messages. “We cannot allow some individuals to use this opportunity to decide on the petrol pump price at the detriment of our people. We must be seen protecting the interest of the generality of the citizens, that was why we will not allow them to do as they wish.” When contacted, Danmallam said he had not been briefed about the issue. The Kano anti graft body insisted that it would continue to arrest any filling station found selling fuel above official price.
