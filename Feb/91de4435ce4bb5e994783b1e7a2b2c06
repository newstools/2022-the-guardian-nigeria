Northern youths under the aegis of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) has cautioned the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, to tread cautiously over the alleged harassment and intimidation of northerners with the state’s security outfit, Amotekun. The group said it would not condone further harassment of northerners in the state. A statement signed by the forum’s National President, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, took a swipe at the Ondo State government, accusing the governor of looking the other way while northerners were allegedly arrested by armed militia disguised as Amotekun on trumped-up charges. The AYCF condemned the activities of armed gangs masquerading as security agents in a nation where the police, the DSS, NSCDC and others are the only recognised enforcers of law and order. Shettima said: “We wish to sound a strong note of warning that the Ondo State Government should stop turning a blind eye to the attack on innocent Nigerians from the North, who are doing legitimate business in the state. “If the people of Northern Nigeria had taken the same path of extra-judicial harassment, by now no indigene of Ondo State would have been living and doing business in the region. “We have had enough of this unbridled harassment and intimidation of northerners in Ondo State and we are beginning to see that the disposition of the governor is what has emboldened extra-judicial militia outfits to make innocent northerners in Ondo the butt of shameful intimidation.”
