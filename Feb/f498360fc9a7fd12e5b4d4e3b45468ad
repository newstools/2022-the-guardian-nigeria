The Lagos State Parking Authority (LASPA) has solicited support of all citizens in its quest to stop all forms of illegal parking that impedes on free flow of traffic and its capacity to deliver service to the people. The General Manager of the agency, Adebisi Adelabu, disclosed this recently, while she was analysing the mandate of her agency. She noted that parking problems have been one of the thorniest issues affecting the economy and the environment, adding that the state government can no longer fold its hands, hence, the need for a holistic approach regulating the cause and effects having gridlock on the roads. While urging Lagosians to shun any act of indiscriminate parking, which contributes greatly to traffic congestion, Adelabu called on all park operators (commercial and non-commercial) to register with the agency for operating permit, adding that enforcement which was earlier slated for February, 2022 has been shifted to 1st March, 2022 to give room for further conformity and adherence. She explained that in line with the first pillar of the THEME’S Agenda of which Traffic Management and Transportation is key, parking space issues needed to be addressed to reduce travel time impeded upon by traffic and make the state a 21st century running economy for its residents in the short and long term. Adelabu maintained that the imbalance between parking demand and parking supply has been the main reason for the metropolis’ unregularised parking problems contributing to the traffic congestion, accident, and environmental pollution which the agency is fervently poised to address. Highlighting the agency’s statutory responsibilities further, the LASPA GM also stated that the agency is optimising the On and Off street parking supplies, setback options, registration of existing private parks operators to maximise urban public spaces in finding lasting solutions to parking induced traffic. She also revealed that while the State Government is building and transforming the parking infrastructures within the metropolis, there is the need for provision of available real time parking information for city users planning to improve the overall quality of the parking system in the state.
