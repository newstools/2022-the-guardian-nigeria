Even though previous opinion articles, commentaries and interventions by this author favoured or supported policies and decisions of the Delta State government, it will, however, for reasons considered very logical, rational and practical to say that the same state government will definitely feel hesitant as to why they should read this present piece. Or accept the content of solution it proffers as beneficial and helpful to the real development in the state education sector, as the piece stoutly opposes the state government’s inconsiderate decision, and describes as ill-timed, the recent hikes in students’ fees in virtually all the state-owned institutions of higher learning.
 
Aside from the belief that in Nigeria, once a direction is chosen by an average Nigerian leader, instead of examining the process meticulously and setting the right course, many obstinately persist with the execution of such plans regardless of a minor or major shift in circumstance. I have also in the past few weeks read with dismay, so many articles, commentaries and analyses that scantily suggest why the Delta State Government should not be blamed for the thoughtless hike in school fees across Delta State-owned institutions of higher learning.
