According to the convener of MGI League, Lukman Owolabi, the league, which is divided into divisions A and B, has been successful with clubs that are eager to register for the event. “This year has witnessed a large turnout of players attracted by the progress of the league. Our target is to get more Nigerians involved in scrabble, which Nigeria is the number one country in the world. “The League attracts the best and upcoming stars in scrabble from across the country, so, the standard is very high. “All MGI needs is more sponsors to keep the stake high,” he said.
