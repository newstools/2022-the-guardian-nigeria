The sexual assault case was filed against the popular artiste by a Jane Doe whose alleged relationship with Songz was first consensual but later changed on March 24, 2016.   The anonymous lady alleged that she went to a house party organised by the Trey Songz, was invited upstairs and then raped by Songz despite telling him she did not want to have anal sex. The woman alleges Songz removed her pants when they got to the room, and held her down, where he forcibly inserted his penis into her anus. She notes that she screamed during the ordeal begging him to stop. The woman  also claims that she went to the hospital but was scared to disclose to  them, the name of the artist after she was examined. She said that the examination established that there was “severe anal tearing that could require surgery.” The case against the singer is not the first as he currently has two rape cases against him. However, representatives of the artiste deny the allegations brought against Songz: “Earlier today, the attorney who drafted this suit was credibly accused of trying to pay a woman to falsely accuse Trey,” the rep said in a revised statement. “Hours later, that same attorney has filed this suit on behalf of an anonymous client. It isn’t hard to see what’s happening here, and it is a shame for genuine victims of sexual assault.” The lawyer Ariel Mitchell representing Jauhara Jeffries, one of the two women accusing the singer of assaulting her in a night club on New Year’s Eve in 2017 denied Songz’s legal team’s accusation that she was tampering with the case by attempting  to bribe witnesses. “This is nothing more than bullying and an attempt to silence counsel and the many victims who have been assaulted by Defendant Songz and will be vigorously defended in court. “I will further be exonerated as I was when this allegation was previously made by Defendant Songz’s prior attorney.” The three cases are still ongoing.
