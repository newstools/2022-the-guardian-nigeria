Seeks new investigators The family of Mr. Henry Ubanna Iroegbu, who was allegedly murdered in his village on December 28, 2021, has called for fresh investigation into the matter. The deceased, who hailed from Umuoma Onicha Nworie in Ezinihitte, Mbaise Local Council of Imo State, was allegedly murdered in his village. But, the family, through their counsel,  Chief H.N. Duroha Duroha, has faulted the investigation so far, on the ground that police investigators have refused to arrest the suspect but have been hobnobbing with him. In a protest letter titled: “Protest against shoddy and biased investigation, the family lawyer said, “though the murder case is currently being investigated by  Zone 9 CID, it is strange that to date, police have not found the need to arrest the suspect.” The letter was addressed to the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in charge of Zone 9 in Umuahia,   the Abia State capital. In his letter dated February 4, 2022, which acknowledged copy was sighted by The Guardian, the lawyer urged the AIG to “cause investigation into the matter to go to another section/team for proper investigation and possible prosecution. According to him,  the present investigators have been compromised so they are exhibiting crass bias with attendant shoddy Investigation. He stressed that with the present investigating team, the case will never be adequately investigated, adding that members of the community have become agitated by the unhealthy development. Another lawyer to the family, Chief Emenike Emerson Azubuike, said it was total injustice to the family, who reported the matter as complainants at the State CID, Owerri in Imo State to be made suspects at Zone 9 in Umuahia.
   
He alleged that it was a ploy to scare witnesses to the deceased from coming to testify. The lawyer urged the AIG to correct the injustice.
