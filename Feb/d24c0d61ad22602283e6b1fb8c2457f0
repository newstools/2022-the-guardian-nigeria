The Ondo State Government has commenced the distribution of empowerment grants to entrepreneurs within the state, to scale up their businesses. Through the Ondo State Entrepreneurship Agency (ONDEA), the beneficiaries received items ranging from basic equipment to block making machines, industrial sewing machines, industrial ovens, generators, pumping machines and laptops, among others. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had launched a couple of schemes through the new agency, one of which is the Entrepreneurship Development Training (EDT) programme. Last year, 3,495 entrepreneurs were trained, and as a follow-up to the programme, the agency commenced the empowerment of successful participants with the tools and equipment. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Entrepreneurship Development, Dr. Summy Smart Francis, said the state is committed to seeing small businesses thrive as they are seen as employers of labour and important stakeholders in the state economy when it comes to revenue generation and economic development. “Qualified beneficiaries are excited about this initiative because it clearly shows that the government is not relenting in its effort to encourage and equip job makers within the state with all the needed support. “This programme and equipment grant started in the early weeks of January 2022 and will run for three consecutive months. It is indeed a great start for entrepreneurs within the state,” he said.
