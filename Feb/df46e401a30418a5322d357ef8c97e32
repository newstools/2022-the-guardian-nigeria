Xander Schauffele joined the likes of Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, and other big-time PGA Tour players that have pledged their loyalty to the Tour recently, reports brobible.com. Schauffele released a statement on Wednesday evening addressing Saudi Golf League rumors, and the wording he used throughout the entire statement was truly bizarre. First and foremost, Schauffele began by saying he never took action that he would entertain the Saudi Golf League over the PGA Tour. He then strangely says he wasn’t going to make a statement but for some reason felt that he needed to on Wednesday night. Schauffele follows that up by writing perhaps the worst-worded paragraph in PR history. “My team had been instructed to do due diligence on this matter, thus we have met and discussed with representatives of the SGL/LIV, only to come to the conclusion that the SGL isn’t close to a finished product or business model.” That’s certainly one way to say you’re not leaving the Tour for the SGL. Schauffele could have said ‘I’m pledging my loyalty to the PGA Tour and never once considered leaving for the Saudi Golf League.’ Instead, Schauffele essentially says ‘I’m not going to the SGL because it’s not a finished product and their business model is terrible.’ You can appreciate Schauffele being honest about him and his team meeting with the Saudis, but you can also criticize his choice of words. The 28-year-old would have been praised if he called out the Saudis and their horrific human rights practices, but instead went with whatever that was. Also, Schauffele could have simply not said anything. Perhaps he felt he needed to get out ahead of things seeing as how he admitted to meeting with representatives, however. Some PGA Tour players seem to think they have to come out and make these statements about being loyal to the Tour because one player, Phil Mickelson, said some bad things. The golf world reacted with plenty of confusion and criticism toward Schauffele’s statement
