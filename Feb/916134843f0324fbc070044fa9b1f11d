The Kwara Government has threatened to sanction violators of its compulsory monthly sanitation programme. The state Ministry of Environment and Forestry warned that the violators would be sanctioned by mobile courts stationed at designated points across the state. This is contained in a statement signed by Mrs Okanlawon Taiwo, the Press Secretary of the ministry. It said that the monthly exercise for the month of February would hold on Feb. 26 from 7 a.m to 9 a.m. Taiwo said that members of the public are expected to fully participate in sanitation by cleaning their residential and business environments. “Everybody is expected to stay at home, to clean up their surroundings. “There will be no vehicular and human movement, except those on essential services. “Waste management trucks will be on the streets for waste collection and disposal to the final dump site, during the exercise,” she said. The press secretary said that the monitoring agencies would be on the ground to ensure compliance, adding that the exercise will be strictly observed across the 16 local government areas of the state.
