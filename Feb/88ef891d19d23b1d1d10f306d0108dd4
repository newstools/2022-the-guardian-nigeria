The Federal High Court in Abuja, yesterday, adjourned a suit filed by the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu against the Department of State Services (DSS), its Director General and Attorney General of the Federation to February 28, 2022. In the suit before Justice Taiwo Taiwo, the IPOB leaders sued the DSS and AGF over alleged poor medical attention being accorded him in the DSS detention facility and enforcement of his fundamental rights, which he claimed, had been violated. One of Kanu’s counsel, Maxwell Opara, instituted the case in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/1585/21, in which he prayed the court to order the respondents to allow him to appoint a doctor of his choice from a certified government hospital to review his medical files. Kanu is also seeking an order to allow him access to facility and material to practice of his religion, as well as direct the respondents to release him from detention, among other prayers. On its part, the AGF’s office filed a motion for extension of time within which to file its counter affidavit in opposition to the suit, after which Justice Taiwo adjourned further hearing to February 28.
