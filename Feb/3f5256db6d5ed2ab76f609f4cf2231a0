Dressed as the Joker and the Queen, the newest collaboration comes after Ed who in a recent interview gave a hint of the new hit set to drop. To announce its release, Ed tweeted: “The joker and queen featuring @taylorswift13 is out right now. Me and Taylor first met and wrote + recorded our first song together in 2012, ten years ago now, I’m so so honoured to have her on this song.’’ He went on to add, ‘’Not only is she the best singer/songwriter in the world but she’s also a very close friend. I’m very lucky to have her in my life.’’ This is the fourth time the artistes will be collaborating. Ed, 30, and Taylor, 32, reunited with the same cast from a previous collaboration on ‘Everything Has Changed’. The ballad describes the love story of two teenagers, Ava and Jack, who were  going to the university. With the release of The Joker And The Queen, Taylor wrote: “This video makes me think of our friendship all these years… also can’t believe Jack & Ava from the Everything Has Changed video came back and did this!! Nostalgic heaven! (sic)” In the chorus of the song, Ed sings: “And I know you could fall for a thousand kings/And hearts that would give you a diamond ring. When I fold, you see the best in me/The joker and the queen.” See the full video HERE:
