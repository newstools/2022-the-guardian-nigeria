Transactions on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) reopened on a downturn, yesterday, occasioned by sell-off in 23 stocks, as market capitalisation depreciated by N75 billion. Specifically, at the close of transactions the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 139.02 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.30 per cent, to close at 47,063.28 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N75 billion to close at N25.361 trillion. The market negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are: Airtel Africa, Nigerian Exchange Group (NGXGroup), BUA Foods, Custodian Investment and Lafarge Africa. Analysts at United Capital Plc said investors would continue to book profits on positions that have appreciated significantly in the past weeks. “From the large cap stocks, we expect the profit taking to extend to their mid-cap and small-cap out-performers. That said, with the big banks likely to release their full year 2021 numbers within the next two weeks, we expect investors to begin to take positions in names expected to deliver outperforming numbers while declaring strong dividend payments,” they told The Guardian. Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “Positive activity in names like GUINNESS continue to lift the consumer goods sector, as increased buy interest amid strong valuations push the price higher. We are likely to see another bearish close due to profit taking activities, while market trades mixed.”
