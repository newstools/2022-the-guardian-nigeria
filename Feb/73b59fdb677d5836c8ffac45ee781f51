• Agency didn’t pick him up, says spokesman
• NIA denies plot to compromise case on ex-DG Executive Director of International Press Institute and former President of National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Mr. Lanre Arogundade, has been released, following his arrest by officials of the Department of State Services. Arogundade was arrested on his arrival from The Gambia at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, yesterday. In a tweet, hours later, the International Press Centre confirmed his release, saying, “M. Arogundade @lanreipc has been released, and his passport has been returned to him. Thank you all.” DSS spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, however, said the secret police did not arrest Arogundade, describing the report as falsehood perpetrated by mischief-makers. “Nobody was arrested. Ask Lanre himself. It was just a small mix-up that didn’t last up to two seconds,” Afunanya said. Meanwhile, lawyers for the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) have rebuffed allegations in the media of plots by the security outfit to compromise a court case on the dismissal of erstwhile Acting Director General, Mohammed Dauda. Acting on behalf of NIA in a letter dated February 4, 2022 and addressed to Dauda’s lawyer, Chief Kanu Agabi, Wale Adesokan (SAN) expressed concern over a communication, which alleged NIA was plotting to arrest Dauda.
