A Nigerian flagged Motor Vessel, MV VIGEO ADEBOLA, which was reported distressed midstream Federal Ocean Terminal (FOT) Onne, due to operational error, has been moved to a better location away from the FOT Onne Channel. The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), while disclosing this said the vessel had a port list on February 10, 2022 due to the fact that it received potable fresh water from a barge, all in the port fresh water tank. The agency noted that the vessel owners were able to correct the list on February 13, 2022, by transferring some of the potable fresh water to the starboard side to have an even keel. Throughout this period, the Surveyors from NIMASA constantly monitored the vessel until the operation was completed and the vessel relocated. According to the agency, it is noteworthy that at no point was the vessel having a negative metacentric height, as the  owners and captains were assured of the safety of navigation on the channel. The Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, gave the assurance that the agency would continue to work with relevant authorities and stakeholders in ensuring the waterways and channels are safe for navigation. “Let me use this opportunity to assure vessel owners, captains and all stakeholders of the Agency’s commitment to its mandate, which includes maritime safety, geared towards the safety of navigation of vessels in Nigerian territorial waters”, Jamoh said.
