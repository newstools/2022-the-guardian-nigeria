Association of Childhood Education Practitioners (ACEP) has appealed to Kano State government to reconsider reopening of private schools shut in the wake of the murder of five-year old Hanifa Abubakar.
 
While commiserating with the deceased family over the loss, ACEP National President, Hajia Islamiat Olaitan Oshodi, appealled to Governor. Abdullah Ganduje to bear in mind that private schools exist because government is unable to satisfy citizens’ demand for qualitative education.
 
The state government had in the wake of Hanifa’s death directed that all private schools registration licence be withdrawn and closed down for re-registration.
 
But ACEP, while appealing to the governor  to reconsider his stance,  said private schools should be seen as partners, while the bad eggs should be identified and dealt with within the laws of the land.  The detrimental impact is on the individuals, their families and society. ACEP believes that re-registration or any form of inspection of schools can take place without disrupting school life,” Oshodi said.
 
The group welcomed government’s plan to set up a committee to review and validate licenses of private schools in the state. 
 
“As a foremost NGO, we are ready to support government in this regard, and members are ready, willing and able to provide their professional inputs.
