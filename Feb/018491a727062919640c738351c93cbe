The national trials for the 2022 Commonwealth Games will begin today at the Sports Hall of the Molade Okoya-Thomas, Teslim Balogun Stadium. The event ends on Friday. Judokas, who arrived in Lagos, yesterday, for registration, will jostle for placement in the seven weight men and women categories. President of the Nigerian Judo Federation, Musa Oshodi, said athletes from across the country will take part in the trials, which is the only platform to pick the country’s representatives at the Games, which holds between July 28 and August 28, 2022 in Birmingham. While canvassing the media’s support for the newly elected board of the federation, Oshodi said his federation would bring life back the into sport. “Our primary assignment is to make judokas happy by organising many tournaments, and providing good welfare package. Henceforth, judokas won’t be training without reasons for it. “After this trials, we will call winners in these categories to camp to continue the drills for the Commonwealth Games,” Oshodi said. Meanwhile, the Local Organising Committee, headed by the Vice President of the federation, Mrs. Loveth Howell, has pledged hitch-free trials, adding that all necessary logistics to ensure that the judokas have a good tournament have been put in place.
