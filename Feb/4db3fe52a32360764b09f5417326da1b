Seventeen persons were burnt to death yesterday morning when a tanker caught fire on the ever-busy Lagos-Ibadan expressway. The Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), which confirmed the incident, said it occurred around 5.00 am by the Isara bridge stretch of the highway with two vehicles with registration number ZT 728 KLD (Mazda bus) and a nondescript tanker involved. The spokesperson of the FRSC in Ogun, Florence Okpe, explained that 14 of the bodies were burnt beyond recognition, adding that the FRSC operatives were able to identify one man, one woman and a girl. “The total number of people involved is not ascertained, but a total of 17 bodies (killed) have been identified. “One male, one female and one female child only have been identified, while others were burnt beyond recognition,” she said. Okpe explained that the tanker had a head-on collision with the Mazda bus. “The suspected causes of the fatal crash were route violation and dangerous driving, which resulted to head-on collision and fire outbreak. “The vehicles are partially obstructing the service lane. The Nigeria Police Isara and the FOS Morgue by services Isara have been informed. FRSC personnel from Ogere are on the ground managing the situation,” she said. She added that the Sector Commander, FRSC Ogun, described the crash as an avoidable one if cautions were put in place and traffic rules and regulations were obeyed. “He commiserated with the family of the crash victims and enjoined them to contact FRSC Ogere for more information about the crash,” Okpe said.
