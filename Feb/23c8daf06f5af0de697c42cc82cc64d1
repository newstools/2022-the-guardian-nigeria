Download logo President Cyril Ramaphosa has, by mutual agreement, terminated the employment contract of the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS) General Khehla Sitole with effect from 31 March 2022.  President Ramaphosa and General Sitole have agreed that the early termination of the Commissioner’s contract is in the best interests of the country. The time until General Sitole’s departure will enable a proper handover of various tasks, including all ongoing investigations, to one of the senior members of the team at the SAPS that had been assisting General Sitole. President Ramaphosa said: “I am grateful to General Sitole for the constructive discussions we have had over the termination of his position as National Commissioner. I wish to convey my appreciation to General Sitole for his service to the nation over many years in the SAPS. I wish him the best in his future endeavours.” An announcement will be made in due course on filling the position of SAPS National Commissioner following General Sitole’s departure.
