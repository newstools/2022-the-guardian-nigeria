Liverpool teammates, Mohamed Salah of Egypt and Sadio Mane of Senegal, will come up against each other in the Africa Cup of Nations final tomorrow at 8.00 p.m., as the 2017 runners-up take on 2019 runners-up. With a pay-per-day option, football fans can see all the best action of the match live and in HD on StarTimes’ World Football channel. The Egyptian Pharaohs are chasing a record-extending eighth African crown, while Senegal’s Teranga Lions anticipate their first title. Egypt defeated hosts, Cameroun, 3-1 on penalties at the end of a goalless 120 minutes in Yaoundé on Thursday.
This was Egypt’s third extra time win in the tournament, after defeating Cote d’Ivoire in the last 16 and Morocco in the quarterfinals. Senegal overcame Burkina Faso 3-1 in normal time in their semifinal match.
Among European-based stars at AFCON, Mane’s big influence in matches involving Senegal is only comparable to Liverpool teammate, Salah’s influence on Egypt. Neither player has had the honour of lifting the trophy so far in their illustrious careers. Speaking on the match, StarTimes Nigeria PR Manager, Lazarus Ibeabuchi, said: “Football lovers in Nigeria can look forward to this exciting showpiece on StarTimes at the most affordable rate in the market with an option to pay-per-day, which is N320 for classic subscribers (antenna users) and N400 for subscribers on super bouquet (StarTimes dish users). “Active subscribers can watch on the go by downloading StarTimes ON mobile app and linking it to their decoders, at no extra cost, to access the same content on up to three mobile devices.
