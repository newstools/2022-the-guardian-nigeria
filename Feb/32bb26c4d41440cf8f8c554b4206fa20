14 parties sponsor 473 candidates for FCT elections
Ahead of the February 12 Federal Capital Territory (FCT) area councils’ election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has warned politicians against violence, insisting no one will benefit from disruption of the process. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, stated this while speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting on the poll organised by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), yesterday, in Abuja. Stressing the importance of peace to the successful conduct of the elections, Yakubu assured that INEC would protect the integrity of the process. According to him, all eyes are on its officials, be they ad hoc or regular, to ensure they strictly abide by the rules. “All parties, candidates and their supporters should do the same. No one will benefit from disruption of the process or other acts of bad behaviour. Let the voters in the FCT choose their leaders in a free, fair and peaceful contest,” he said. He disclosed that the commission listed 473 candidates sponsored by 14 political parties for the poll after the period for substitution and withdrawal of candidates as provided by law. According to him, 110 candidates are vying for the leadership of the six area councils, while 363 others are competing for 62 councillorship positions. He noted that the FCT is a leading light in Nigeria with its regular and well-conducted area council polls, adding that each political party has the chance of winning an election in the nation’s capital.
