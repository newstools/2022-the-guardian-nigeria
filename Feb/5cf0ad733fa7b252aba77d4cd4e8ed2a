• Co-opts hoteliers, parents to fight new menace
• Demands legal system to prosecute erring parents Chairman of Amotekun Council of Commanders, South-West Security Network, Adetunji Adeleye, has listed Internet fraudsters, popularly known as “Yahoo-boys,” as new emerging insecurity menace in the South-West. Adeleye, who is the state Commander of Ondo State Security Network, stated this, yesterday, while speaking with journalists in Akure, adding: “The menace of ‘Yahoo boys’ and ritual killings is what is taking the turn of the day.” He decried the recent upsurge in the involvement of young people in fraudulent activities in the state and South-West at large, adding that some of the Internet fraudsters involve in human rituals for money purposes, termed: “Yahoo plus.” Adeleye, who is also the Special Adviser to the Governor on Security Matters, stressed that hoteliers in the state have great roles to play in reducing the new trend among the youths. The chairman, however, added that some parents were culpable of the crime, recounting that “I want to say that the majority of the parents of these boys know what their children do, adding: Coming home with Lexus cars, students in 200 level buying houses and cars for their parents, and they know that they don’t have any legitimate job. “They are accomplices. I am looking forward to a situation that the legal system will have a grip on such parents. The decadence is a big failure from the family setting. “There is no way your ward will be misbehaving to such an extent that you will not know, otherwise you have failed as a parent.”
