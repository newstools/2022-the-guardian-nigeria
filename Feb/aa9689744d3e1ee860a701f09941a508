By next week, we will sit and deliberate on how to move the club forward, we have to hit the ground running in time. “The capital project is to be done. When you look at the golf course now, if you want to make it green all through the year, we need to have water sprint glass. There is need to work on the bunkers so that they are not kick and hard.” He highlighted the need to introduce cart pass for golf cart at all times, “including rainy season, and for trucks and other vehicles that come into the course. There are many things that need to be done.”
