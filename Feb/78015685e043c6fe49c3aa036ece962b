The Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), New Era, has urged Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, All Progressives Congress National Leader, Bola Tinubu, South-West governors and Yoruba monarchs to expedite action and secure the release of the Yoruba nation agitator, Chief Sunday Adeyemo, popularly called Sunday ‘Igboho’, from incarceration. National Publicity Secretary of the Yoruba group, Sina Akinpelu, gave the charge, yesterday, while speaking with The Guardian in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, on the travail and trial of Sunday Igboho in Benin Republic. Concerned by his continued incarceration, the OPC said it is imperative for all the prominent Yoruba leaders to intervene and rescue Igboho. Akinpelu said: “We are calling on all the Yoruba monarchs, governors, religious leaders and political leaders to rally round to ensure the release of Igboho from incarceration. “Tinubu is our father in South-West while Prof. Osinbajo is the number one political office holder in the entire South-West and number two in the country. If Osinbajo represents the Yoruba, he knows that one of his foot soldiers has been captured by the government. He should help to secure his release. All of them should use their influence to ensure the release of the Yoruba nation agitator.” The Yoruba group national publicity secretary, who lamented that the arrest of Igboho had weakened other agitators and distract the struggle, warned those who do not have details about Igboho’s case to stop writing hogwash on social media, saying: “They should do more investigation before saying anything.”
