How To Wear Red Lipsticks Like A Pro Here are some timeless pro tips for a flawless look before we consider the right red lipstick shade for your skin tone. Before you throw on red lipstick, take some time to think about what you plan to do with your eyeshadow and blush. Whatever you do, make sure to use a red lip liner with your red lipstick for an added touch of colour. This adds an extra touch of colour to your lipstick, ensuring it lasts longer.

Keep things simple with a more natural face beat for a daytime look and complimented by a red lipstick. You can throw on some smoky eyeshadow for your nighttime look and finish up with a red lipstick. Whatever you do, your red lipstick should also match your outfit choice. All black outfit? Throw on some red lipstick. Have a touch of red in your look? Use a different shade of red for your lipstick. The first rule to using red lipstick is to match your lipstick shade to your skin colour; try as many as you want. You’d definitely find something that matches. When you do find the perfect red lipstick shade, you can create a subtle, natural colour by applying some lip balm first. Start from the centre and dab outwards to create a stained lip look. Whether you choose a sheer texture lipstick or bold matte lipstick, it’s important to pay attention to its texture. You can try a sheer texture before committing to bold matte looks. Best Red Lipstick Shade For Your Skin Tone Opt for blue-based cool-toned reds for cool undertones: These red lipsticks complement fair skins, brightening the skin tone. Oh! And they not only complement cool undertones making your lips pop, but they also make your teeth look whiter. Warm or neutral tones: red lipsticks with warm and orange undertones are the way to go. Orange-red lipsticks highlight your skin’s natural glow, and the best way to nail this completely is to keep everything else simple with a warm bronzer and blush. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1664173 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-477x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1606" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-477x598.jpg 477w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-918x1152.jpg 918w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-1224x1536.jpg 1224w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-1632x2048.jpg 1632w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-191x240.jpg 191w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-383x480.jpg 383w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty-478x600.jpg 478w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lupita-Nyongo.-Photo-Getty.jpg 1870w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Deep, dark skin tones: For these skin tones, opt for red lipsticks with a maroon and blue base for a much more suited finish.
