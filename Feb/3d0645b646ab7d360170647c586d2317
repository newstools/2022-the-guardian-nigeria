The new Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Rhoda Gumus, has denied being a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC). She has, through her legal firm, Adams Fasingha & Co., given 14 days to the Convener of Concern Nigeria, Mr. Deji Adeyanju, Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazette to retract the allegation and apologise to her or face a legal action. Her counsel, in a letter dated February 9th and addressed to Adeyanju, said Gumus, a professor of Chemical Engineering, remained non-partisan and never belonged to any political party, including the APC.
