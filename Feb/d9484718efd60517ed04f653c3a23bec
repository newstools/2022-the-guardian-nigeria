Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM), yesterday, called on Nigerian citizens living in Ukraine to remain calm, amid growing fears that Russia could invade Ukraine. Media, Public Relations and Protocol Officer at NiDCOM, Mr. Gabriel Odu, made this known in a statement. The statement said Chairman/CEO of NiDCOM, Mrs. Abike Dabiri-Erewa, had earlier urged Nigerians in Ukraine to be calm and security conscious in view of the strained relations between Ukraine and Russia. It reads in part: “Dabiri-Erewa has assured that the Nigerian Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine, is doing all it can to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians in that country. “The NiDCOM boss also urged Nigerian citizens in Ukraine to visit the embassy’s website and duly follow the registration processes. “A statement from the Nigerian Embassy in Kiev has further provided information and necessary action with regards to emergencies and concerns.” Meanwhile, United States President, Joe Biden, has announced an increase of U.S. troops in Europe to strengthen North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s (NATO) eastern flank, as a response to the build-up of Russian troops near the Ukrainian border. A total of 1,700 troops will be redeployed from the U.S. to Poland, while a further 300 troops are to be sent to Germany. In turn, some 1,000 U.S. troops currently stationed in Germany will be redeployed to Romania, which shares a border with Ukraine.
