Some aggrieved members of the Anambra State chapter of the Nigeria Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASMEs) have faulted the election, which purportedly produced Chinemerem Oguegbe as its chairman. They claimed that there was no election and as such, Oguegbe could not have been elected as Chairman of the Anambra State chapter. One of the aggrieved candidates, Eucharia Adukwulu, yesterday, alleged that the South East Forum announced Oguegbe as Chairman, but rejected the outcome. “On February 10, 2022, Anambra Chapter of NASME gathered for a meeting and election in Awka and thereafter, the outgoing Chairman dissolved the executive and appointed Amaechi Okeke as returning Officer. “The contestants included former Vice President, Felix Odumegwu and the Financial Secretary, Eucharia Adukwulu. The three contestants agreed to conduct the election on February 12, but surprisingly by 7:00p.m., it was announced in NASME platform that Oguegbe emerged as Chairman. The development is fraudulent and should be checkmated,” she told The Guardian. She said neither Oguegbe nor his representative showed up at a reconciliation meeting on February 12, while the other contestants were duly represented, adding they formed a three-man interim government and communicated their decision to the national body. She added: “So, anybody dealing with Oguegbe as chairman of the state chapter does so at his or her own risk.”
