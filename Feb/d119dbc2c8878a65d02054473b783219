Virtually all students around the world had their schooling year disrupted due to COVID-19, resulting in little to no face-to-face instruction, which is key in the formative years. In the shadow of the pandemic, while some students in Nigeria were unable to attend school in any form, others had to quickly adapt to the new reality of online learning and in some cases through traditional media, radio and TV. Assisted by the teaching community, they submitted assignments on time, met attendance targets, problem solved and ensured parent and teacher satisfaction. 
 
In many ways, these students are the first generation of workforce in decades that found its way out of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic without any formal training in managing projects. The pandemic which felt like a temporary inconvenience is a stark reality we will confront daily in how we live, work and play. Its biggest and irreversible impact has been on the world of work. Change is inevitable, thanks to the many technological advancements in recent times. However, its arrival was certainly accelerated, and under the spectre of the pandemic, it was a landslide. 
 
The kind of careers that Nigeria’s Class of 2021 may have envisioned, has shifted due to the pandemic. The companies on their wish list are already reconfiguring to find new ways to stay relevant and deliver new products and services. These radical shifts simply mean two things, the career you choose today needs to keep up with the changes of tomorrow, and professionals, including the youth, need to learn new skills to keep up as well.
