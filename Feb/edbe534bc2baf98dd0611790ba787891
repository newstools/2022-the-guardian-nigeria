The Lagos State House of Assembly has tasked Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure the completion of the state’s rail project to ease the pains of transporters. Speaker of the House, who spoke yesterday at the plenary session, also commended the governor for expanding the transportation system through the waterways. He said that the completion of the project would ensure a substantial reduction in gridlocks across the state. Obasa, who presided over the sitting, said the governor deserved commendation just as he expressed optimism that the rail project would be completed by the administration. “The governor, therefore, deserves commendation,” the Speaker said while further noting the importance of the Opebi-Ojota Bridge project that is to be embarked upon by the government. “This is what our people deserve and we are encouraging the governor to do more, particularly on this rail-line issue. “We have been on this matter since the Jakande era. We wish he (Governor Sanwo-Olu) becomes the ‘lucky boy’ that would see to the completion of the rail projects,” Obasa added. The lawmaker representing Eti-Osa Constituency II, Gbolahan Yishawu, while earlier presenting a report on the governor’s recent inspection of some trains in the United States (U.S.), urged the House to approve necessary funds for the government to complete the Blue and Red lines of the rail projects. Yishawu noted that on average, people in the state always spend up to five hours on the roads as a result of gridlocks, adding added that the completion of the Red Line would reduce the challenge. “It is only a responsible government that would ensure that such wasted hours are reduced to the nearest minimum,” he said.
