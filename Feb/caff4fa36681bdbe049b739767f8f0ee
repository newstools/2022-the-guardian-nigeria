On the days when you are not nervous or panicking about meeting up a deadline at work, you worry about catering to the needs of a family member. After performing all these activities, you face a sudden realisation; while you took care of things at work and home, you forgot to take care of an important person; yourself. Now, this is where self-care comes in. What is self-care? Simply put, it’s taking care of yourself. Self-care is when you make a deliberate effort into promoting your physical and emotional health. The importance of self-care in the life of a person cannot be overemphasized, because it’s a time when you finally relax, pushing aside those worries. Self-care opens room for self-discovery, which leads to achieving a more productive and positive lifestyle. In this article, we listed ten ways you can take care of yourself. Sleep Sounds cliché, but true. Scientific studies have proven that getting enough sleep helps expand the lifespan of a person. An adult is expected to sleep for at least seven-nine hours a day. Sleep not only gives your body the rest it needs, but it also helps to re-energise the brain and adds that beautiful glow to your skin. So, quit keeping late nights and depriving yourself of the golden opportunity to jump on a bed, close your eyes, and be transported to a beautiful dreamy world. Book Photo Pixabay Reading is fun. Through reading books and novels, you discover new facts and gain knowledge about things that would make your life easier. Reading also stimulates your brain, serves as a form of entertainment, and widens the scope of your imagination. Time to grab that purse or wallet and head straight to a bookstore to get that amazing book you saw a friend’s auntie’s mother-in-law read. Few of you might agree with us that sometimes working a 9-5 job could get a little toxic. While we enjoy working and earning salaries, it’s okay to take a break from it.

The truth is if something was to happen to you right now, over fifty people will be available to take your place. So, walk up to your human resources personnel and submit that leave request letter. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1631223 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Journaling.-Photo-Pinterest-895x598.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="598" /> Keeping a journal is important in your journey to self-care. Journals allow you to pour out your thoughts and feelings, write affirming and motivational notes to yourself, and allow you to create a roadmap to where you are headed in this maze called life. Therapists advise journal keeping because writing those problems helps you to confront them. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1190535 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456.jpg 800w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456-487x324.jpg 487w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456-640x426.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/healthy-food-background-fruits-vegetables-cereal-nuts-superfood-dietary-balanced-vegetarian-eating-products-kitchen-143677456-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Eating well should be like a five and six for everyone.

Doing this helps you appreciate yourself and the effort that goes into what you do. In every human’s life, having relationships with people is a must. Family and friends are needed, and you should surround yourself with them. Don’t be too busy with work to forget about them. Create time and hang out with them. These are the people who will always be there for you through the challenges you might face.
