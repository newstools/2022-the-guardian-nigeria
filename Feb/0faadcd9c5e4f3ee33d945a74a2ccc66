Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike has accused Raymond Dokpesi of being an All Progressives Congress (APC) mole in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The governor said that he is convinced that Dokpesi is working for the APC. “I have some suspicion that people like Raymond Dokpesi are not really sincere to the Peoples Democratic Party and I think, I’m convinced that Raymond Dokpesi appears to be working for APC,” Wike said. Wike, in a statement by his media aide Kelvin Ebiri, said PDP governors got text messages and calls that Dokpesi said they embarked on a weeklong trip to Europe to choose the president and vice president candidates of the party. He said it is not true that he led PDP governors to Europe to pick the party’s presidential and vice-presidential candidates. “I have always said to people in PDP, nobody should cause a division among the governors,” Wike said. “We are trying as much as we can to build the party back and see that in 2023 PDP takes over governance. “I don’t understand where Raymond Dokpesi gets this information, this rumour that governors travelled to Europe to decide who will be the presidential candidate and vice-presidential candidate of PDP. I wonder why governors will travel to Europe to make such a decision. Dokpesi is leading the nationwide consultation for the candidacy of former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar who is yet to declare his ambition to contest the PDP ticket. “I have told Raymond Dokpesi that there is nothing wrong with you preaching for the candidature of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the Waziri of Adamawa, a very experienced man, an intelligent man, a strategist. But don’t destroy other people because of this. Because when you destroy them it will be difficult for the PDP to win the election in 2023.” He, however, pledged to support whosoever wins the PDP presidential ticket even if it is Atiku.
