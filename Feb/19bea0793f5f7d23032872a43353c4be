They cried like babies after losing the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations title to the Teranga Lions of Senegal. But for the Pharaohs of Egypt, a pay back time awaits Sadio Mane and his Senegalese team soon.
   
The Mohamed Salah-led Pharaohs will get a chance to bounce back from their defeat when they play Senegal again in a Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifying play-off next month. The decisive World Cup play-off is a two-legged affair.
 
The Pharaohs came into Sunday’s final at Olembe Stadium hoping to extend their AFCON title to eight, having grabbed seven continental crowns in the past. But they went down 4-2 in a shoot-out in Yaounde after the match finished 0-0 at the end of extra time.
 
Mohamed Abdelmonem and Mohanad Lasheen failed to convert their penalties, meaning Salah did not get the chance to step up before Sadio Mane converted the winning kick for Senegal to give the Teranga Lions their first ever AFCON crown.  On his part, Mendy had the easier night of the two ‘keepers but made a fine save at his near post to deny a whipped effort from Salah in the first half. The Chelsea goalkeeper maintained his composure in the final seconds of extra time to push a powerful effort from Marwan Hamdi over the bar and take the game to penalties, where he came into his own, saving Mohanad Lasheen’s poor spot kick after Mohamed Abdelmonem struck the inside post to hand Mane the chance to atone for his earlier miss by converting the winning penalty.
 
Will Sadio Mane and the Senegalese squad break Egypt’s heart a second time, when they meet for Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier next month? Or will they allow Mo Salah and the Pharaohs have their way? The countdown has begun.
