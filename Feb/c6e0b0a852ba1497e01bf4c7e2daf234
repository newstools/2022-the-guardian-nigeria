Three years since the issuance of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), a compliance solutions company, DataPro Limited has commended the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) for ensuring that Nigeria continues to improve on data protection and privacy.
   
Team Lead, Data Protection and Privacy Compliance Department of DataPro Limited, Ademikun Adeseyoju, said the agency has not reneged on the performance of its oversight function as it has continued to improve, resulting in significant compliance by entities.
 
She said this was evident in its effort to hold entities accountable.
 
According to her, between 2020 and 2021, NITDA received audit fillings from 1230 entities, a 94 per cent growth from 2019/2020 filings.
 
Similarly, in its commitment to the creation of job opportunities, 42 additional entities were granted Data Protection Compliance Organisation (DPCO) license in 2021, bringing the total number of DPCOs to 102, of which DataPro is one.
