There is something about music that bonds people on a deeper level. Regardless of what your plans are, romantic songs will always compliment them: Search for all-time classics, poetic options or even modern tunes. These songs can be played in the background while you are affirming your love for your loved one. The most important is to play the songs your significant other loves. Here are some options you can choose from: One Naira by M.I: In the song, Mr. Incredible, one of Nigeria’s greatest rappers, writes about a girl he dated and really loved. He reminisced about how dating was easy and his now-late lover did not care about his financial status. Waje, whom he featured, got her inspiration from her mother, who would do anything for her. Falling in love with you by Elvis Presley: This classic talks about how a man fell in love with a woman he had just met and he feels she is the one he would love to spend the rest of his life with. Ololufe by Wande Coal: Ololufe, described as one of the greatest love songs by a Nigerian, was released in 2007. This song talks about a man’s love for a woman and how he can go the extra mile to prove it. Perfect by Ed Sheeran: This song was written about Ed Sheeran’s then-girlfriend, now wife. He revealed that the inspiration for the lyrics came after listening to Future’s “March Madness” in James Blunt’s house. He booked a studio session that day, sang the song and knew that “It was special.” The lyrics, “Barefoot on the grass, dancing to our favourite song” was coined out of “March Madness” by future. All of me by John Legend: This beautiful song was written by John Legend, who had his inspiration from his love for his then-fiancée, now wife, Chrissy Teigen. “This song is saying things that balance each other out. At the same time as you are giving everything up, you are gaining everything and that is what the whole song is about. If you are in love and you connect, then even when you are giving things up, you are gaining so much from it,” he told Fuse Tv. Iyawo Mi by Timi Dakolo: Timi Dakolo, who never fails to express his love for his wife, got inspired by his love and that birthed the song, Iyawo Mi. The song explains the good and difficult sides of marriage that couples face and how their love conquers all. Oruka by Sunny Neji: The Legendary Sunny Neji revealed during an interview that there was no song for him to dance to on his wedding day. The thought of having a wedding song started building in his head and he wrote the song.
