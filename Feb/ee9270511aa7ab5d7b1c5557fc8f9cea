One person was feared killed and many confirmed injured on Saturday when armed thugs attacked the Soka residence of Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo aka Sunday Igboho, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. This is coming 48 hours after the Agbekoya threatened the Benin Republic to release the Yoruba nation activist. Igboho’s lead lawyer, Yomi Aliyyu (SAN), confirmed the attack to journalists. Aliyu said the armed thugs stormed Igboho’s residence and macheted the associates of the Yoruba Nation campaigner, leaving one of his aides dead. He said: “His Soka residence was attacked today by thugs and one person was marched to death, while some of Igboho’s men tried to prevent them from entering. Scores of the boys that tried to resist them were seriously injured.” “But I won’t be able to say more than this. You will be briefed further as events unfold.” He said the hoodlums attacked the same house of the agitator that the Department of State Services attacked on July 1, 2021. Efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Public Relations Officer, Adewale Osifeso, proved abortive. The Department of State Service had stormed Igboho’s Ibadan residence in a Gestapo style around 2am on July 1, 2021. The secret police killed two of the agitator’s associates and arrested 12 others who were released months later. He was declared wanted by the secret police for allegedly stockpiling arms to destabilise Nigeria, an allegation he denied, Igboho escaped to the neighbouring francophone country in July 2021. He had since been remanded in a prison in the Benin Republic for over six months where he is said to be facing trial for immigration-related offences, amongst others.
