Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Tuesday, presented details of 24 properties worth N10.9 billion forfeited to the Federal Government by a top military officer. The commission, however, did not give the name of the officer. Justice N.E. Maha of the Federal High Court, Abuja, had, on Monday, ordered the final forfeiture of the properties held by fronts and proxies to the top officer.
