Kano State Hisbah Board says it will sanction anyone found guilty of child labour and molestation. Commander-General of the board, Dr Harun Ibn-Sina, gave the warning in a statement issued after apprehending some underage children being engaged in street begging, on Monday in Kano. He said that some of those evacuated from the streets were from neighbouring states employed as house helps, while others claimed to have fled from their almajiri school. “The rate at which under-age children engage in societal vices is very alarming,” Ibn-Sina said. While describing children as leaders of tomorrow, he stressed the need for parents and guardians to take full responsibility and maintain a crime-free society. The commander-general said that Hisbah would intensify more efforts toward mitigating the menace of street begging, child labour and molestation, among others. It also stated that the state government had submitted a draft Child Protection Bill to the House of Assembly, adding that if passed into law, it would protect the interest of children against all forms of oppression. He further explained that the board had commenced the process of reuniting those evacuated from the street with their respective families. “All those found guilty of negligence and molestation of underage children will be sanctioned immediately. “Philanthropists and wealthy individuals should assist the orphans and the less-privileged in the society to mitigate street begging and child labour,” he said. Ibn-Sina also reaffirmed the board’s readiness to partner with parents, religious leaders, traditional rulers and all relevant stakeholders in curtailing societal vices and protecting children’s rights.
