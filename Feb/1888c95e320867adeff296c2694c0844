Condemn secret trial of Yoruba nation activist
The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has described the continued detention of Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a. Sunday Igboho) without trial as misplacement of justice. Adams, in a statement by his Media Aide, Kehinde Aderemi, accused the Benin Republic court of lacking respect for human rights. The Aare Ona Kakanfo, who applauded the efforts of Igboho’s counsel, Chief Yomi Aliyu (SAN), for seeking redress from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court, decried the manner with which the Republic of Benin government was handling Igboho’s case. He added that with Igboho’s continued detention, it was evident that his rights had been violated by the court. “His prolonged detention has shown that the laws of Benin Republic are no respecter of human rights. “There was misplacement of justice in the way Igboho’s detention was extended without trial. It is evident that Benin Republic has taken Igboho’s case far beyond the normal legal procedures,” he said. Adams, while urging Yoruba in the Diaspora to present Igboho’s case to the global communities, said efforts should be made to seek redress from the African Union (AU) Court or International Court of Justice (ICJ).” MEANWHILE, President, Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum, Akin Malaolu, has appealed to Benin Republic government to consider the state of health of the Yoruba agitator, saying that while it is true that no medical doctor has furnished the world the status of Igboho’s health, it is normal to think that he must have been undergoing health issues having been detained for more than six months. He said the Benin Republic Court should reconsider its judgment to determine whether it has the right to further detain Igboho for another six months.
