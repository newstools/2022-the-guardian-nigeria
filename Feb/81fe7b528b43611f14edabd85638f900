The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), yesterday, confirmed that it has received an in-depth technical report on the Super Eagles’ outing at the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations finals in Cameroun from the team’s technical crew, led by Augustine Eguavoen. “We have received the technical report on the AFCON 2021 and we are currently studying it, in conjunction with the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development. Once the study and appraisal are done with, we will make known our position,” NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi said. Nigeria won all her three group phase matches against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau in Garoua, and emerged the only team in the tournament to log maximum nine points from three matches. The team, however, lost by the odd goal to Tunisia in the Round of 16. The Super Eagles will take on Ghana’s Black Stars in the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off round scheduled for the month of March.
