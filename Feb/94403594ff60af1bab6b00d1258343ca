From hilarious auditions to emotional stories and discovering the gems in the rough of thousands of auditioners, the season so far has been delightful. It gets even better when you throw in the combination of judges and guest judges into the mix. D’banj is always on hand to make even the worst performers feel good about themselves. Simi will tell you upfront if she likes your tone, but that never really means she’ll vote ‘yes.’ Obi Asika, on the other hand, will say it like it is. Together with the performers this far, all three judges have shown that we are in for a brilliant new season of Nigerian Idol. The only thing that may make it difficult for anyone to enjoy the show is finding the time to catch it live. However, with the Showmax app, there’s an easy solution – watch it on the go, wherever you are. The show is streamed live on Showmax at 7 pm every Sunday, but new episodes remain on the platform so that fans can watch it anytime they want.
