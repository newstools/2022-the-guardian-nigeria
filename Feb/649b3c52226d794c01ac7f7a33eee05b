Upon privatisation, government had created the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) to provide electricity in rural communities with the support of Rural Electrification Fund (REF). Abdulazeez Musa Yar’Adua, a family member of the late President Umar Musa Yar’Adua, now chairs the board of the agency. Managing Director/CEO of REA, Ahmad Salihijo Ahmad, remains a board member, while Sanusi Ohiare was re-appointed to manage REF. Other members of the board, representing the six geopolitical zones, are: Michael Oluwagbemi (South West), Chidi Emmanuel Nwogu (South East), Catherine Ajibike (South South), Dr. Abdullahi Garba (North West), Dr. Abdul Umar (North East) and Mohammed Kabir Badamasuiy (North Central). Also represented on the governing board, with ex-officio capacity, are Federal Ministry of Power (supervising ministry), Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning as well as the Bureau for Public Enterprise (BPE). Minister of State for Power, Godwin Jedy Agba, while inaugurating the board, said the move would strengthen the resolve of the current administration to provide electricity for the masses.
