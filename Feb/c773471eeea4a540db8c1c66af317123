The Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN), in collaboration with the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), has organised a training workshop for cocoa farmers on best agricultural practices and the use of pesticides on cocoa. According to the organisations, the training is in line with the efforts of the Federal Government to diversify non-oil exports, develop better production of cocoa and its export. No fewer than 100 cocoa farmers attended the one-day training held at CFAN building in Osogbo. Speaking, one of the resource persons, a plant breeder from CRIN, Dr Festus Olasupo, said the farmers were taught latest techniques that would enhance the quality of cocoa beans they produce, adding that the farmers needed to be taught how they could give the best. Another trainer, a Director in CRIN, Dr. Rasheed Adedeji, said the training would enhance better appreciation of cocoa beans produced in Nigeria, both within and outside Nigeria. “Not only would this be a solution to food shortage in the country, but it would also be a viable alternative to crude oil,” Adedeji said. Mr. Benson Oseni, Trade Promotion Advisor for NEPC, Osogbo, who represented the Executive Director, Dr. Ezra Yukusak, said the training would aid the production of standard products by the farmers. Speaking, Osun State Commissioner of Agriculture and Food Security, Hon Adewole Adedayo, said through the training, the dream of having a zero oil economy would be achieved. Represented at the training by Adegbite Adeniyi, the Director of Osun State Produce Services, Adedayo commended CRIN and NEPC for organising the workshop. The chairman of Cocoa Farmers Association of Nigeria in Osun State, Mr Raji Musa Akanni, commended the organisations for the training, saying: “It will go a long way to prevent cocoa farmers from wrong practices like sun-drying cocoa produce along the road and using wrong chemicals.”
