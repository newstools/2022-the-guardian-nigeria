Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has threatened to publish names of absentee members during the e-voting on the Constitution amendment on March 2 and 3, 2022. Gbajabiamila, who made this known at plenary, yesterday, urged the lawmakers to participate because of its significance to the country. His words: “Honourable members, we will be voting on the first set of Constitution amendment on March 3 and 4. It is important that all members are present on Wednesday and Thursday. We will publish the name of any member that is not present on that day.” He added that the constituents of such member would, at least, know that their representative was not present for the all-important Constitution review. According to the Speaker, no lawmaker will be permitted to embark on oversight or committee assignment on the two days set aside for the amendment, as every member is expected to be on the floor to cast their votes. Relatedly, wife of the President, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, was at the green chamber, yesterday, to show support for the womenfolk in the Constitution review. Majority Leader of the House, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, announced the first lady’s arrival and the need to admit her to the chamber. Gbajabiamila said the President’s wife came to lend her support for the women, adding that the lawmakers were not unmindful of the weight of her office to promote the welfare of women. The Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, said the presence of the first lady would influence a lot of things in favour of the women.
