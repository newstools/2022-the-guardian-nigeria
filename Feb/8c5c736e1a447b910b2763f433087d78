The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has reiterated its faith in the vision of the AfricaNEXT Conference (AfricaNXT) to “co-create a prosperous future for all Africans” through collaborations, conversations and programming that are oriented in harvesting, harnessing and leveraging innovative technologies.
  
“The visualisations and concrete actions of the AfricaNXT conference are in congruence with NCC’s faith in the promise of technology to galvanise Nigeria’s, nay Africa’s, development. This explains our continued support and participation at the Conference which is now in its 10th year, and we will continue to play active role in this event, which takes place in Lagos yearly.”
   
Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (EVC/CEO) of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, stated this during a chat with the Commission’s in-house media team last week, ahead of preparations by the Commission’s delegation to the confab, which will hold from February 27 to March 4, 2022.  Formerly known as Social Media Week Lagos, the AfricaNXT Conference is the largest assemblage of innovators from across Africa and Africa’s Diasporan communities. As a consistent programming partner of AfricaNXT, the NCC has been a regular feature of the conference and festival. At the AfricaNXT 2022, the NCC will take the discourse on 5G further in a more pragmatic context in view of the progress achieved over the past two years.
 
The thematic focus for its panel of discussants is, “Moving Forward Steadily, Timely and with Precision: The Socio-Economic Significance of Deployment of 5G Services”. Participants will have the opportunity to glean the benefits of 5G services to individuals, businesses, and the nation, with positive implications for the continent, as Nigeria matches steadily to become the first country in West Africa to deploy 5G technology services.
