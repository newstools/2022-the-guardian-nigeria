One of the sponsors of basketball in the country, Zenith Bank Plc, has hailed the performance of the national women team, D’Tigress, who recently qualified for the FIBA World Cup despite several adversities that affected the team. Speaking on the performance of the team, the bank, which has been sponsoring the women league for over 15 years, said it is a thing of joy for the team to secure qualification after overcoming the opening day loss to China before defeating France and Mali. According to the bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, the country continues to reap the reward of the company’s involvement in the development of basketball in Nigeria. Recall that the Most Valuable Player of the 2019 edition of the Zenith Bank Women’s Basketball league was Murjanatu Musa, who played for Air Warriors. She featured in the team that qualified the country for the World Cup. “We are so proud of the ticket won by the national basketball team and, particularly, we are impressed with the consistency of the girls too,” Onyeagwu said. “As the sponsors of the domestic league for over 15 years, we believe our investment in the sport has not been in vain, especially because many of the players were products of the league before they moved abroad. “We are inspired by this feat and so, we will double our commitment to the game to make Nigeria one of the best in the world. It’s a matter of time, D’Tigress will rule the world soon.”
