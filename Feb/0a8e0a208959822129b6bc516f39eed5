These Valentine day celebrations reflect local ideas about love. Let’s take a look at how some countries or climes celebrate their valentine’s day now, shall we? France It is believed that the first-ever Valentine’s Day card originated in France, when Charles, the Duke of Orleans, sent a love letter to his wife from the prison in 1415. This act led to the naming of a French village as “St. Valentin” in the Loire Valley, which later turned into the epicentre of romance between 12th and 14th February. With red roses to make even the hardest of hearts fall in love, one can easily see the beautiful yards and trees, share a kiss at the Love garden, and homes decorated with love cards, roses, and proposals for marriage flakes making it one of the most beautiful Valentine’s Day traditions in the world. Argentina Argentinians don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day in February. Rather, they celebrate what they call “the week of sweetness” in July. It is the day when lovers’ exchange kisses and receive chocolates and other sweets. The day started as a commercial invention but later became a Valentine tradition. The best places to visit for a romantic valentine dinner in Argentina are Puerto Madero, Rosedal, Iguaza Falls, Tierra del Feugo National Park, and Ushuaia. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1668694 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow-909x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="842" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow-909x598.jpg 909w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow-320x211.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow-640x421.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow-600x395.jpg 600w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/A-Valetine-themed-cupcake.-Photo-GoodtoKnow.jpg 1228w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> South Korea In South Korea, romantic couples celebrate the day of love on the 14th of each month. “The day of roses” is celebrated in May, “the day of kisses” is celebrated in June, “the day of hugs in December” and single people celebrate “the black day” in April by eating black noodles.
