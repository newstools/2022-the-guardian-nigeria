The Managing Director, LAGFERRY, Abdoulbaq Balogun, yesterday, expressed optimism that the Governor Babajide Olushola Sanwo-Olu-led administration would soon increase the number of boats and construct more terminals to open up other parts of the state to water transportation. Balogun stated this while reviewing what transpired during the LAGFERRY yearly Valentine event held in conjunction with the Ladies of Your TVC show. In a statement, he said that it was an afternoon of fun, games, karaoke and more as couples, guests and revellers celebrated on LAGFERRY’s 180 tonnage barge, which was well decorated in red to reflect the colour of love. The barge, which had over 120 people on board, sailed from the Five Cowries Terminal Falomo-Ikoyi, through Civic Tower, Lekki Adax Jetty, the popular Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge, Banana Island, Third Mainland Bridge and back at Five Cowries Terminal, Falomo-Ikoyi, while guests savoured the ambiance of the Lagos coastline. He expressed excitement and satisfaction with this year’s Valentine event, assuring that the agency will continue to partner with tourism firms and entertainment managers to showcase the tourism potentials of the state. “We are committed to continue this tradition and more as it relates to one of the pillars, ‘Entertainment and Tourism’ of the administration’s T.H.E.M.E.S agenda. Our barge MV Adimu Orisa is readily available for charter and as you can see today, all events like weddings, birthdays, shows, among other events, can be held on it, while it cruises through the Lagos waterways,” he stated.
