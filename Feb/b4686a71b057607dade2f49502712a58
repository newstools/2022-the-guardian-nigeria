Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) hosts, Cameroun will hope to end their tournament on a high when taking on Burkina Faso for the bronze medal today. A gruelling penalty shootout defeat against seven-time champions, Egypt ended their hopes of a title on home soil and they will be back in action just 48 hours later in Yaounde. That is because CAF moved this game forward a day, having originally scheduled it for tomorrow afternoon. Burkina Faso’s wait for an AFCON crown goes on after losing to Senegal in the semis, but they can replicate their third-place finish in 2017 by defeating Cameroun. Several changes are expected for both teams, particularly with Cameroun playing only 48 hours after their semi-final that went the distance against Egypt. Young goalkeeper, Simon Omossola could step in for the Lions while Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting and Pierre Kunde will hope to come into the XI, having not been involved in the Egypt defeat. Vincent Aboubakar could remain in the attack to bolster his top scorer credentials. Cameroun will either be tired or resting key players for this game, but the laborious pace of most third-place play-offs should mitigate those problems for the hosts.
