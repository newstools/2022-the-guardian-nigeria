Manchester United said Friday they had “withdrawn” sponsorship rights from Russia’s flagship carrier Aeroflot after President Vladimir Putin unleashed a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The British government on Thursday imposed a biting package of sanctions on Moscow, which included banning the airline from UK airspace. Moscow subsequently banned all UK-linked planes, including transiting flights, from its airspace. “In light of events in Ukraine, we have withdrawn Aeroflot’s sponsorship rights,” United said in a statement. “We share the concerns of our fans around the world and extend our sympathies to those affected.” Manchester United announced Aeroflot as its “official carrier” in 2013.
