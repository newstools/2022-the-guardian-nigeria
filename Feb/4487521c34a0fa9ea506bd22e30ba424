One of Croatia’s key ministers was sacked on Saturday following his arrest as part of a corruption probe, in a serious blow to the  conservative government. Construction minister Darko Horvat is suspected of authorising “unfounded payment” of more than 350,000 euros ($400,554) in subsidies in 2018, when he was acting minister of economy, the national anti-corruption USKOK bureau said in a statement. Hours after his arrest, Croatian government said the 51-year-old had been dismissed. “Prime minister Andrej Plenkovic dismissed Darko Horvat from his duty of minister of construction, planning and state property,” a government statement said. However, the prime minister initially questioned the prosecutors’ conduct, alleging that the timing of the move was “not neutral” and demanded an explanation over “dramatic urgency” with which the arrest was made. “This move seems disproportionate to me, considering the case in question,” Plenkovic told a televised news conference. The investigation might have even bigger political consequences, since it also targets deputy prime minister Boris Milosevic and several former and current officials, according to Hina news agency. Plenkovic underlined that parliamentary majority is stable and rejected the idea of a snap election. Horvat faced strong criticism from the opposition and the media over a slow recovery from two earthquakes in 2020 and 2021. The ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party has been accused of systemic corruption. In November, a former minister was arrested under suspicion of fraud related to allocation of European Union funds. The fight against corruption was key to Croatia’s successful bid to join the EU in 2013.
