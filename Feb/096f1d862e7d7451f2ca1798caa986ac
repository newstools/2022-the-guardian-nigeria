Sir: The expectation of any graduate after school is to secure a well-paying job after the conclusion of his studies but the reality in Nigeria labour sector has proven otherwise as there is no meaningful job anywhere after the mandatory National Youth Services Corps (NYSC) programme. But back in the early 70s, the exercise differed as fresh university and polytechnic graduates, even graduates of teachers colleges, had jobs waiting for them ranging from clerical to professional jobs based on their areas of specialisation.
 
Despite the fact that the country had all this kind of system of government before then, what changed the fate of the Nigeria graduate and how does it link up to the present issues and challenges faced by the government, especially in the area of insecurity?  The system of the country has broken down; as there is no sector that is well-performing that can absorb or reduce the rate of unemployment and this results in a high level of poverty which makes so many youths engage in criminal activities.
 
There are other causative factors for the high unemployment rate in Nigeria, which has been posing a big threat to the huge population. One of these is corruption, another challenge, as favouritism and nepotism became key requirements for job placement and replacement in both the private and public sectors. Today jobs are not being given based on merit and these have denied well qualified Nigerians the opportunity to be employed in any sector in the country.
