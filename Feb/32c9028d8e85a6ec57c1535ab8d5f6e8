Nigerian flag carrier, Air Peace, has disclosed plans to resume direct scheduled flights on Lagos- Dubai route starting from March 1. This is as the airline is also set to expand its West Coast presence by launching flight operations into Niamey and Niger on February 25, 2022, as well as Kinshasha and Malabo in March. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, said the Lagos-Dubai-Lagos flights will operate three weekly flights from its Lagos hub. Olisa said: “We are happy to inform the flying public that in tandem with our commitment to providing more flight connectivity and meeting the air travel needs of Nigerians, we are restarting our United Arab Emirates (UAE) operations, but with Dubai as the destination, and not Sharjah. We abundantly appreciate the vital role played by the Nigerian Government in making this possible.” The airline stated that before Q1 runs out, “we shall commence scheduled flights to Kinshasha in DR Congo and Malabo in Equatorial Guinea, to enlarge our footprints in West Africa and offer the flying public more network options,” adding that Niamey flights will operate from Abuja and Kano on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays with the Hopper jets. Air Peace has been operating scheduled commercial flights into the UAE since July, 2019, with a plan to scale up its service delivery to surpass the expectations of air travellers, especially with the activation of its ambitious fleet modernisation scheme and a renewed commitment to unequalled customer experience. Air Peace has also been designated by the Federal Government to fly into other international destinations such as Guangzhou-China, Delhi-India, UK and Houston-US. Air Peace leads the industry with 20 domestic routes, six regional routes and two international destinations while it operates an increasing modern fleet of 34 aircraft, including five brand new E195-E2s and 5 Airbus 320s.
