Analysts at Codros Capital said: “In the coming weeks, we expect the NGX floor to be flooded with corporate earnings as more companies publish their audited 2021FY numbers, accompanied by dividend declarations. “We believe this would provide a catalyst for buying activities even as risk-averse investors are likely to remain cautious due to medium-term expectations of an uptick in FI yields. “Overall, we advise investors to seek trading opportunities in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Next week, we foresee a lukewarm start to trading, as investors continue to digest the latest economic data while cherry-picking attractive counters. We also anticipate some profit-taking activity on some of this week’s gainers.”
