The leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafran (IPOB( Nnamdi Kanu on Wednesday on Wednesday told the court that he was going blind and pleaded with the judge to rescue him. Kanu said since his re-arrest, he had not been allowed to take reading glasses provided by his family. The IPOB who spoke through his lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome SAN, informed Justice Binta Nyako that his glasses were brought to Kenya where he was arrested were damaged by security agents during his arrest. The defendant further claimed that the glasses he brought to Nigeria in 2015 when he was first arrested were seized by DSS and have not been released to him. Kanu also complained that he had not been allowed to take clothes from his family, hence, he has been wearing same cloth since his re-arrest in June last year. At the time of this report, Kanu is asking the court to dismiss the charges against him on the ground that the alleged offences were not committed in Nigeria. He also claimed that no prima facie has been made against him by the federal government throughout the proof of evidence in support of the charges.
