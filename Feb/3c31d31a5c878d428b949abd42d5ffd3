A member of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Technical Committee, Dahiru Sadi, has advised home-based players to seek ways of developing themselves to  for the Super Eagles. Dahiru told The Guardian, at the weekend, that he recently left the venue of a Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL) unhappy because of the abysmal football on display. “What I saw was a nonsense football; not the kind of game I would love to watch because at the end of the day, I was displeased with how it ended. “My conclusion was that if either of the two teams ended up qualifying for any of the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) competitions, they would be bundled out in the first round. In the match, I didn’t see any tactical display from the two teams. What I saw were two teams struggling… it was as if they were fighting. “In watching a game, at least you expect to see tactical play from the teams, emanating from the instructions passed to the players by the teams’ coaches, and then you know that you are watching a league game,” he said. The former Eagles midfielder advised players in the NPFL to work hard to improve their game and not depending solely on their coaches’ inputs. “If we don’t develop the league here, I don’t think we are going anywhere. Go to Kenya and see for yourself what is happening there with their league. Even when you see their league on television, you still enjoy it. “If some of our players in the league can still play good football despite the myriad of problems they are being overwhelmed with, then it means that we have potential, who when exposed, can match Europe-based players invited to play for the country,” he stated.
