Photo/ RockciryFM  Some individuals are born musicians and they work tirelessly to sharpen their art keeping their talent as sharp and as fresh as can be. The fact that music makes people lose control is perhaps, one of the reasons why people who have carved a niche in other industries decide to branch out to become musicians with the assumption that music is like singing in the bathroom. “Music-making one lose control” has been reflected in various Nigerian actors and actresses branching out to try music and not necessarily thriving in it. They wither and they fall, here is a list of Nigerian film stars who have tasted the music scene. Genevieve Nnaji The actress with her girl next door aura ventured into music in 2005 with a single titled No More. The actress uses her song to confront societal issues like battery in relationships. The release caused a series of backlash and no one has heard musically again from the black skin girl. The one-time lover boy also walked the path of music and made a great fall. The 2009 hyped single Who Am I features renowned musician Tuface but that didn’t stop the inevitable from talking place. Nkem Owoh The award-winning popular actor is known for his comedic roles in The Nigerian industry. His song I Go Chop Your Dollar is a song that more or less promotes fraud, and was used as the theme song in the film The Master. For content reason ,the song was ban by NBC.  The actor has more songs that were prompted by some of the films he featured in. Omotola Jalade Ekeinde The actress, who with bravery, came back twice to the music scene with ‘Gba’ and  ‘Missing You’.  Omo sexy as she is fondly called even promised a collaboration with Akon. We await.
