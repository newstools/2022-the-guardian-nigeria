 Tyga Photo Pinterest American rapper Tyga will not be charged with a felony following the domestic violence allegations made by his ex Camryn Swanson. Back in October, Tyga was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence after Swanson alleged that he had hit her when they got in an argument at the rapper’s home. He turned himself in to the police, and his bail was set at $50k. TMZ reports that the police had passed the rapper’s DV case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to decide if they wanted to file charges against Tyga. The LA County DA has moved the case to the Los Angeles City Attorney’s Office, which means the rapper would not be charged with a felony as only the DA’s Office can charge folks with a felony. The rapper, who won’t be charged as long as he stays out of trouble, will be meeting with police officers to talk about how to handle domestic disputes in the future better. Tyga will now sit down with prosecutors to discuss how to handle domestic disputes in the future better. Also, the rapper is expected to legally keep his nose clean for the next year or risk being charged with a misdemeanour in the case. This DV case has, however, not prevented the exes from hanging out, as TMZ reports that they have begun hanging out again.
