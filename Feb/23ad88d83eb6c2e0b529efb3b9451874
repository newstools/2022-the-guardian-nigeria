However, market sentiment was positive as 26 stocks appreciated in price while 16 constituted the losers chart. Analysts at Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said, “Despite the recovery seen in the insurance sector (+91bps) and the marginal gain in the oil and gas space (+3bps), the domestic bourse closed south due to decline in the banking (-35bps) and consumer goods (-588bps) sector. “We expect this bearish sentiment to filter into tomorrow’s trading session, amid bargain hunting in some counters spurred by cheap valuations, and continued sell offs in other counters.
