He claims that the Netflix documentary, “Tinder Swindler” showed a false representation of him and he wants to clear his name. That is not all, he intends to write a book, star on a dating show (isn’t that what he is good at after all), and host a dating podcast.

With his famed status as a swindler courtesy of the documentary, it appears all too fitting and shows he is ready to cash off this. In Tinder Swindler, he cajoles women with his lavish spending as the son of the “King of Diamonds” Lev Leviev and convinces them to “loan” his money before moving on to his next victim. Before his arrest in 2009, he had gotten victims to loan him $10 million.
