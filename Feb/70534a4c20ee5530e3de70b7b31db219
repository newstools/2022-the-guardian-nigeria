Five children have been abducted from their homes at Eliozu axis in Obio/Akpor Local Council of Rivers State. The Guardian gathered that the kids were abducted from two different families. Three of the kids were said to have gone over to their neighbours house to play when the incident happened. The children, who are aged between 18 months and four years, were said to be playing in the house when a yet-to-be-identified woman disguised as a lesson teacher looking for an apartment to rent came to the compound. Mother to the three kids Mrs Rose Monday, who confirmed the incident, said, her children were last seen after the suspected kidnapper took them to buy notebooks. Mrs Monday said, “ As I came back and I didn’t see my children but after sometimes, one came back home and I asked him  about the others, he said, the woman took them to oil mill market and gave him transport fare with another to return that she will bring them later” The devastated mother disclosed that the woman took seven children she carried and after, she paid transport for two lamenting that since then, they have not seen the woman and the children. Mother of the other two abducted children, Mrs. Blessing who also confirmed the incident, said the alleged kidnapper had hired her husband to purchase building materials for her, in a bid to distract him before going away with the children. The parents of the kids have cried to security agencies, the state government and relevant authorities to help rescue their children and arrest the woman kidnapper.
