The Association of Tourist Boat Operators and Water Transporters of Nigeria (ATBOWATON) has threatened to expel operators who consistently ignore distress calls from their colleagues. To also check the unhealthy breakdown of boat operation ethics, the National President, Dr. Ganiyu Balogun, said violators of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) save our soul distress call from any boat in trouble, would face serious sanctions, including expulsion from the association. This is even as the National President, Dr. Ganiyu Balogun, appointed two special advisers, Tope Fajemirokun and Joseph Philip, to help deepen the running of the private sector boat operator regulatory body. While Fajemirokun who is also the Badagry Chapter chairman of the association, takes up additional responsibility as special adviser to the National President on inter-government relationship and labour matters, Philip will process all national security issues on waterways, advise and guide the National President. Rising from a meeting with the Board of Trustees in Badagry over the weekend, the president disclosed that he needed the help of the two new appointees to chart new areas of ATBOWATON national operations to serve members well and to also enthrone democratic engagements expected of a national body. He called on the appointees to bring their wealth of experience and passion for the industry to bear on their new assignments, adding that ATBOWATON has come of age and must be seen to add value to the development of the system.
