Edo State Governor’s Wife, Betsy Obaseki, has promised participants in this year’s women invitational championship a better and bigger event this year. The Betsy Obaseki Women Championship debuted last year with teams from across the country contesting for honours at the new Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin. Speaking on the 2022 edition of the competition in Benin, on Tuesday, while unveiling Edo Queens’ 2022 jerseys, Obaseki said she would continue to look out for welfare of the girl/child, including creating avenues for them to actualise their potential. She said: “We had the maiden edition of Betsy Obaseki Women Championship last year and it was a great success.  We are preparing for the second edition as it is a yearly tournament, which will stay even beyond us because it is for the good and wellbeing of Edo women and girls. “So long as Edo mothers continue to give birth to girls, so long will the tournament exist. This year promises a bigger and more entertaining edition. “However, we are open to support in every form, not just cash.” Obaseki acknowledged the difficulties her pet team, Edo Queens, faced in the last edition of the competition and promised that fans of the club will see a better-equipped team this term. “Last year, the best we could get was the third position because we had such strong teams as Bayelsa Queens and Rivers Angels. This year, they are better prepared for these teams. “I promised the girls N1 million if they performed excellently and today I am going to hand over that money.” One of the things to expect from Edo Queens this year is smarter outfit following the unveiling of new jerseys for the team. Obaseki called on Edo Queens’ fans to support the club by buying their replica jerseys and other merchandise. This, she added, will help the Edo State government in its bid to position the club as the most modern women football side in the country.
