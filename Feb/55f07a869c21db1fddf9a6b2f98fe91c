• Inflation decelerates slightly to 15.6 per cent
• ‘Data is a mockery of market reality’
• Food crisis not reflecting govt’s ‘investment’ in agric, says farmers’ association 
• NNPC imports 2.3b litres as queues persist nationwide The near-term inflation outlook appears increasingly unpredictable, as the petrol shortage crisis and the rising cost of diesel have added to other challenges driving up prices of essential commodities in the country.
   
Efforts to rein in fuel supply shock have failed, leading to endless queues at many retail outlets in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and other cities. The crisis has worsened gridlocks in the metropolis with thousands of commuters stranded at bus stops.  But there are fears that the direction of the inflationary trend could change significantly this month. 
    
Triggered by the shortage of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), the cost of transportation, a key driver of inflation, has doubled or tripled in different cities. Faced with the rising cost of diesel, which currently sells for about N450/per litre, and increasing insecurity on highways, haulage companies review their pricing on a regular basis, leading to consistent high urban food inflation.    
  
Long queues persist across the country as the black market price of petrol hovers around N500 per litre in Abuja and N350 in Lagos, while motorists spend hours in queues.
  
Amid prolonged crisis, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, yesterday, said 2.3 billion litres of additional PMS is being imported into the country to complement the existing one billion litres supply, as part of measures to address the scarcity.  Adetunji assured that the ongoing efforts would be sustained to restore normalcy and urged Nigerians to avoid panic buying.  Also, the President of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry Young Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), Fife Banks, said the figures did not add up or reflect market reality.
