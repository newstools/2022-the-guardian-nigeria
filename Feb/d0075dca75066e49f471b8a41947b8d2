Suddenly, you feel your appearance is awkward and you can’t seem to figure out why. Viola! Like a light bulb, it’s your sunshades that don’t suit your oval, round, square, diamond, heart, pear, or oblong face. There are up to seven face shapes, many sunshades and glasses’ frames that flatter different face types, accompanied by makeup and hairstyles. Do you know your face shape? If you do, thumbs up to you because it will make shopping for the right shades a lot easier to pick. If you don’t know your face shape, this can get confusing because you are in for a hassle while getting a fitting glass shade for you. This article is here to guide you to having a free hassle when shopping for the right glass shades. Beginning with some practical tips while standing in front of a mirror, push your hair to the back to get a clear outline of your face. After this is done, using lipstick or a marker, draw the outline of your face in the mirror. Now you have a blueprint that shows you the shape of your face. Another way to figure out your face shape is by measuring. This method will need you to take notes. With a measuring tape, measure your forehead width, then the width of the cheekbone and the jawlines and primarily the length of the face. Now, pay keen attention to your facial qualities. What is the widest part of your face? Again, with the acquired data, you then compare it with the other types of faces to know what category of face shapes you belong to. Are You Round Faced? These are a few tips to easily determine if you have a round face. For that illusionary look for a round face to seem thinner and lengthy,  angular, thin eyeglass frames will do the trick. Another option is a wide rectangular frame. Do You Have A Square Face? Unlike the round face, the square-faced shape has prominent features. To soften the strong nature of this face shape by creating a longer look and relaxing curves, attempt narrow frame styles, frames with additional width rather than depth, and thin ovals. Do You Have A Heart Face? Choosing frames that are wide at the bottom will reduce the obvious width at the top of the face. Top options for the heart-shaped face are shades with frames that are thin, light-coloured, rimless frames with a light and fresh appeal. Do You Have An Oval Face Shape? In the case of an oval face, the length is more than the width. A perfect shade for the oval-shaped face will retain the normal proportion of an oval face. Pick eyeglass frames that are broad or broader than the widest portion of your face. Frames with walnut shapes not excessively deep or thin are an extremely nice option. Do You Have A Diamond Shape Face? This shape face can be conflicting for even the owners of such face types because it resembles the heart shape face. In order to accentuate the eyes and relax the cheekbones, use frames that have embellishments or unique brow lines. Diamond-shaped faces paired with rimless eyeglasses, with perhaps an oval or cat-eye shape similarly is great for one of the rarest shapes of face. Do You Have A Pear Face? A pear face is also called a triangle face is the rarest face shape among others. To get the perfect frames for this face shape is to make it seem shorter and neutralised by going for frames that have more depth than width as a better choice. Frames with embellishing or varying temples also add width to the face. Do You Have An Oblong Face? Frames that are huge in colour and embellishment on the main half brow of the frame enhance width and accentuate the thin upper third of the face. Cat-eye patterns also look nice on a base-down triangle face shape.
