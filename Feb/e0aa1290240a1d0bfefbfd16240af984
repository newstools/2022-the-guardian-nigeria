Since the news filtered in that four under-20 boys were caught with the head of Sofiat Okeowo in Ogun State, the latest in the series of alleged money ritual killings, a number of commentaries had been pointing accusing fingers at African traditional practices. While it is true that the detestable act has its root in primordial settings, I think a blanket disavowal of the indigenous past is a convenient detour that shifts attention from understanding the problem at hand and distracts proactive measures to stem the savagery.  For instance, there is a phenomenon called aworo (i.e. customer appeal remote control) that is still believed to draw large patronage to a trader in the marketplace. Aje (wealth) or Aje-salu ga (an epithet of the god of wealth and luck) also has its place in the mythical ecosystem and is believed to answer those who can summon it.  Man is a force that can manipulate or be manipulated by higher forces, it is not difficult to see how human beings could sacrifice selves (i.e. organs) or others for sudden wealth purposes. And going that far poses the problem.
  
It is important to note that the same traditional practice expressly frowns at human sacrifices generally, especially in the greedy pursuit of wealth. For instance, Ifa literary corpus made it clear that: “A fi tipa-tipa lowo won kii kadun. A fi wara-wara l’owo bi Olokun won kii d’ola. A mo, ‘b’o pe, b’o ya un o l’owo’ iyen mbe l’aba ti n je esun-isu. Ojo esan o lo titi ni ko je k’oro o dun’ni…” (He that is anxious to get rich quick will die quickly. Those desperate to be as wealthy as the river goddess will not see tomorrow. But ‘sooner or later, I will be rich’ is in the hut eating roasted yam with contentment. No one should be flustered (by the prosperity of the wicked) because their day of reckoning will come…).
