The Court of Appeal, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), division dismissed the judgment of a lower court which upheld the parallel congresses of All Progressives Congress (APC) conducted by the G-7 faction of the party led by senator Ibrahim Shekarau. By the ruling of the appeal court, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has finally retained the supremacy to control the state structure of APC under the leadership of Prince Abdullahi Abbas. In the judgment delivered on Thursday, the appeal court insisted that the Federal high court, FCT division lacks the jurisdiction to sit on the APC ward and local government council congresses which recognised Haruna Ahmadu Danzago as party chairman. The appeal court thereby upheld the prayers of the appellants (Ganduje faction) to recognize the existing leadership of the party and discountenance of the lower court ruling. Details later.
