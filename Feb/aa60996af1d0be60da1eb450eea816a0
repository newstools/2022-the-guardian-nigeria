People Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain and Publisher of Ovation Magazine International, Chief Dele Momodu, weekend declared his resolve to join the presidential race. He vowed to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 general election just as he began consultations with members of his Ihievbe ancestral community in Edo State to solicit their blessings. Addressing newsmen in his country home in Ihievbe in Owan council during a special homecoming, 49 years after departing the community, he said the country needs indefatigable persons like himself with global recognition to make Nigeria great again. Momodu said he would run for the office of the President come 2023 to bring in new ideas to rescue the country from bad leadership. Momodu, who was received by highly placed indigenes of Ihievbe community, including a former senator, Yisa Braimoh, expressed confidence in his ability to lead the country, if given the opportunity. On his part, traditional Head of Ugba village in Ihievbe community, Pa. Rufus Aigbevbole, described Dele Momodu as a son they are well pleased with. “It is a thing of joy and will always remain in our memory for long to have you in our midst today, particularly when I am still alive as the village head of your immediate community of Ugba. I would have message of hope to deliver to your loving father (Oboh Momodu) and others when I eventually pass on to the great beyond to meet them there someday,” Aigbevbole said.
