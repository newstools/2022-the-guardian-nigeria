On Wednesday in the African technology scene, Nigeria’s Flutterwave became the highest valued African startup after raising $250 million, bringing the company valuation to $3 billion. This astonishing feat by a five-year-old Nigerian-founded company, was celebrated with a photo on the cover of yesterday’s The Guardian. The photo, however, was placed next to our cover story, which focused on a totally unrelated venture and sector. This is to clarify that there was absolutely no correlation between the story and the image depicting members of the young and vibrant Flutterwave team in their Nigeria office. Any association between both materials is unintended and hereby regretted.
