Israeli authorities have arrested five suspects following an attack claimed by the Islamic State group that killed two policemen, the police said on Monday. The officers were shot dead on Sunday in the northern Israeli city of Hadera as the Jewish state hosted a landmark meeting of top US and Arab diplomats. Five people were also wounded when the gunmen opened fire at the police and passers-by in Hadera attack — the second since Tuesday linked to the jihadist group. The police officers killed were identified as Shirel Aboukrat, a French-Israeli citizen, and Yazan Falah. They were both 18 years old. Their funerals were to be held later in the day. A security source said the two gunmen were Israeli Arabs from the northern Arab-populated town of Umm al-Fahm. Police said they were identified by Israeli intelligence as local IS operatives and killed by counterterrorism officers who happened to be nearby. Israeli police, in cooperation with the domestic Shin Bet security agency, carried out raids in the Umm al-Fahm. “Three suspects were arrested there early on Monday on suspicion of membership in a terrorist organisation were arrested,” a police statement said.
