Sir: Though Nigeria practices a democratic system of government, the 1999 Constitution disrupted an important characteristic of democracy by placing an age barrier by disqualifying persons below the ages of 40 and 30 from throwing their hats into the ring and vying for president, and membership for House of Representatives and Assembly, respectively.
  
This mainly accounts for the reason known faces keep resurfaced in successive elections since 1999, especially at the Federal level, portraying a system that is under siege by the actions, inactions and reactions of the ageing political drivers of this country in policymaking and implementation, which has, indubitably, led to the marginalisation and limited political participation of the youth.
  
However, on May 31, 2018, an historic event took place in Nigeria. The event was the signing of the Not Too Young To Run bill into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. The legislation brought down the age qualification for President from 40 to 30; from 30 to 25 for the House of Representatives and States’ House of Assembly. It, however, did not change the age qualification for governorship and Senate; both were retained at 35 years.
