There has been so much talk about the fuel souvenir paradox. Even as I write this, there are fresh comments on the issue, calling for the arrest of the celebrant and attendees. However, the more I think about the kind gesture of some Nigerians I have met or heard about, the more I am persuaded that the recent action by the newly installed Erelu Okin, Chidinma Pearl Ogbulu, who distributed gallons of premium motor spirit as souvenir at Havilah Event Centre in Lagos is a gesture beyond a gift. To a large extent, it is a sheer reflection of being your sister’s or brother’s helper in times of want.
 
That being said, it is important to note that, one reason so much fuss was made about the fuel souvenir is that, traditionally, Nigerians behave strangely rowdy when gift items are shared at occasions and many are prone to being careless. More so, there is no template for predicting a disaster in which people should take precaution. Hence, it has been reported that some of the attendees pointed out the danger and ordered the stop of distribution. However, from her unreserved apology, one could denote that the souvenir was merely assumed as an appreciation for those who graced the occasion and perhaps in her own little way to salvage the agony Nigerians are passing through since the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) created the recent fuel scarcity when it allowed adulterated fuel into the market. Indeed, the horrible tales and endless queue in petrol stations particularly in Lagos and Abuja made the product become so precious like gold overnight and a likely cherished gift when packaged in gallons customised with inscriptions and pictures of the giver.
