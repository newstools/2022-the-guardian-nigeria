Football lovers intending to watch Nigeria’s Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier in Abuja now have opportunity to do so courtesy of the Director General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Olusegun Runsewe. The NCAC boss has promised to give free tickets to the first 500 football fans in stadium to watch the match holding on March 29. According to Runsewe, fans, who come to the stadium wearing Nigeria’s national colour of green white green, will be given added advantage. Speaking in Abuja, yesterday, he said the role played by sports as a unifying factor in the country couldn’t be overemphasised, adding that sports and culture, which form the basis for the development of any nation, are interwoven. Runsewe, who doubles as the president of the Nigeria Golf Federation (NGF), also revealed that NCAC, apart from mobilising three million online culture friendly fan base to support the Super Eagles during the FIFA World Cup in Russia in 2018, also mobilised 10 million virtual supporters for the Eagles during the last AFCON in Cameroun. He urged Nigerians to put the early exit of the Super Eagles from the AFCON in Cameroun behind them and back the squad to qualify for the Mundial. “It is time we put the early exit from the AFCON behind us and stay focused on Nigeria qualifying for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. We cannot continue to talk about Eagles not going far in the tournament after showing so much promise at the group stage,” he reiterated. He urged Nigerians to give maximum support to Super Eagles to qualify for the Qatar World Cup, saying it will serve as a good platform to once again market Nigeria’s rich and diverse culture, arts and crafts, thereby, attracting global patronage, which, according to him, will translate to massive Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for the country even after the fiesta.
