Prays For Injury-Free Squad
Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen, has said that his game plan for the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup play-off against the Black Stars of Ghana would be centred around most of the players that persecuted the recently-concluded Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun. Eguavoen told The Guardian shortly before he released his provisional list that he was delighted that most of the players that took part in the AFCON tournament are fully active in their various clubs and performing well to his expectations. He stated that he is not under pressure ahead of the FIFA World Cup qualifier against Ghana. The ex-Enyimba of Aba manager also noted that the Super Eagles had put behind the AFCON round of 16 defeat to Tunisia to focus on the clash against Ghana, whom he believe would want to give the Super Eagles a good fight to pick the vital World Cup ticket. “My plan is that most of the players that were in Cameroun for the AFCON will form the bulk of the team for the World Cup qualifier. There will few additions to beef up the team. I pray most of my players are injury-free and fit to play against Ghana because the game will be tough. I am happy with the performance of the players in their various leagues. They are playing regularly, which is important and good to build a formidable squad. Also, we are working hard to ensure their clubs release them on time for the match,” he said. On his working relationship with Emmanuel Amuneke, Eguavoen said: “There is no conflict of duties. Our vision is to assemble a formidable Super Eagles team that will excel. We are working together as one. Nobody is a subordinate to another. The Eagles technical crew is focused to raise a quality team. There are assumptions in some quarters that my working relationship with Amuneke in the Super Eagles will not work well. We are matured, experienced coaches and ex- Super Eagles players ready to work as one family.”
