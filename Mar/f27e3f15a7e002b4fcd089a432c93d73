Delta State Police Command, yesterday, vowed to arrest the three-man armed gang, which abducted 30-year-old Stephanie Ejiofor,  at Isheagu Community in  Aniocha South Local Council of the state.
 
Spokesperson for the command, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Bright Edafe, who confirmed the incident to The Guardian yesterday, said that the command has spread its dragnet to arrest the fleeing gang.
   
It was learnt that the three-man gang alighted from an unmarked dark-coloured car at the residence of the victim at Isheagu Quarters at about 12 noon yesterday, opened fire in the air, bundled her into their waiting vehicle and zoomed off.  According to her, the armed men pulled down her door with their legs and pushed her into their car. She lamented that the victim has been kidnapped twice within three years. “In December 2019, she was abducted at her residence in Ukpilla, Edo State in similar circumstance. She was released after five days. Her family parted with undisclosed amount of money,” she said.
