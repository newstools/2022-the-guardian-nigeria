Chairmen, Forum of African Democratic Congress (ADC) in the 36 states of the Federation and Abuja, yesterday, raised concern over issues confronting the nation and asked the Federal Government to tackle them, particularly insecurity and ASUU strike without unnecessary delay. A communiqué signed by the Chairman of the forum, Prince Joe Chukwu, made available to journalists in Asaba, Delta State, read: “The havoc being wrecked by rebellious individuals is deadly and there is a need for new security tactics to arrest this ugly trend. We call on government at all levels to rise to the occasion and fulfil their primary duty of safeguarding life and properties. “ADC leadership commends Nigerians for their support to the group as one of the foremost political parties in Nigeria with a conscious commitment to the advancement and unity of Nigeria in all areas of our nation’s life. “ADC Chairmen’s Forum also frowned on the current ASUU strike in Nigeria. We are calling on Federal Government to negotiate with them for the good of Nigerian students, the growth and development of the education sector in the country. The forum flayed the lingering face-off between ASUU and the Federal Government that has disoriented the university system. “This culture of disruption of the academic programme by ASUU strikes keeps frustrating the ambitions and aspirations of Nigerian students in the process of acquiring knowledge. This latest episode calls for concern and a rethink. This is the 16th strike since Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999. Despite the numbers, there is little to show” ADC called on the Federal Government to look into the demand of ASUU and settle the issue, saying that the tertiary institution is the research centre for national growth and development.
