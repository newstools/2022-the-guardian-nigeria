 Will Smith and Chris Rock Will Smith left viewers in shock after he slapped Chris Rock on stage at the 94th Oscars. The 53 year old actor who clinched the trophy for best actor for his role in the Biopic film King Richard, was outraged by a joke from Chris Rock about his wife’s bald head(alopecia).   Chris Rock joked, “Jada I love you, ‘G.I. Jane 2,’ can’t wait to see it.” Will Smith, not pleased with that, walked to Rock and appeared to smack him on the face that left the atmosphere at the Dolby Theater in dead silence. Now back at his seat, Will Smith yells “Keep my wife’s name out of your f***ing mouth!” and Rock’s reaction to all that had happened was “That was the greatest night in the history of television.” Will Smith’s manner of standing up for his wife has been condemned by stars and fans alike. Notably director Judd Apatow describes Smith’s outburst as  ‘’Pure out of control rage and violence’’. Shortly after the unprecedented drama, Will Smith climbed the stage to receive his award and apologised to his colleagues for the incident without directly calling Chris Rock’s name. He also ended his speech saying that he hoped he would be welcomed back by the Academy. Willow Smith is yet to respond to the reaction of her father but Jaden take to his twitter account to tweet ”And That’s How We Do It”. A tweet which has been retweeted more than 42,000 times and was trailed with with mixed responses from social media users. However Will Smith’s act has called for a withdrawal of his awards for flouting the Academy’s code of conduct rules set up at the rise of  the Me Too movement.
