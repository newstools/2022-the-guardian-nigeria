Lagos State is set to host the country’s largest automotive parts show, as the West Africa Automotive Show (WAAS) will be held from May 17 to 19. More than 100 exhibitors from Nigeria and around the world are expected to showcase up-to-date developments and products in the auto parts and services sector to more than 3,000 visitors from West Africa.  “We are delighted to be able to bring the long-anticipated return of the West Africa Automotive Show back to Nigeria for its first post-pandemic edition.
 
“Demand for exhibition space has been very high, which reflects the strong desire from the market to get back to business and make up for a lost time. The impact of the pandemic on international trade was huge, so the exhibition will act as a perfect platform for businesses to find new suppliers from around the world and suppliers to find new customers across the region,” Hill said.
