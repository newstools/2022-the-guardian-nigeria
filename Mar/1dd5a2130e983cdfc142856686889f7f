The Katsina Area Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) says it has only three recognised checkpoints along Katsina-Jibia Road. Alhaji Dalha Wada-Chedi, the Acting Controller of the command, said this during a Customs/Community Forum on Monday in Jibia, Katsina State. Wada-Chedi was responding to complaints by some community leaders of Jibia border towns over hardship they encounter due to the large number of security checkpoints along the road. “I have said it time without number that along the 44 kilometer Katsina-Jibia road, we have only three checkpoints. “The checkpoints are at Earth mile, Agangaro and Dan-Aru. Then we have two patrol bases, one at Natsinta and the other one at Makera. “Apart from these, any other place you see a customs officer, please inform us. “We have made so many examples, in fact we have arrested some and we are trying to prosecute some. “We are even in the process of investigating the issue. So, the way people keep on talking about 30-40 checkpoints along the road, they should find out how many are customs check points.” He told the community members to also make similar complain to other sister security agencies about the check points along the road. “You know our  Comptroller General, (GCC), retired Col. Hamid Ali hate corruption, and any corrupt officer found guilty, definitely will be dealt with. “Therefore, help us get those corrupt officers and we will send them for prosecution,” Wada-Chedi said.
