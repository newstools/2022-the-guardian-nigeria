 Pigs-in-a-Blanket.-Photo-Lil-Luna Congratulations! You made it to the weekend. After what seems like endless days of meeting different deadlines and tolerating your obnoxious boss, you finally get to have two complete days that allow you to take a deep breath, focus on yourself, and relax. While the weekend might be the perfect time to go out with friends or go on a date with a random stranger who looks just like the Tinder Swindler or Anna Delvey, it is also the perfect opportunity for you to make use of the abandoned oven in your kitchen. Rather than buying items like cakes or cookies, you could decide to put your cooking skills to the test. What better way to truly test your culinary skills than the delicious appetizer called “Pigs in a blanket?” We know some of you might have zero clue on how to go about preparing this snack, which is why we provided the recipe to guide you. Ingredients Preparation Baking is fun. Now cancel those hangout plans, go to the market, put on an apron, and show us what you’ve got.
