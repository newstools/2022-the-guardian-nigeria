In the spirit of #BreakingTheBias, here are some harmful cultural practices that women face in some parts of the world. It is the 21st century but UNICEF has drawn attention to female genital mutilation (FGM) or female circumcision that still plagues most African societies In Nigeria, it is estimated that over 20 million of the female gender in Nigeria have passed through this process and Nigeria globally being the third on the list. Unicef representative to Nigeria, Peter Hawkins estimates that 19.9 million women and girls who have survived FMG and that 86 percent of females were cut before the age of five whereas eight percent between ages five and 14. Considered as a rite of passage, in Kenya this practice is also being kicked against by many women, and the practise sometimes leads to bleeding and even death. The risk of objecting to circumcision in Kenya implies that such defiant girls were not fit for marriage and face the consequences for that. Having no health benefits to girls and women this cultural practice has been asked to be brought to a halt by women and various organisations which therefore #BreakTheBias that physically and mentally scare women and girls around the world. In other parts of the world like Bulgaria, in the village of Stara Zagora women are sold to prospective husbands, and the woman’s dowry cost rises in value if she is pretty and has a good reputation. This cultural practice dates back to hundreds of years ago and takes place in the fields outside town. Popularly known as the ‘‘Gypsy bride market’’ it takes place on the first Saturday of Orthodox Christian Lent. Women come out with their daughters to the bride market with hopes of getting a husband. This society largely values a girls worth on her virginity. The marriage ways do not end here because in countries like South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Ethiopia but common in Central Asia and Caucasus, marriage by abduction is a prevalent cultural practice in this diverse societies. The list of women being endangered from cultural beliefs lingers into practices of women being given as a debt settlement, in places like Thailand where the Padaung women have to stretch their necks and shackle their legs with gold coils. In some stages of women’s history, women have generally existed as second class citizens like in ancient East Asia the practice of Sati meant that if a woman’s husband died, she was to die as well but in contemporary times women have been able to keep #BreakingTheBias that have long existed in their societies. As such women are paving the way for a safer and equal society to live and thrive in without bias.
