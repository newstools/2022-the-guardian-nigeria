One major highlight making rounds is the moment when actor Will Smith struck comedian Chris Rock for making a G.I. Jane joke directed at Jada Smith (his wife). So what’s the tea on the G.I. Jane joke that earned Chris Rock a snack across his face? Well, G.I. Jane is the name of a 1997 film played by Demi Moore. In the Ridley Scott Directed movie, Jordan O’Neill a female Naval officer makes it through Navy SEAL training and has to break into the traditionally all-male occupation. To blend in, O’Neill adopts a rugged male personality which included her shaving her head. So, when Chris Rock said “Jada can’t wait for G.I. 2,” he referenced her playing the lead role due to her shaved head.” However his joke was distasteful as Jada’s decision to cut her hair wasn’t a fashionable one, but medically required. Jada has always been open about experiencing hair loss due to the autoimmune disorder alopecia that impacts the hair follicles, resulting in both bald spots and hair loss. Last year, the actress made the decision to cut her hair after it became harder to keep hiding it with the turbans she rocked for the last few years. “Now at this point, I can only laugh,” she said in an Instagram video in December 2021 as she ran her finger across a bald line patch on her scalp. “Y’all know I’ve been struggling with alopecia and just all of a sudden one day, look at this line right here. Look at that.”
