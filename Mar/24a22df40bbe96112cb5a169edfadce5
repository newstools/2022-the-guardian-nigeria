The rapper made this know at during the American Song Contest red carpet.   “The BTS experience you keep talking about. I’m going to let them tell you about it. It’s official like a referee with a whistle. I love that entertainment world. It’s good music. It’s [a] vibe. I make good music. They make good music. And we end up doing this. This is what it’s always about, bringing our worlds together.” Snoop Dogg had in recent times talked in a podcast ‘Mogul Talk’ about how he had gotten a request from BTS to work with them. Speaking further he also explained while on the  show,  that he had no understanding of how prominent the K-pop group was, and was enlightened by his nephew who is familiar about the Korean band.
