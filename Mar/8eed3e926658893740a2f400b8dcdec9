A 13-YEAR-OLD pupil of Cedarville Montessori School, Magbon Ibiye, Lagos, has dragged her proprietress, Mrs. Kemi Omoyah and husband, Mr. Omoyah before a Lagos High Court, Yaba, for allegedly bullying her and violating her rights.
   
In the suit filed through her mother and founder, Boys Lives Matter, Nkechi Macaulay,  the teenager is demanding  the sum of N5 million from Mr. and Mrs Omayah jointly as exemplary damages for the violation of her fundamental rights.
    
She also wants the sum of N1 million as special damages for the cost of the suit and the sum of N400,000 to cover the costs of her therapy sessions.
   
According to the teenager, the award against her proprietress was in the interest of justice  and for  violation of her fundamental right to the dignity of her person, by maliciously subjecting her to circumstances wherein she was humiliated and embarrassed before all her classmates and members of other classes.  She said: “ I was invited alongside  four of my classmates and at least four teachers, who began  to quarrel with me, over a statement I made to another student in my class.
 
“I had told the student in question, months before, that a former student of the school had mentioned to me that a charm had been buried in the school. “At the time, Mrs. Omayah told me that it was the Holy Spirit that told her that I had been saying that a charm was buried in the school, to other students of the school.
   
“Without giving me any opportunity to speak on the matter, she started hurling insults and accusations at me, in the following words, ‘you have a bad heart’ you are trying to bring down the school spiritually.’  You are possessed by evil spirits.’
