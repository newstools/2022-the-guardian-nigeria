Stay afloat the pressure with these outfit inspiration ideas that’ll have you looking like a snack in no time. First things first, there’s no one outfit for every occasion, so choosing an outfit should depend on where you are headed. Whether you’re going to the movies, out for dinner or grabbing a cup of coffee, here are some great date night outfit ideas: A more casual outing movie dates don’t require you to go fully kitted up, but let’s not go too casual. Opt for simple clothing choices that blend casual and dressed up clothing items. Choose wide flair pants and a cute top to keep you cosy and looking chic. Pair this with some sneakers, low heels or sandals. If you’re a dress lady, mini dresses or flair dress, take the lead on this one, paired with flats or low heels and accessorise liberally.

Choose a stylish dress with exaggerated details, whether it is cut-outs, off the shoulder, fringe or stylish designs. Black and white work best for a lasting impression, but you can throw in other colours that flatter your skin tone, like red for dark skins and pink for fair-skinned people. If you’re a trouser type of girl, leather pants, wide-leg trousers paired with statement tops. For your legs, you can never go wrong with the right pair of sandal heels, oh! Remember to match your shoes and purse together; it’s an elegant style tip that has lasted centuries ;). When accessorising, maybe keep the wristwatch aside and replace it with bracelets; add some earrings and a necklace to finish.

Depending on what type of concert it is and the weather condition, you have to pick your outfit to match. So for cold December nights, a leather jacket would definitely come in helpful paired with a pair of boots or sneakers for comfort. Mini dresses for hot nights are also paired with sneakers with a matching bag. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1684082 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sneakers-on-a-bodycon-dress-photo-heygorjess.-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sneakers-on-a-bodycon-dress-photo-heygorjess.-1.jpg 800w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sneakers-on-a-bodycon-dress-photo-heygorjess.-1-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sneakers-on-a-bodycon-dress-photo-heygorjess.-1-640x426.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sneakers-on-a-bodycon-dress-photo-heygorjess.-1-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Concert outfit ideas Photo Pinterest Concert Outfit ideas Photo Pinterest
