Newly released data from the International Data Corporation (IDC) Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker shows that Africa’s overall mobile phone market suffered a year-on-year (YoY) decline of 11.3 per cent in Q4 2021 to total 48.6 million units. The feature phone market was down 14.3 per cent to 27.1 million units, while smartphone shipments declined 7.1 per cent to 21.5 million units.
  
IDC noted that Africa’s major smartphone markets (South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya and Egypt) all experienced a downturn in Q4 2021, except South Africa, which saw slight YoY growth. Global supply shortages were the main reason for the declines seen across the region, while Egypt was further hampered by the introduction of new tariffs amounting to 10 per cent on mobile phone imports.  “Considering the macroeconomic challenges faced by economies across the region, African governments will keep an eye on taxes and import tariffs on mobile phones. New import tariffs and increased tax rates have been implemented in North African countries and similar changes can be expected in many other African markets shortly,” he added.
