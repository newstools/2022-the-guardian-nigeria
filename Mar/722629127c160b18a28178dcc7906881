• Oil firms consider trucking as theft pushes production cost to $32/b
• Insecurity rubbishes govt’s $10/b bid as losses hit 91%
• NUPRC, IOCs, independent producers seek urgent solutions
• HURIWA faults FG over $3.27bn crude theft, says FG must name, shame economic saboteurs
• Ex-NEITI boss warns against exaggerating figures, wants comprehensive action Nearly two years after the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited announced plans to reduce the cost of oil production to about $10 per barrel, this effort has been frustrated by recurring oil theft, spiking production costs to at least $32 a barrel.
   
With losses from pipeline vandalisation and theft overwhelming international oil companies (OICs), many are already moving to the deep offshore region, while indigenous firms contend with rising operational expenses driven mostly by personnel, maintenance and security costs.
     
According to some operators who reluctantly spoke with The Guardian, oil is no longer stolen at the well-heads, as vandals have become innovative, bypassing the anti-ballistic pipelines to disrupt production.
  
Indeed, they have raised concerns about the culpability of the nation’s security agencies, noting that barges of oil could not have been stolen and moved on the coastal waters without collaboration of some powerful Nigerians.  Nigeria lost $3.2 billion in crude oil theft between January 2021 and February 2022, according to the statistics presented at a meeting in Abuja, last Thursday, between the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Oil Producers Trade Section, and the Independent Petroleum Producers Group (IPPG) to discuss crude oil theft. This puts the figure to about N1.36 trillion when converted to naira with the official N416.25 to dollar exchange rate, a development that has forced the country’s crude oil production to go way below quotas by Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and benchmark in the 2022 budget. The Guardian gathered that only five per cent of all the crude oil that were pumped through the pipeline between October 2021 and February 2022 were received by producers. The rest were lost to illegal oil bunkering, a problem that seems to have taken a turn for the worse since global oil prices skyrocketed. Voicing his frustration over the problem, Tony Elumelu, who owns huge stakes in Tenoil, in a series of tweets earlier last week, said: “Businesses are suffering. How can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000 barrels of crude oil daily, instead it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator, Shell to declare force majeure, which has taken a toll on their businesses. “Why are we paying taxes if our security agencies can’t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!” Also last week, another stakeholder and founding Managing Director of Seplat Petroleum, Austin Avuru, released a report in which he warned that oil production in Nigeria is now in an emergency, critical state, due to oil theft. In the report, titled, “Reining in the Collapse of the Nigerian Oil Industry,” Avuru disclosed that some oil producers no longer get to see as much as 80 per cent of their production making it to the terminals. He also urged the authorities to do something about the problem.
 
Despite the existing heavy presence of tankers across roads in Nigeria lifting oil products and other goods, crude oil producers are now adopting the option of trucking crude as multiple sources confirmed to The Guardian, that the average cost of producing a barrel of crude oil is now $32 per barrel. This makes Nigeria one of the countries with the highest cost of crude oil production in the world.
  
Beyond taxes, industry insight showed that high expenditure driven mainly by high number of personnel (including security agencies), logistics and handling costs had pushed the unit operating price of oil to $20/bbl pre-Coronavirus.
   
A breakdown of associated expenses in the industry showed that of the over 70 per cent operating costs, human resource services account for 38 per cent, logistics 19 per cent, 13 per cent for direct handling and nine per cent direct lifting among others.
   
The NNPC equally spent N32.56 billion on pipeline security and maintenance cost within the first seven months last year, above the N29.6 billion budgeted for the year, reflecting a rising incident of vandalism and frequency in maintenance. Stakeholders believe the costs must have risen, even as they await the latest report from the oil company.
  
The operators told The Guardian that crude oil theft is killing Nigeria’s oil business, as it is no longer sustainable. The upstream challenges have forced operators to consider divestment, just as they added that the amnesty programme was no longer yielding results for the country, as it has remained another conduit for corruption going by the number of leakages and vandalisation in the region.  BUT Waziri Adio, former executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI), noted that oil theft is not the only reason for the underperformance of the petroleum sector. Last Wednesday, a Federal Government team visited a site in Rivers State where they said oil theft was going on. The delegation was led by the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva. Commenting on the development, yesterday, Adio commended government for finally taking the issue more seriously, noting “the increasingly audacious and humongous theft of crude oil and refined products poses a multiplicity of threats to oil companies and all tiers of governments, to the environment, to the livelihoods of citizens and communities, and, most importantly, to national security.” However, he said: “It is important to go beyond clever soundbites and photo-ops. It will also be necessary not to return to the same measures that have proven grossly ineffective over the time, and not to succumb to schemes designed merely to take advantage of the situation.” Adio, who presided over NEITI between 2016 and 2021, said it is critical to get the accurate figures of the theft as a starting point. “There have been screaming headlines and viral tweets that between 80 per cent and 95 per cent of Nigeria’s crude oil is lost to oil thieves. This cannot be true. Anyone with little familiarity with the sector should question the figures being touted. “Nigeria’s oil production figures can easily be accessed locally and internationally. Our oil production, minus condensates, has hovered between 1.2 million and 1.4 million barrels per day for some time now, due to reduced OPEC quota and other factors. “As low as they are, these figures do not represent 20 per cent or five per cent of our daily production. Even if we put Nigeria’s daily oil production at one million barrels, saying the country is losing between 80 to 95 per cent of its oil production will suggest that Nigeria is producing between five million and 20 million barrels of crude oil per day. That would be nice but it is simply not true. Our record daily production till date remains 2.7 million barrels, and that record was set in 2005.” He said as serious as the issue of oil theft is, “we don’t need to sex up the numbers or encourage misrepresentation.”
ALSO, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) yesterday, lambasted the Federal Government over its disclosure that about $3.27 billion worth of oil had been lost to theft in the last 14 months. It noted that the government, having indicted itself with the revelation, should speedily ensure that the economic saboteurs in government and outside government were named, shamed and prosecuted for deterrence purpose. HURIWA, in a statement by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, said the disclosure by the government was useless and was of no benefit to Nigerians. The group also said the outrageous amount lost to oil thieves amid fuel scarcity for about two months in first quarter of 2022 showed the obvious failure of Buhari, who should quickly quit as Minister of Petroleum Resources. He said: “How can Nigerians be in the midst of plenty and still suffer incurable and perpetual scarcity because of the leadership failure of some people? The President should resign as Petroleum Minister having demonstrated gargantuan incompetence.” Reacting to the NUPRC report of crude oil theft leading to the loss of $3.27 billion worth of oil in the last 14 months, HURIWA slammed the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, as well as all agencies involved, including NUPRC, NNPC and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Authority for failing Nigerians by allegedly covering the theft for 14 months.
