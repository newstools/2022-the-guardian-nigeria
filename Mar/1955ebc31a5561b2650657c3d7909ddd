Urges mobilisation for protest against subsidy removal Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), has called for the sack of the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva and other top management staff of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). It called on the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC), National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and others against fuel subsidy removal to start mobilising for a grand nationwide protest. Even as President Muhammadu Buhari is in charge of the petroleum ministry, the coalition urged the aforementioned stakeholders to demand the resignation of Sylva, the top management staff of NNPC and all other functionaries for allegedly “creating this recurrent problem in the oil sector.” In a statement, yesterday, in Abuja, the CNG Director, Strategic Communications, Samaila Musa, urged the Senate president to know that all efforts to retain the subsidy is being scuttled by the very people serving the government. It added, however, that “there is still time to call them to order.” CNG condemned the alleged plan to scuttle the subsidy regime, which the NNPC and the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources deliberately, via their cronies, imported and which did not only damage people’s vehicles but also created artificial fuel scarcity that brought economic activities to a standstill. Musa said: “We are appealing to all Nigerians irrespective of their ethnic, religious, regional or political differences to prepare to troop out to the streets en masse to challenge this flimflam. “We reiterate our position that these people are incompetent and incapable of managing Nigeria’s oil industry effectively for the benefit of all. We were reliably informed that some influential people in the Presidency, leadership of the NNPC, Ministry of Petroleum Resources and some marketers have been orchestrating chaos in a coordinated manner in the petroleum sector after they failed to remove fuel subsidy.”
