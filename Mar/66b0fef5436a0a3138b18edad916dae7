According to Dr Craig Rogers of Henry Ford Health System, one in eight men will get Prostate cancer. If discovered early, prostate cancer is treatable. Here are the basics you need to know concerning prostate cancer. Prostate cancers can be classified based on the speed of adenocarcinoma growth, the stage of tumour growth, and the degree of the normalcy of prostate tissue. In terms of speed of growth, prostate cancer may be classified as aggressive (fast-growing) or non-aggressive. Non-aggressive cancers may remain the same size for years. The Gleason classification system classifies the speed of growth based on the degree of the normalcy of prostate tissue. A score from 1 to 5 is assigned. A score below 3 means tissue is normal, while 5 indicates a fast-growing tumour. Prostate cancer typically develops quietly; these signs and symptoms may be seen when the disease is advanced Age 40: men with very high risk, e.g., those with a first-degree relative who developed prostate cancer before 65. Age 45: high risk; men subject to ethnic disposition or second-degree relative with prostate cancer Age 50: average risk; third-degree relative, obesity, or other similar complications.
