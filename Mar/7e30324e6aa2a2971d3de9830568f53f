The OMIS Award has called on stakeholders to nominate deserving personnel and organizations in the maritime sector for its inaugural edition. The organizers of the award, HSENations International, a firm with interests in the field of health, safety, security and environment (HSSE), and marketing communication/media consultancy disclosed this in a statement. Chair of the Governing Board of the award, Jean Chiazor-Anishere, SAN, said that The OMIS Award “identifies individuals and organizations with the best Maritime safety policies and procedures, is the tonic the maritime industry and the country at large need to inspire the attainment of international best standards and foreign investments for economic growth and job employment for our teeming youths. “I personally applaud this laudable initiative and trust that it will sustain the test of time.” Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Award, Femi Da-silva explained, “the maritime sector is recognized globally as a critical component in world trade and a gateway to the economy of coastal countries, including Nigeria. “Despite the strategic importance of maritime, which employs hundreds of thousands in Nigeria alone, the efforts of personnel and organizations at developing this sector, subsequently boosting the nation’s economy, are not being adequately recognized and celebrated. “The OMIS Award has stepped in to fill this void, recognizing that awards boost morale, leading to greater job satisfaction and improved productivity, and is a clarion call for greater service.” He further explained that the award aims to serve as a catalyst for the continued development of the sector through the appreciation of the most silent but incredible work that is being done by stakeholders; to highlight innovations and achievements in the field as well as raise awareness and beam the searchlight on important issues that do not always get the attention they deserve, and subsequently promote further improvement. Da-silva added that the general public/maritime stakeholders can nominate deserving individuals and organizations in the maritime sector for this award through https://www.theomisaward.com.
