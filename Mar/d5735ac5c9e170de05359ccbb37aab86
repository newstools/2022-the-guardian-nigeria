Sound turns to noise when it is unpleasant or harmful to the ears. Attention is not usually given to noise pollution as compared to air and water pollution. In some parts of Nigeria, particularly, cities and major towns, noise is regarded as an indication that those areas are developed. That an urban area is characterised by its busy day-to-day economic and social activities, does not necessarily translate to a noisy city as believed by many. True, and to a large extent, city life is a noisy life.  Òrúnbon, an opinion writer, poet, journalist and public affairs analyst, wrote from Federal Housing Estate, Olomore, Abeokuta, Ogun State.
