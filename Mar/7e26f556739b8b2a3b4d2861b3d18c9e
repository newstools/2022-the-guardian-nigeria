The member representing Nkwerre State Constituency in Imo State House of Assembly, Obinna Okwara, has dumped the All Progressive Congress, APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Okwara was one of the lawmakers who were suspended on 23rd December, 2021, by the leadership of the House for alleged unparliamentary conduct and insubordination to the leadership of the House. Pictures of Okwara picking up his PDP membership card had gone viral. But the lawmaker insisted that he has not made any official statement about the development nor communicated on the floor of the House. He stressed that until he did such, “people are free to say and believe anything from the video.” “I have been sympathetic of APC because of my love for Governor Hope Uzodinma but such should not be on the altar of my political ambition,” Obinna said. “I did everything within my power without fear or favour to support Uzodinma to succeed. Hence I supported all his policies and programmes. He continued, “I have intention to recontest for state of Assembly in 2023 but I am not seeing any future in APC on that so I am being left to take my faith by my hand. “So if I should rejoin PDP, it is to enhance my 2023 political ambition. Remember I am a democrat and founding member of PDP. “But about the rumour of my defection to PDP, yes I visited my friends in PDP and had some discussions with them. Details of what transpired may be made known later.” The embattled Imo lawmaker also described the Speaker, as the worst the state has ever had since its creation. According to him, “Kennedy Ibe says one thing and does another. He has no regard for the legislative arm of the state and he is doing more harm than good to the Governor. Honestly I am surprised by his attitude and everything about him now shocking.”
