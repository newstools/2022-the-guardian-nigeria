Group faults party’s zoning of national offices Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has affirmed his commitment to the success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a party. While receiving the Chairman, Senate Services Committee, Mohammed Musa, who is also eyeing the APC chairmanship position, yesterday, the governor emphasised the need for all party members to work together for a successful national convention. Musa visited to congratulate the governor on his appointment as the acting Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) for the conduct of the national convention billed for this month. HOWEVER, Indigenous People of Nigeria (IPN) has faulted the zonal arrangement for national offices of the APC. Briefing newsmen in Abuja, yesterday, Convener of IPON, Nnamdi Iroegbu, said the arrangement was a manifest insensitivity to the multi-ethnic setting of the country, insisting that it portended danger to the corporate existence of the country. The group had earlier written to the National Secretariat of APC for the party to be guided when allocating leadership offices, but regretted that the final list, which was released on Wednesday by Bello was contrary to the popular advocacy of the need to unite the country.
