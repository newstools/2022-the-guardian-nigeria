A house parent in  Dowen College, Lagos, Omobola Kayode, yesterday, refuted claims that the late 12-year-old student of the College, Sylvester Oromoni Junior got injured, while playing football.
   
Kayode, who trained as a nurse in Ukraine,  testified before a Lagos coroner inquest to unravel the cause of Oromoni’s death. The witness, who joined the school on November 7, 2021, told Coroner Magistrate Mikhail  Kadiri, that she massaged the deceased’s right thigh twice.
 
She told the court that the deceased told her that he had pain and muscle pull when he wanted to pick his bible that fell from the bed.
