Traditional rulers of Umuahia North Council of Abia State, yesterday, distanced themselves from the seven traditional rulers of Ohuhu Clan, who visited Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, last week over the zoning of the governorship position in the next dispensation. The seven royal fathers of Ohuhu Clan, led by the Chairman of Ohuhu Traditional Rulers Council, Eze Nnamdi Ofoegbu of Umudiawa Autonomous Community, had, during their visit to Ikpeazu, urged him to choose his successor from the Ukwa Ngwa bloc to give the area the chance to govern the state for another eight years and make up the 16 years in which the Old Bende bloc held sway. They dissociated themselves from the seven Ohuhu traditional rulers at a media briefing addressed by their Chairman, Eze John Ibezim at his Amuzukwu palace. He said the traditional rulers of Umuahia North did not, and will not tell the political class how they should organise their activities in terms of who takes what as that is left for the politicians. Ibezim said it was reported that the seven traditional rulers submitted that it was still the turn of Ngwa to produce the governor in 2023 and that they did not believe in the pattern of zoning whereas they also told the governor that it was the turn of Ohuhu to produce the member of the House of Representatives. Stressing that the media briefing was held to tell Nigerians that the Umuahia North Council of Traditional Rulers was not involved in the Ohuhu seven stand, Ibezim advised that the pattern of rotation of the state’s governorship position always rotated among the zones. He stressed that the arrangement had kept the Abia State united and peaceful, insisting that the agreement should be maintained to ensure the continued peace and stability of the state.
