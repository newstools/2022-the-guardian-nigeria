Tonight we are delighted to celebrate our 94th Academy Awards winners, who deserve this moment of recognition from their peers and movie lovers around the world.” However a source confirmed why an immediate decision could not be made by the board at the ceremony on Sunday “There were immediate discussions but the Academy decision makers were seated in various spots in the Dolby Theatre and couldn’t mobilise to make a decision before he won best actor.”   A stronger message by the board was issued revealing they had begun a “formal review around the incident” that intends to “explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law.” This incident leaves Will Smith’s first Oscar win on the line as the Academy Board looks into the matter. On the other hand with further probing into the matter which involved the police, the Los Angeles Police Department said that Chris Rock decided not to press charges over the incident with Will Smith. After the tweet by the Academy, according to sources, the Academy’s Board of Governors with no disciplinary power,made up of influential members who are actors and directors, had a virtual meeting on Monday morning concerning the altercation between Smith and Rock. The meeting was said to be “heated” and “divided” without resolution.
