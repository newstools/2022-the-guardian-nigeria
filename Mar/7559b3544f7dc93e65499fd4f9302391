The CBN Junior Tennis Championship taking place at the Lagos Lawn Tennis Club recorded a major upset at the semifinal stage yesterday with Bright Emmanuel upstaging Khadijat Mohammed, the national under 14 champion and winner of three consecutive titles. Emmanuel, who lost to Mohammed in the finals of the Sapetro Futures Championship last year, played a very consistent and determined game to win 9-6 and book her place in the Girls 14 finals. Speaking on his ward, coach Kolade Tomiwa, who runs the junior program at the Apapa Club said: “She really deserved the victory. Since she lost to Khadijat late last year she has had revenge on her mind and she moved really well, going for all balls and placing them superbly.” Emmanuel will meet Success Ogunjobi from Ekiti, who beat Justinah Emmanuel 9-5l in the second semifinals. There was also a near-upset in the boys 16s semifinal, where Bode Lawal from the Ikoyi Club, played a close match with top seed Seun Ogunsakin from Ekiti but was eventually overpowered 9-7. Ogunsakin’s perennial rival, Ganiyu Mubarak, also came close to being upset but managed to overcome Jeremiah Benjamin from the host club 9-7. The Girls 12 will feature Ndidi Osaji against Ndifreke Benjamin, while the Girls 10 will have Favour Okon-James from Akwa Ibom and Mofi Atilola from the Lagos Lawn Tennis club. Murewa Egbeyemi will have to defend his boys10 and under title against the new kid on the block, Dubem Amasian, in a match expected to be one of the highlights of the grand finale. The boys 12 final will be between Seyi Ogunsakin and Husseini Ayoola, while the boy’s 14 will have Joseph Ogunyemi facing Joel Benjamin. The grand finale, expected to feature some side attractions, is scheduled to start at 13.00 today.
