The upcoming 2023 elections provide another opportunity for the Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to accomplish its life-long dream: defeating the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the governorship polls. This would, however, remain a tall dream if party stakeholders cannot work as a team. As things stand, a good number of stakeholders seem to be finding it difficult to agree to a resolution of the internal crises that have always been a setback for the party since 1999.
 
In view of the disquiet trailing the party’s state congress held on February 28, which produced a former Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Tourism in Lagos State, Mr. Philip Aivoji, as the new chairman, the need for the party to forge a common front ahead of next general elections has become imperative.
  
But would stakeholders like former Deputy National Chairman, Chief Olabode George, Chairman of Lagos State Elders Committee of PDP, and former Minister of Cooperation and Integration in Africa, Dr. Bimbo Ogunkelu; former Lagos Deputy Governor, Mrs Kofoworola Bucknor-Akerele; Mr. Segun Adewale (aka Aeroland), immediate past state chairman, Adedeji Doherty and a host of other party faithful be ready to sheath their swords and work in the interest of the party? This is the question on the lips of many observers.  Interestingly, all the warring factions in the party see the strength of0 Lagos4Lagos Movement, as an advantage PDP could tap into to oust the ruling party next year.
