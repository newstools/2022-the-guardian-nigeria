The Ukwa-La-Ngwa Bloc has urged former Vice-Chancellor of the Abia State University (ABSU), Prof. Uche Ikonne, to fly the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as its consensus candidate, saying he should accept the offer, irrespective of his political persuasions. Led by pioneer Attorney General of the State, Chief Theo Nkire, the Ukwa-La-Ngwa Clan issued a 12-hour ultimatum to Ikonne after a top delegation visited him (Ikonne) at his Umuahia residence. It also offered to purchase the nomination and expression of interest forms for Ikonne urging him to consider their offer as a call to higher service. Addressing journalists after the meeting, Nkire said: “We came to persuade our son to run for the governorship election in 2023 because he has been tried, tested and found worthy going by his antecedents at ABSU. “He is our consensus candidate and we are asking other Ukwa-La-Ngwa aspirants to be governor position in 2023 to step down for him. He is the only one with our backing.” Asked if endorsing Ikonne, who hails from Abia Central Zone and not Abia North in line with the provisions of the Abia Charter of Equity that the position should rotate among the state’s three senatorial zones, Nkire accused crusaders of the charter of misinterpreting the document. He said the charter, which was enacted 10 years before the creation of Abia State, had recommended power rotation between the Old Bende and Aba divisions and not among the three senatorial zones of the state. Responding, Ikonne told his kinsmen that he would convey his decision on the offer after due consultations. When contacted yesterday on the 12-hour ultimatum, he told The Guardian that he would conclude his consultation by Tuesday (yesterday) night and would then be in a position to convey his decision to his kinsmen.
