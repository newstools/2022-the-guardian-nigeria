Women, especially those in the business space, have been tasked to embrace online confidentiality for security reasons.
  
This was echoed by some experts at a webinar organised by the Women Technology Empowerment Centre (W.TEC) in collaboration with Oracle Academy to celebrate 2022 International Women’s Day.
   
Programme Manager, sub-Saharan Africa, Oracle Academy, Bekere Amassoma, urged female entrepreneurs to separate their business account from the one used for personal transactions to protect it from hackers.
   
She said: “As much as technology is an enabler, we need to know that it comes with certain risks. If we do not adhere to safety rules online, cyber criminals could scam business owners as well as individuals. We can leverage technology to boost our businesses and get customers outside our location, but at the same time one needs to ensure that it is done in a safe way.
