Former international, Friday Elahoh, said he foresees a fierce battle between the Super Eagles and Ghana’s Black Stars in today’s second leg World Cup playoff in Abuja. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Elahor advised the players to play together as a unit for them to subdue the challenge of the Ghanaians. “There is no much to say about the game against the Ghanaians, than to wish Nigeria good luck. We know what happened in the first leg, which I was not too impressed with. Though, I am not the coach, but I think the line up in the first leg needs to be changed. “But again, let us look at what happens tomorrow (today) since we are playing at home. Like I have always said, we have the materials to beat any team, but it is just for the players to put their acts together and get the job done,” he said. The former Eagles’ winger also spoke on some grey areas in the team: “I don’t think there is any need mentioning names of some players who didn’t impressed me in the first leg in Ghana. But I think the Ghanaians took control of the midfield and our strikers couldn’t make any impact because they were cut off from supply. Our players should learn to dribble less and concentrate on playing together for us to qualify. “The players should not be in a hurry if goals refuse to come in the early minutes of the game. The coaches have to bring out the best of these players. Missing Ndidi (Wilfred) is not enough reason our midfield not to be organised. It is important we qualify for the World Cup. That is all what we are looking for and hopefully we shall get there,” he stated.
