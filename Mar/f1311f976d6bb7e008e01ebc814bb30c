On the activity chart, though the NGX opened the week on a strong note, the bullish momentum lost vigour as investors paused later in the week to digest corporate earnings released thus far. With midweek sell-off undermining the market performance, the NGX all-share index and market capitalisation depreciated by 0.13 per cent to close the week at 47,268.61 and N25,475 trillion respectively. Similarly, all other indices finished lower except NGX Premium, NGX AseM, NGX Meri Growth, NGX Oil/Gas and NGX Sovereign bond indices. Particularly, intense profit-taking activities witnessed in International Breweries (-9.1 per cent), Lafarge WAPCO (-8.8 per cent), National Salt Company of Nigeria (-8.3 per cent), DANGSUGAR (-7.7 per cent), United Bank for Africa (-5.2 per cent), and GUINNESS (-4.4 per cent) drove the weekly loss. Reacting on market performance and predicting activities for the week, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “We expect investors to take advantage of the significant moderation in the share prices to make a re-entry in dividend-paying stocks in the week ahead. However, we envisage a zig-zag pattern as intermittent profit-taking activities will likely persist due to medium-term expectations on the direction of yields in the fixed income market. “Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the unimpressive macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “The week traded largely bearish, as seen in the negative WTD return across the sectors except for the impressive return posted in oil and gas sector, courtesy of the bullish sentiments in SEPLAT. “We expect to see investors take advantage of the price declines in some of these counters thereby improving the market performance.”
