Nigerian flag carrier, Air Peace airline, has opened a three-weekly flight into Niamey, Niger Republic, to deepen the economic integration of the African region. Leader of the Air Peace delegation on the inaugural flight, Captain Augustin Kamano, said Niamey had always been on the airline’s radar, especially as it was poised to expand its footprints across the West African coast and interconnect different cities in the sub-region. Kamano, who doubles as the Director of Flight Operations, noted that Niger Republic and Nigeria are good neighbours and the airline is excited that it is serving as a strategic means of fostering the already existing positive relations, and further cementing the ties between the two countries through air travel. “We are determined to reduce the air travel burden of Africans, and this will continue to propel our route expansion as well as fleet modernisation programme. Air Peace has accomplished so much in just seven years of operation, as we now have a network of twenty domestic routes, seven regional routes and two international destinations, including Johannesburg, which we launched in December 2020. “Also planned for launch in the future are international routes, such as Houston-USA, Mumbai-India, Guangzhou-China and London. We’re constantly reviewing our route network in line with the travel needs of Africans,” Kamano said. Expressing gratitude to the Niger authorities and the Nigerian Government that made the airline’s entry into Niamey possible, Kamano promised that Air Peace would work concertedly with all the relevant aviation stakeholders to ensure the new route is maximised for air travellers. Nigerian Deputy Ambassador to Niger Republic, Aisha Kabiru, said that Air Peace’s entry into Niger would boost socio-cultural and economic ties between both countries and ease the burden of air travel for Nigerians and Niger nationals who connect both destinations, especially for commercial purposes.
