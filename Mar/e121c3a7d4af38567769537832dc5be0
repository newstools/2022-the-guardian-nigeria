There is no job without its inherent risks and potential hazards. However, some jobs, particularly those that involve enforcements, come with higher degrees of exposure to risks. If everyone, on grounds of fear of risks, avoid taking up such jobs, no one will be available to maintain law and order. The society is likely to become lawless if there are no law enforcers to generally caution citizens with tendencies to break the law. It is not new to hear that law enforcers are usually greeted with resistance from law breakers when carrying out their statutory duties as recommended by law. These law breakers, sometimes, in an attempt to escape punishment, resort to physical attacks and assaults on the law enforcers. It then may become more dangerous with a higher vulnerability level of exposure, if the law enforcers do not bear arms with which they can defend themselves. The General Manager of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), Mr. Bolaji Oreagba recently declared that State Government would no longer tolerate any act of assault, physical attack or attempted murder on any official working for government, especially LASTMA personnel. Oreagba stated that the perpetrators of such misdemeanors would be made to face the full wrath of the law. Assaulting uniformed personnel recently appears to be a rising trend in Lagos as this tide must be stemmed to avoid a state of lawlessness.
