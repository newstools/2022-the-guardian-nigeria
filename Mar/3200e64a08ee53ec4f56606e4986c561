Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi Tuesday said the Federal High Court in Abuja that asked him and his deputy Eric Igwe to vacate office lacks the power to give such order. Justice Inyang Ekwo gave the order after declaring the defection of the governor and his deputy to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) unconstitutional. Members of the state house of assembly who defected to APC were also sacked by the court. Commissioner of information and state orientation, Uchenna Orji, said Umahi and his deputy would appeal the judgement. While also briefing newsmen, counsel to the defendant, Chukwuma Nwachukwu Ume, SAN, described the judgement as contradictory to the constitution and Supreme Court ruling. “There is no provision against defection of the president, vice president or even the governor, or deputy governor, so the court making judgement is different from that of the Supreme Court,” Uma said. “It is obvious.”
