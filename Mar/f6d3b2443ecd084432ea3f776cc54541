Despite price gains that outweighed losses, the Nigerian stock market closed on a downward note yesterday, as profit-taking in 17 stocks dragged market capitalisation by N6 billion. Specifically, at the close of transactions yesterday, the All-Share Index declined by 11.24 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.02 per cent, to close at 47,353.22 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N6 billion to close at N25.521 trillion. The market’s negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks which are; Seplat Energy, Nigerian Breweries, Dangote Sugar Refinery, United Capital and Unilever Nigeria. Analysts at GTI Securities Limited said “Market transactions yesterday, closed bearish as investors weigh in on the impacts of the interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve on their investments. We expect Investors to trade stocks with caution and also, look out for fixed income instruments with good yields.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said: “We expect another mixed sectoral performance to close out the week, with demand in Tier-I banking names elevating activity level amid cherry-picking activities across board.” However, market breadth was positive as 18 stocks gained relative to 17 losers.
