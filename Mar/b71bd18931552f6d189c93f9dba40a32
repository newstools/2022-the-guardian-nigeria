Tyson Fury has claimed that masturbating ‘seven times a day’ is the secret to his boxing success, reports metro.co.uk.
Speaking to the Pat McAfee Show on YouTube, ‘The Gypsy King’ boxing champion, 33, said: ‘I put my success down to masturbation seven times a day. ‘Got to keep that blood pumping baby; the only thing I have been loading is testosterone from all the w***ing over the years. ‘Right hands and left hands depending on what I feel like.’ This is not the first time that Fury has admitted to using onanism to succeed. Before his second encounter with Deontay Wilder in 2020, he said: ‘I’m doing a lot of things I didn’t before. I’m eating five or six meals a day, drinking eight litres of water. ‘If it’s gonna give me an edge, I’m willing to try it. I’m masturbating seven times a day, keep my testosterone pumping.’ The boxer is gearing up for the Tyson Fury vs Dillian Whyte fight, with the details finally signed, sealed and delivered. Set to take place at London’s Wembley stadium, it’s a homecoming for Tyson, who will be defending his WBC Heavyweight World title against challenger, Whyte. It’s one of the biggest fights to take place in the UK in recent years, with two top-rated British heavyweights set to go toe-to-toe. Fury recently attended the press conference for his fight with Whyte – however, his opponent failed to attend.
Whyte is said to be angry about the fact that he will be receiving only 20 per cent of the pay for the fight – while getting nothing from pay-per-view revenue. Prices for the fight start at £55, but there will be a huge range of pricing options due to the huge arena and the typical layout of a boxing venue.
