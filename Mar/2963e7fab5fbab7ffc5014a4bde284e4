Youths in the country have been advised to embrace digital education to surmount the gap created by COVID-19. Chief Executive Officer, Woggy Boggy Digital Company, Albert Akpama, made the call at a three-day digital training held in Ibeju – Lekki, Lagos. The event was organised by Reapers Assembly in collaboration with Divine Treasures Fellowship, with the theme “Change Agent Outreach 2022.” The event offered participants digital skills training, sign language, skills acquisition, medical outreach, among others. Akpama took the participants through creating their personal blogs and how to make legitimate money online, cautioning them not to engage in Internet fraud, ritual killings and other negative vices. The convener, Owoyemi Emmanuel, said this project was meant to put smiles in the faces of the youths in the environment. Emmanuel said government cannot do everything for her citizens, religious organisations, foundations and corporate bodies should sometimes step in to support and complement their efforts. “We have also built schools in community where the children are out- of –school,” he stressed. To the Chief Executive Officer, Creatoms Concept, Tofunmi Idowu, who trained the youths on graphics, logo designs, flyers, business cards, video editing, white-board animation and 3D  urged them to carve a nitch for themselves by taking their businesses to another level. Idowu observed that most small scale businesses don’t have an online presence, which she said was not good enough, especially now that businesses are moving to the online space. Convener, Speaking Fingers Network, Treasure Uchegbu said partnering with group to educate and enlighten the people in the religious and public settings would go a long way to douse tensions in the various communities in the country.
