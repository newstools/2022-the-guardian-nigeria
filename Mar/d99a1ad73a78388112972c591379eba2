President of the African Development Bank Group, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, will open the Africa Investment Forum (AIF) virtual boardroom sessions scheduled to hold from March 15 to 17 to showcase exceptional bankable projects. A statement by the bank said the event would showcase more than $50 billion of curated bankable projects to investors. The sessions were to have been held during the Africa Investment Forum Market Days Event in November 2021, which was postponed due to the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 outbreak. The boardrooms will feature projects in key priority sectors identified in the AIF’s 2020 Unified Response to COVID-19 initiative. The sectors include agriculture and agro-processing, education, energy and climate, healthcare, minerals and mining, information and communications technology, telecommunication, industrialization and trade. The statement said nine of these projects are women-led with a potential value of $5 billion. Adesina is to open the virtual meetings on 15 March. He will also make a closing presentation and an announcement on 17 March. A media session will follow with the heads of the AIF founding partner institutions. Launched in 2018, the Africa Investment Forum is a multi-disciplinary platform that advances private and public-private partnership (PPP) projects to bankability. It also raises capital and accelerates deals to financial closure. AIF is an initiative of the African Development Bank in partnership with Africa 50, Africa Finance Corporation, African Export-Import Bank, Development Bank of Southern Africa, Trade and Development Bank; European Investment Bank and the Islamic Development Bank as founding partners.
