The Association of Certified Chartered Accountants (ACCA), as a global brand, will continue to maintain its stand on zero tolerance for corruption in work places to protect accounting records of organisations in public and private sectors where members hold sway. ACCA Country Head in Nigeria, Tom Isibor, disclosed this at the 2022 ACCA Nigeria summit held in Abuja. Isibor said: “It is our duty to ensure accounting records are accurately kept and published with the aim of discouraging any form of fraudulent practices that can pull down corporate and government entities. It is also about protecting our ethics and values in line with world accounting standards. “Although we are yet to record any member found wanting in relation to corrupt practices here in Nigeria, I am quite convinced that if cases of fraud or corruption practices against any member are brought to us, such member may be sanctioned and his certificate withdrawn after thorough investigation.” Isibor said that ACCA professionals are different from other known accounting bodies because of its contents, qualification, dynamic experiences, as well as being a global brand. According to him, the 2022 ACCA Nigeria Summit in Abuja was designed to develop core competencies and create a pipeline of progressive ACCA students based on the professional insights. Also contributing, ACCA Deputy President/Chief Executive Officer, Rubicola Consulting, Joseph Owolabi, stressed that the programme objective includes, to determine the value of ACCA’s insights and practice its recommendations in developing future—ready professionals, to increase value delivery to employers by improving their employer’s capacity to contribute to the sustainability of the organisation’s operations as well as to create a pipeline of ACCA future members with ability and capacity to progress through the qualification leveraging organizational support among others. Speaking on the topic, ‘’Building Capacity for the 4th Revolution’’, Chief Talent Officer, Y F Talent Partners, Yemi Faseun, said it was gladdening that over 500,000 members drawn from the public and private organizations are attending the programme in Abuja.
