The village head (Baale) of Olowe Gbagura in Abeokuta North Local Council of Ogun State, Chief Akin Muheedeen, has been burnt to death by yet-to-be-identified persons.
    
Muheedeen was murdered barely a month after the Olu of Agodo, Oba Ayinde Odetola, was killed and burnt to death in Ewekoro Local Council of the state.  “He used to pray every morning, so he went out at about 6:00 a.m. to urinate and prepare for prayer. After about 15 minutes, I heard my senior wife shouting, ‘fire, fire’. I rushed out to discover that it was Baale that was on fire. He didn’t go out with fire or matches. We don’t know who did this,” Iyabode explained.
