The federal government is duty-bound to unravel the whereabouts of the missing five engineers handling the rehabilitation of the Ring Road in Ebonyi State as consultants of the $150 million African Development Bank (AfDB) project. To be modest, the heart is bleeding on the presumption of their deaths having been missing since 3rd November, 2021. These hardworking professionals, who went for a legitimate job for economic growth of the state, cannot end their lives in such a tragic manner. Reports from diverse quarters accused the state government of being hostile to the consultants prior to their abduction for reasons best known to the actors. Nigeria is not an abattoir where animals are recklessly killed without explanations.
 
Section 14(b) of the 1999 Constitution, Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended protects all citizens from brutality. It provides “…the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government”. These consultants namely: Engr. Nelson Onyemeh (lead consultant/ Chief Executive Officer of NELAN Engineering Ltd) from Ihiala in Anambra State; Engr. Ernest Edeani from Nkanu in Enugu State; Ikechukwu Ejiofor from Umunya in Oyi LGA of Anambra State; Engr. Samuel Aneke from Nkanu in Enugu-East LGA of Enugu State and Engr. Stanley Nwazulum from Amawbia in Awka-South LGA of Anambra State; all from the South-East as citizens are supposedly protected by this provision.
