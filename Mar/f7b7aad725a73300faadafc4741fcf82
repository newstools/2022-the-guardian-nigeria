Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s politics of peace and inclusion in Enugu State would face severe test as the build up to the 2023 general elections gathers steam.
 
Ever since he emerged as governor after three terms in the House of Representatives, some members of the Senate from Enugu State felt that he jumped the queue and ought not be governor before them. That could be why Senator Ayogu Eze, former chairman of Senate Committee on Works, decided to cross over to All Progressives Congress (APC) and contested the 2019 governorship against the incumbent.  MEANWHILE, the opposition APC, which recently elected the former Director General of Chimaroke Nnamani’s governorship campaign, Chief Ugochukwu Agballah, as state chairman is waiting on the wings for a possible slip by PDP.
   
Immediate past state chairman of the party, Dr. Ben Nwoye, told journalists in Enugu that the infighting within PDP could pave the way for APC to clinch the governorship.
