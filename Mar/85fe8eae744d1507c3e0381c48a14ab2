The Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige, has commiserated with the Trade Union Congress (TUC) over the death of its Secretary General, Musa-Lawal Ozigi and Kwara State Chairman, Akinsola Akinwunmi, who were killed in the Kaduna train terror attack. Ngige said this in a condolence letter addressed to the leadership of the TUC and made available to newsmen by his Media Office on Wednesday in Abuja. He described the death of Ozigi and Akinwunmi as huge loss to Nigeria’s tripartite community. The minister also described the late Ozigi as “a dogged and consummate labour leader.” He noted that the Secretary General tragic death at the unfortunate Kaduna rail terror attack “is a devastating blow at a time Nigeria’s tripartite is ever united in finding solutions to the bestriding challenges in the world of work, nay the nation at large. “We shall all miss his contributions. Ozigi’s self-effacing personality often belied his depth of thought and ideas. “His seminal contributions to discussions on labour issues no doubt earned him a place in over two decades of service to unionism starting from the Construction and Civil Engineering Senior Staff Association where he was Secretary General to joining the Congress in 2012.” The minister prayed for the repose of the souls of the deceased, while he further prayed for God’s blessings on the families they left behind.
