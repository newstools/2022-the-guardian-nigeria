Although the director has been slammed by fans of the short series for using the term “Unknown people” to describe the cast. In reaction to his comment one fan wrote “LOL just some of the most famous actors in Korea,” Spielberg, in a recent interview, talked about the changing times and importance of an actor’s role in a film. “A long time ago it was domestic stars that brought the audience into movies. Today, it’s interesting, unknown people can star entire miniseries, can be in movies…Squid Game comes along and changes the math entirely for all of us”. Squid Game aired in 2021 and has shaped the raving insight into Korean films and actors. Squid Game season two is expected to come back in 2023.
