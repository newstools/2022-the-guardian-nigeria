It could be throwing away a shirt or replacing an old and torn gown. Most of the time, when making these decisions about our wardrobes, we tend to focus more on clothes, ignoring footwears. It’s no secret that the first time you meet someone, after the face, your eyes sometimes dart to the person’s feet. So, in a way, first impressions can be built off what a person wears on his/her feet. Footwear is important in your journey as a future trendsetter, which is why you must own good and stylish pairs. And what better footwear screams those words than a gorgeous pair of boots.   While sandals, slippers, and shoes are good footwear to pair with your outfit, the boot has proven over the years to be the best. Boots have this unique ability to elevate your style game, taking it to the next level. Just ask the numerous fashion designers who incorporate boots into their runway collections. They will testify to how amazing it is. Still not convinced about getting a boot? In this article, we listed five reasons why you should get a boot. Comfort Nothing is sadder than seeing a beautifully dressed woman walking uncomfortably while wearing a shoe. Wearing a boot feels like an extension of your foot, so it’s easier to get used to and not experience crucial pain compared to a shoe. A Chelsea boot, a bootie, and an ankle boot are examples of boots that accurately describe comfort. Trendy and chic Believe us when we say boots are a timeless trend that will make you stand out from the crowd. Since their debut, boots have not only graced the runways but also inspired fashion houses and become the go-to footwear for many celebrities. Also, “chic” can be described as a synonym for “boots”. Imagine you wearing an oversized shirt with a black leather knee-length boot. Now, that’s serving both chic and fashion icon vibes. Versatile Boots are not your average shoe; they come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colours. With designs from fashion brands like Moschino, we have seen the evolution of the boot into becoming what one might call a medium of artistic expression. Another way to explain boot’s versatility would be its ability to suit any occasion, complementing any outfit. Boots can also transform a formal outfit into a casual one, and vice versa. Confidence Have you ever walked into a room and it seemed like you owned the place? If this hasn’t happened to you, then you probably haven’t worn a pair of boots. They are like confidence boosters, launching you into a space of mind where you feel like you are the boss and can be anything you want to be. Durable There is a reason you visit your shoemaker every time for repairs; it’s a sign for you to get a pair of boots. A watchword for boots, especially leather ones, is durability. So, are you looking for footwear that can last you for several years or can be used by future generations? The boot is one clothing store away. As they say during a debate session, with these few points of ours, we hope we have been able to convince you and not to confuse you on why you should get a pair of boots.
