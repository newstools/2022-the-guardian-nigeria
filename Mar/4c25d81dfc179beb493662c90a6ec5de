A mother of two simply known as Tina Idoroyen, has allegedly put her five-year-old daughter’s hands in hot water for stealing her fish.
  
The survivor lives with Idoroyen, her biological mother and elder sister at N02, Gregory Street, Ikot Ansa community in Calabar Municipal Local Council of Cross River State.  “Meanwhile, she admitted that when it happened, the child had not eaten, which means she must have been hungry.
 
“The woman has nothing, the father of the child abandoned them two years ago and she still has another eight-year-old daughter. “They can barely feed and she is owing house rent, so if we had not intervened with treatment immediately, that child’s burns would have been badly infected.”  “She needs to pay for her crime, but we have not taken that decision yet, because it will not be proper to do that now.
