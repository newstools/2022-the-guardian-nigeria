The Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of Osun State University (UNIOSUN), Yusuf Ali, has decried the exclusion of state universities from negotiations between the striking members of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government, adding that strike should not be forced on workers who are unwilling to join. He said the crisis in the nation’s universities would end when each institution has an opportunity to negotiate wages with its workers. Ali spoke in Osogbo, while briefing newsmen on the sixth biennial conference of the Committee of Pro-Chancellors of State-owned Universities in Nigeria, billed to hold from March 21-25, 2022 at the Osun State University, Osogbo. The legal luminary, who is also chairman of the committee, said: “Our organisation has not been involved in it. That is part of the problem. How could you negotiate things with people and then you want to force your agreement on people who were not parties? In other countries, each university sits down and negotiates with the workers. I hope we get there soon. Once we get to that place, there will be no more crisis.” Meanwhile, the Osun State governor and Visitor to UNIOSUN, Adegboyega Oyetola, would declare the conference open, while the opening session would be chaired by Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi. Also, during the conference, Registrar/Chief Executive, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, would present the keynote address on the theme: ‘State Ownership Dynamics, University Councils and The Need For a New Social Contract Between Society and University.’
