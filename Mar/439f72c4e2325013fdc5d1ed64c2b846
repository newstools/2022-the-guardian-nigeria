The Ogun State government has advised all taxable adults resident in the state, whose sources of income were not subjected to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) to file in their annual returns of income from all sources for year ended December 31, 2021, before March 31, to avoid penalty. The advise was contained in a statement, yesterday, signed by the Executive Chairman of Ogun State Internal Revenue Service (OGIRS), Mr. Olugbenga Olaleye, where he quoted Section 41 of the Personal Income Tax Act as amended, stating that “all taxable persons resident in Ogun State were required to file annual returns of all incomes from all sources for the year ended December 31, 2021, within 90 days from the January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2022 using Income Declaration Form called Form A.” While pointing out that defaulters who fail to file or declare falsely or do not file at all would be penalised according to Sections 94, 95 and 96 of the Tax Act, he urged those concerned to visit the agency’s portal, portal.ogetax.ogunstate.gov.ng to file the annual returns from the comfort of their homes and offices.
