Nigeria’s House of Representatives Tuesday said it will reconsider three women-related bills voted down last week during the voting for amendments made to the 1999 Constitution. The bills on citizenship for foreigners married to Nigerian women, indigeneship for Nigerian women married to men from states other than theirs and 35% affirmative action for women failed to get the mandatory two-thirds votes to pass during voting at the National Assembly dominated by male members. The outcome of the voting on the bills was immediately greeted by condemnations and protests by women. House of Reps said in a statement that the bills, on the instruction of Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila,  were re-committed to the Committee of the Whole for consideration on Tuesday.
