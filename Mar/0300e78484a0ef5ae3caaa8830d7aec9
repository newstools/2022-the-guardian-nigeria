 Wendy Williams | Photo – Astrid Stawiarz-Getty Images Wendy Williams has called out Wells Fargo and Lori Schiller for not allowing her to have access to her millions. The Tv host revealed this in a video she shared on Instagram on Wednesday. In the video, Williams solicited that her money is made accessible to her. Williams alleged that the bank locked her out of ‘her’ based on the assertions of ‘her’ being “incapacitated” therefore under guardianship.   Wells Fargo has made declarations in a letter documented in court stating that the bank “has strong reason to believe that [Williams] is the victim of undue influence and financial exploitation.” According to the bank, Williams is “an established client of Wells Fargo and, notably, 15 years with the particular financial advisor” describing Fargo as “a 23-year veteran of the financial services industry with an unblemished record.” The 57-year-old TV personality didn’t leave behind her former manager  Bernie Young. She alleges that Young obtained her American Express card and used it to hire an attorney that documented a petition against her. “I know for a fact that Bernie Young used my American Express card to hire an attorney to file a petition against me. That was done with my American Express card,” she alleged. Following that Wendy Williams has filed a case on the issue the same way the lawyers of the bank filed out their case. However, representatives of Wells Fargo have refuted the claims of Wendy Williams.
