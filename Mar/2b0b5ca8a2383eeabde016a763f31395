Human Right lawyer, Chief Malcolm Omirhobo, has sued the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, and two others at the Federal High Court, Lagos, over approval of Hijab as part of the official dress code for Nigerian female police officers.
 
Joined in the suit are Nigeria government and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami.
In an orginating summon, Omirhobo asked whether by the true combined interpretation and/or construction of Sections 1(1)(3), 10, 214 of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, it is proper, legal, lawful and constitutional for the 1st defendant (Baba) with the tacit support of the 2nd defendant (Nigeria government) and 3rd defendant (Malami), to use public funds to approve, produce, issue and distribute to Nigerian female police officers throughout Nigeria Hijab for use as part of their official dress code while on duty?
 
He also asked the court if the defendants approval of Hijab as part of the official dress code for female police officers does not amount to adoption of Islam as State religion in Nigeria, and therefore, a flagrant violation of Sections 1(1)(3), 10, 214 of the 1999 Constitution.
