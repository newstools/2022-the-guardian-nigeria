Lagos State Government Saturday sealed the premises of an event centre where petrol was shared as souvenirs. Officials of the Lagos Safety Commission and the Rapid Response Squad sealed Havillah Event Centre, Oniru, for contravening public safety rules for allowing sharing of the petroleum product in jerrycans. The senior special assistant (SSA) to the Governor of Lagos State on New Media, Jubril Gawat, said the Lagos State police commissioner has ordered the arrest of those involved. “There is no doubt that this action is dangerous and can lead to loss of lives and property,” Lagos State commissioner for information Gbenga Omotoso said in a statement earlier on Saturday. Omotoso said sharing petrol as a souvenir is blatantly against all safety measures in such places. “The Lagos State Government, through the Safety Commission, is investigating this matter and will ensure that all parties to this reprehensible action are made to account for it. “The safety of lives and property of Lagosians and visitors remains a top priority to the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration. We, therefore, advise that actions that can lead to loss of lives and property be avoided.”
