A youth group, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), has expressed concern over reports alleging that the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is being tortured in the Department of the State Service (DSS) custody. In a statement issued yesterday by its President General, Goodluck Ibem, the group said that if Kanu was being tortured, officials of DSS should stop such action immediately to avoid tension in the country. Ibem recalled the tensed situation in the South East due to Kanu’s detention and trial and cautioned against further torture of Kanu and inhuman treatment of the Igbo people in the country, which he said, could lead to heightened unrest. The group said the current volatile situation in the South East should tell that all is not well, stressing: “The South East zone is highly tensed up and any act on the part of the DSS to further heighten or increase the already violatile security situation in the zone will not argur well for the country. “Torturing Kanu is counter-productive and will lead the country to serious security challenges if not stopped immediately.” “Federal Government’s continued detention of Kanu has not yielded any economic, political or material benefit to Nigeria, but rather, it has pushed the Nigerian economy into harder straits and if not addressed speedily, will drive the Nigerian economy into depression,” the statement added.
