• CAF approves full capacity in Kumasi Stadium
 • Match live on StarTimes’ NTA channel Nigerians fans going to Ghana for today’s World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars must brace up for some hard times at the Togo/Ghana border in Aflao. The border was closed to foreigners in the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, and so, the only option for visitors to the country is to fly into Accra, where they are expected to go through some health protocols. A Ghanaian journalist, Daniel Yeboah, told The Guardian that President Nana Akufo-Addo has promised to reopen the borders in two weeks time. But before then, Nigerian football fans can only enter the country if Immigration and Customs officials permit them; and that is only made possible through bribing the officials. However, Nigerians at home can watch the game StarTimes’ NTA channels. Meanwhile, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has approved Ghana’s request to admit 40,000 spectators for the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 play-off first leg match against Nigeria at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi.
 
This comes after the Ghana Football Association request to play the game in full capacity stadium following the laid-down rules by CAF. The GFA has, consequently, advised all fans to obey all laid-down safety and security measures strictly to first and foremost have a successful match and also to avoid any sanctions from CAF and FIFA.
  
The play-off match between Black Stars and Super Eagles will kick off at 8.30 p.m. Nigerian time, which is 7.30 p.m. in Ghana.
