Egyptian national carrier, EgyptAir, has widened its operations in Nigeria with new partnership and opening of ticketing offices in Lagos and Ibadan. The expansion is in reaction to the growing number of Nigerian travellers visiting the country and transiting on the carrier.
EgyptAir Country Manager, Muharram Abdel Rahman, at the launch of a partnership with Wakanow, said the new offices aim to give customers easy access to services by leveraging the strength of partners. “This partnership will see EgyptAir open City Ticketing Offices through the Wakanow Travel Centre network across Nigeria, enabling our plans to expand our operations further into the Northern and Southern parts. “EgyptAir was established in 1932 as the first airline in Africa and the Middle East and the seventh in the world. The airline also has a rich history in Nigeria being only the second airline to land in the country. We are proud to be an African airline and we have been serving Nigeria now for more than 56 years,” Rahman said. Expressing his excitement, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Wakanow, Adebayo Adedeji, said the partnership is a boost for the service providers and a win-win for all. “Our technological knowhow and our footprint will help EgyptAir serve its customers. For us, this is not a game changer; this is the game. The game for us is innovation. We are not competing because innovation does not need competition. “Innovation is driven by thinking about the customer and taking care of them and EgyptAir is willing to take care of the customer. Wakanow is the only Travel Agency in Nigeria that can facilitate visa on arrival to Cairo through our partnership with EgyptAir and Karnak. We are doing this for the customer because we believe that when we take care of the customer the customer will end up taking care of us,” Adedeji said.
