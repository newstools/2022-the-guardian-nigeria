Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger State have expressed support for Governor Abubakar Bello in his recent appointment as acting National Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party. Respondents in Minna and other parts of the state described the governor’s national assignment as a credit to the state. Noting that APC, with membership across the globe, is a party to reckon with, they stressed that Bello’s leadership would re-unite the party members, especially the aggrieved. The Guardian gathered that some members of the party at the local council level, who were shortchanged during the state congresses, received the news of Bello’s appointment with enthusiasm. APC chairman in Niger, Haliru Jikantoro, said the state exco was overwhelmed with Bello’s appointment. “You can see smiles not only in our faces, but deep inside us. We are pleased with the APC for appointing Governor Bello to pilot its affairs. Bello is a complete gentleman with great wisdom. He is well positioned to fine-tune APC,” Jikantoro said. APC chieftain and Commissioner for Local Government, Chieftaincy Affairs and Internal Security in Niger, Emmanuel Umar, maintained that Bello’s appointment came at a time the party was nursing the new handlers at all levels, and needed leaders that would carry every member along as one family. “We are ready to work tirelessly to re-brand the party that will be accepted by all,” Umar said. In his submission, Commissioner for Works and Infrastructural Development, Mamman Musa, congratulated APC members at all levels for having Bello at the helm of affairs at the national level. “Believed me, very soon, we will start receiving returnees in their numbers. Since Bello’s appointment as national leader of APC, we have started breathing the fresh air of better days,” Musa said.
