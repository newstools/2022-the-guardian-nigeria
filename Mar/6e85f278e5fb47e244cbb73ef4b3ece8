With the inauguration of Senator Lekan Balogun as the 42 Olubadan of Ibadan land today, Friday March 11, 2022, political observers across Oyo State believe that Governor Seyi Makinde, has successfully taken another step closer to achieving a second term in office, come 2023.
 
There is some assurance that if at all Makinde will confront any opposition, it is definitely not going to come from the traditional institution of Ibadan land.
 
Immediately the 41 Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji, died on January 2 2022, there was apprehension that the appointment of Adetuji’s successor might create serious problems for Makinde, considering the crisis that the elevation of Ibadan High Chiefs to the position of beaded crown-wearing king by former Governor Abiola Ajimobi, generated.
 
Observers believed that the repercussions of Ajimobi’s decision in tampering with the traditional institutional arrangements of Ibadan was part of the factors that caused the erstwhile ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Oyo State in the 2019 governorship election.  Lana recalled that the right given to the chiefs to wear beaded crowns and coronets was challenged by High Chief Rashidi Ladoja, upon which the court nullified the said conferment.
