When you go to the market and meet a seller who is unwilling to reduce the price of a product, just walk away. By the time you take three steps, he/she will call you back and agree to your price. Compare prices The golden rule for market shopping: never settle for the first price. In the same way, you probably won’t marry the first person you date, you should not buy a product from the first shop you see. Unless the product has a generally fixed price, walk around the market and compare the prices each seller charges for the product. Discount for the first time A major requirement for this product is that you have a sweet mouth. If you are buying from a seller for the first time, try to persuade him/her to sell it to you at a cheaper price, so you can buy from him another day. And you can take it a little further by promising to recommend his/her shop to your friends. Bulk buying There is a reason our mothers buy foodstuffs in large quantities. It’s no secret that the more products you buy, the cheaper the price. For example, if you see a product being sold for ₦500, you could bargain with the seller that if you buy two, you only get to pay ₦800. Be firm Desperate times call for desperate measures. Sometimes, you don’t need to wear a big smile or have a calm attitude when approaching a seller. The secret is that some sellers get intimidated by people who look or act angry; this scares them from charging a high price for a product. Pretend to be a reseller It’s not lying if you are getting a cheap deal. All you have to do is tell the seller you hope to re-sell the product, so he/she will have no choice but to sell it to you at a wholesale price. Tone down your dressing We don’t know who needs to hear this, but please and please, try not to overdress when going to the market. And by overdress, we mean avoid dressing like someone who has money. If it’s possible, opt for faded or somewhat torn clothes. Now that we have given you the secret to buying more with less money, go out into the market and show them what you’ve got.
