Osun State Governor Gboyega Oyetola has urged the electorate to safeguard their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) ahead of the July 16 governorship election in the state. Oyetola made the appeal yesterday during an engagement programme with Nigeria Professional Photographers and Videographers Association in Osogbo. The governor, represented by his Special Adviser on Civic Engagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, appealed to the electorate not to allow any individual to deceive them with ‘fake promises’ to steal their PVCs from them. Oyetola, who noted that the strength of the electorate is their PVCs, urged them to jealously guard them and desist from selling to desperate politicians. He also urged those who are yet to obtain their PVCs to take advantage of the ongoing continuous voters registration and get theirs.
