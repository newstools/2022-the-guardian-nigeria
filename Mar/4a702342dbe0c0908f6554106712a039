• To launch ‘Operation Safe Conduct’ ahead of elections
• Seeks The Guardian support on activities Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya, has warned senior officers and field commanders to desist from partisan politics and work towards ensuring a violence-free 2023 election. Yahaya gave the warning at the COAS conference held at Command Officers’ Mess, Asokoro, Abuja. He commanded troops for their efforts in all theatres of operations. He also lauded synergy with the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies, promising it would be sustained. He said: “As we carry out our constitutional duties of maintaining peace and security, in aid of civil authority across the country, let me emphasise that we should all remain professional and glaringly apolitical. “We should also continue to uphold human rights principles in the conduct of our operations, in tandem with the Constitution and our Rules of Engagement. This is particularly important as the activities outlined in the Independent National Electoral Commission’s calendar gathers steam.” He added: “In line with our constitutional responsibilities, we will continue to provide favorable and secure environment for the conduct of the general elections through Operation Safe Conduct, in aid to civil authority.” THIS was as Director of Defense Information (DDI), Major General Jimmy Akpor, solicited collaboration with The Guardian to boost factual propagation of military activities across the country. Akpor made the appeal during a courtesy visit to the Abuja bureau of the newspaper, yesterday. He said: “Ours is kinetics. But things that are sowed in the mind cannot be displayed with kinetics. The media governs that space. We could be doing so much. But if public perception does not suggest that, it would leave those in the field demoralised, if their efforts are not projected. So, you have a sacred role to play.”
