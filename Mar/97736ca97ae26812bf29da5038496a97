Kylian Mbappe was passed fit to start for Paris Saint-Germain against Real Madrid in the second leg of the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday. PSG was given a scare when Mbappe picked up a knock in training on Monday but PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino had indicated the striker would recover and so it proved. Mbappe took his place in PSG’s front three alongside Neymar and Lionel Messi, the Argentinian returning to the Santiago Bernabeu for the first time since leaving Barcelona last summer. There were no surprises in the Real Madrid line-up as Toni Kroos shook off a hamstring strain to start while Fede Valverde replaced the suspended Casemiro in midfield, chosen ahead of Eduardo Camavinga.
