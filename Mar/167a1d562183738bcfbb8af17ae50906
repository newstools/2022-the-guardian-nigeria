Lead Visioner of Lagos4Lagos, Dr. Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran, popularly known as ‘Jandor,’ yesterday said that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would supplant the All Progressives Congress (APC)  come 2023. Adediran, who stated this during his official declaration to contest the governorship election under the platform of PDP in Lagos State, said the PDP’s performance in Lagos had been between 30 and 34 per cent every election year, and it is time for the party to cross the threshold. He said the APC is in a deficit with the massive crowd of the Lagos4Lagos members that have decamped to the PDP, saying that it’s a gain for the PDP. Meanwhile, Dr. Jonathan Nnaji, representing the Ndigbo in Lagos4Lagos Movement, expressed support to Jandor 2023 vision.
