In Cryptocurrency, each individual has a fair chance of actualising their potential to make profits or experience financial losses. Like any other investment, making money requires careful consideration, so it is critical to always conduct your own research. This includes analysing which coins will lead you to your own financial success, potentially turning you into a Crypto-millionaire. Here are three coins you might want to place your faith in: Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and especially Seesaw Protocol (SSW). <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1691884 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def.jpg" alt="" width="904" height="752" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def.jpg 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def-719x598.jpg 719w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def-289x240.jpg 289w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def-577x480.jpg 577w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Future-is-Def-600x499.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" />  As philosopher Alan Watts stated, money is a way of measuring wealth but is not wealth in itself. Therefore, when its utility is replaced by something more efficient, traditional forms of currency will be a chapter in the past. In the same way we transitioned from horses to cars for transportation, is the same way in which Decentralised Finance (DeFi) will take over the current centralised medium of exchange. Overall, Crypto allows all individuals to have actual ownership of their money in an easy, permissionless, and transparent way. A notable coin to consider is Ripple (XRP). XRP is an open-source, permissionless and decentralised blockchain technology that has the ability to settle transactions in 3-5 seconds. When compared to other coins such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP) is much faster and has lower transaction costs. In summary, XRP is a Cryptocurrency designed for business use that seeks to be a quick and cost-effective way to send money across borders. In the past week, the price of XRP has risen by 8.69%, and there’s a considerable probability that market makers will drive the XRP price higher because of buy-stop liquidity above $0.85 and $0.91. So it’s evident that its price in value will continue to increase.  Moving on, Solana (SOL) is another Crypto worth investing in. Having officially launched in March 2020, it managed to triple its price in value by the summer of 2021. Solana’s (SOL) tokens remain the most staked asset, with nearly $40 billion worth of SOL staked across many protocols, and stakers receive a 5.86% annual yield. Overall, it has traded between $11.90 and $260.06 over the last 52 weeks.  Last but not least, the coin that deserves your utmost attention is Seesaw Protocol (SSW). SSW is a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that can be used on any blockchain with smart contracts. Users will be able to move data between the Ethereum (ETH), Binance and Polygon (MATIC) blockchains. Holders will be able to move freely between the three networks in order to select the most efficient and cost-effective network for their transactions. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1691887 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2.png" alt="" width="904" height="628" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2.png 904w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2-861x598.jpg 861w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2-320x222.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2-640x445.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-future-is-def-2-600x417.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /> Regarding growth, the price of Seesaw Protocol (SSW) surged by approximately 2000%. Thus, showing tremendous progress despite being in pre-sale. In addition, it is expected that the price of SSW’s value will surpass a whopping 7000% from now until Phase 3, which ends in April this year (as shown in the image above).  Furthermore, what makes the Seesaw Protocol (SSW) special is that it aims to have a positive financial impact as well as a positive humanitarian impact – to better society as a whole. For instance, the SSW will transfer 1% of its Marketing pot to an Education pot, which will be used to fund educational institutions around the world, particularly in developing countries, to pay for the resources needed to deliver the education required. This clearly demonstrates that this rising coin is truly one of a kind.  Referring back to its potential growth, it’s significant to note that SSW attained a phenomenal increase in value of 32% in the past week of pre-sale alone and a 2000% increase in just over a month. Moreover, it’s necessary to acknowledge that experts predict that Seesaw Protocol (SSW) will have increased from $0.11 to $0.40-0.45 by the end of pre-sale Phase 3! So, the time is now – purchase SSW tokens and enjoy its continuous growth through presale.  Clearly, it is valid for one to believe that the Seesaw Protocol (SSW) has illustrated consistent and significant growth. Thus, investing now within pre-sale Phase 2 is the perfect opportunity for you to get closer to achieving financial success as there is still a massive expansion yet to follow.  To conclude, the Crypto metaverse will continue to expand in a way that our minds may not even be able to comprehend fully. Who knows precisely what it will look like… Hence, the safest option to achieve financial security is to invest in reliable coins that will appreciate in time – the earlier you invest, the more significant your gains will be. Overall, DeFi is gaining traction due to its nature of being transparent and permissionless. The value of DeFi assets surpassed $180 billion this year, and this trend is expected to continue in 2022. It’s evident that our future will revolve around DeFi as Crypto shows us that it’s possible to create your own financial success. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that now is the best time to invest in the goldmine Seesaw Protocol (SSW) as the price can only go up from here. This rising coin stands as a solid example of exponential growth that will cause TradFi systems to tremble.
