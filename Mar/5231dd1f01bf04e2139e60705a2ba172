Meanwhile, the Vice President of Highcap Securities Limited, David Adonri has stated that the fundamentals of the Nigerian capital market will succumb to the disruptions inflicted on the global economy by the brutal invasion of Ukraine by Russians in the near future. Adonri, while reacting to the closure of the Moscow stock exchange yesterday, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered massive sanctions from several other countries that have sent the ruble plummeting to record lows against the dollar, stated that the disruption in the global economy would impact negatively on the stock market soon, in addition to the heightened political risk arising from buildup to 2023 general election. He said that though Nigeria will benefit from the attendant rise in crude oil price, the gains are likely to be lost to the imported inflation due to import dependence. The unprovoked, barbaric and tyrannical invasion of Ukraine by Putin, is a big threat to the stability of the global economy. So far, global Capital Markets have declined considerably in reaction to the devilish onslaught by the Russian vampire. Even the Russian Capital Market narrowly escaped collapse just after the invasion. “It is not surprising that the Russian Stock Exchange was closed down today in order to save the market from irretrievable damage. Even the Russian currency is at the verge of collapse due to repercussions of the war. Commodity prices are also escalating, exacerbating the already heightened global inflation rate. “ Trading activities at the Moscow stock exchange remained closed down yesterday, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which triggered massive sanctions from several other countries that have sent the ruble plummeting to record lows against the dollar. Specifically, the ruble fell about 30% against the dollar yesterday, making it worth less than 1 U.S. cent.
