The national executive committee (NEC) meeting of the ruling All Progressives Congress scheduled for Thursday would no longer hold. The secretary of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning, Senator John Akpanudoedehe, made this known in a statement. “As directed by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, H.E. Mai Mala Buni, a purported emergency meeting of the  Party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) slated for Thursday, March 26, 2022, is hereby cancelled,” Akpanudoedehe said. The party’s position came barely less than two hours after President Muhammadu Buhari threw his weight behind Mai Mala Buni as chairman of the caretaker committee.
