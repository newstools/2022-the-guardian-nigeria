Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency (DSVA) in collaboration with Centre for Women’s Health and Information, Yaba, has commenced advocacy and sensitisation programme on domestic and sexual violence throughout the 20 Local Councils of the state.
   
Already,  four councils have been covered in line with  Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s directive, following increasing cases of domestic and sexual violence in the state.
     
Speaking during a sensitisation programme at Oshodi-Isolo Local Council, Executive Secretary of the agency, Mrs. Titilayo Vivour-Adeniyi, said the event was aimed at sensitising residents about sexual and gender-based violence and offering support services to victims with a view to reducing  the rise in violence and defilement.  According to her,  it is  in the communities  that a  whole lot of things happen, so we need to engage them to create focal points within  the councils and Local council Development Areas ( LCDAs).
 
A survivor of domestic violence, Mrs. Maria Sanusi advised that women should speak out and those who have friends and relations, who are abused or molested should not be mocked, but put a call to the agency to counsel them because most women suffer emotions, low self-esteem and high blood pressure.
