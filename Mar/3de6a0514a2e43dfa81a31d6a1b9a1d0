Announcing the news on Instagram, the TV sho’s official shared an image of the film with the caption”Feeling YOU-4-ic. YOU Season 4 is now in production,” the caption read. The post now has over seven thousand celebratory comments. Back in October 2021, Netflix announced the show’s season 4 renewal ahead of the highly anticipated third season. Based on Caroline Kepnes’ best-selling novels, You has starred Penn Badgley since its 2018 inception and Victoria Pedretti in seasons 2 and 3. “It’s been thrilling to watch Penn bring Joe to creepy yet compelling life,” showrunner Sera Gamble said in a statement. “We’re deeply grateful that Netflix has shown You such monumental support and that people around the world have enjoyed watching Joe really get it all very wrong over the past 3 seasons.” “The whole You team is excited to explore new, dark facets of love in season 4,” Gamble added. In Season 3 of the series, viewers followed Joe and Love as a married couple raising their son in a Northern Carlifornia suburb. While the plot of season 4 remains under wraps, Netflix announced that announced that Euphoria and The White Lotus star Lukas Gage would be joining the cast of the fourth season. “Lukas Gage is coming for You,” they teased, alongside a split image of Gage, 26, and Badgley. “In @YouNetflix season 4, Gage plays Adam, the warm, funny, and hard-partying son of a wealthy family who is famous for failing to meet their standards,” Netflix wrote. The company added sinisterly, “But the one thing he did learn from his parents is to do whatever it takes to get what you want.” [as unit=2]
