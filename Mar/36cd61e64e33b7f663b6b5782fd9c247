Residents and people of Ibereko in Badagry Local Council of Lagos State have expressed gladness over the spate of work on the Lagos-Badagry Expressway.
    
Speaking on behalf of the community, Oba Israel Okoya, the Onibereko of Ibereko land, said in the past, residents spent between five and six hours from Badagry to Mile 2 on traffic because of the deplorable state of the road.
  
Oba Okoya, who spoke during inspection of the section three of the project, which spans from Agbara to Seme Border being supervised by the Federal Ministry of Works, expressed gladness with the progress of work and called for continuation of the project.
 
He said: “But today, we thank the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister for Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola for tremendous changes we have seen on the road.  “We are here to see the progress that has been made so far on this road.       This road is very sensitive to the Federal Government. “Out of the 21 critical roads under NNPC funding we have two in the South West and Lagos-Badagry Expressway happens to be one,” he added.
