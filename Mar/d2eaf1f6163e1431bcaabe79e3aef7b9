Sir: “Nigeria’s next President must be a southerner and Christian, because the Northerners and Muslim would have served their terms of eight years out in 2023 through General Muhammadu Buhari.” The statement in quote was made by one Chief Adesunbo Onitiri in an article written with the above title, in Nigerian Tribune Newspaper on February 14, 2022.
 
“We cannot run away from religion being a key factor in our political structure,” said the writer. However, I want you to understand that it’s the same religion, as a factor, that puts the nation at its current predicaments.
 
Sadly enough, I found it very incredible to have people still believing that religion is a factor of consideration in Nigerian politics considering the nation’s situation – at this juncture of unprecedented insecurity, tribalism, ethnicity, communal clashes, nepotism, smuggling, trafficking, among other challenges facing the country. It’s too unbelievable for me.
