Super Eagles’ Striker, Victor Osimhen’s star has continued to rise. The 2015 U-17 World Cup winner, who moved from Lille of France to Italy’s Napoli for €75 million, has been earmarked by English giants, Manchester United, as the likely solution to their goal scoring problems, and therefore, a target for the summer transfer window. According to reports from Italy, the Manchester United have inquired about Osimhen with a view to getting him to replace Anthony Martial, who is currently on loan to Sevilla. To avoid any vacuum should Osimhen eventually join Manchester United, Napoli have already started sounding out potential replacements for the Nigerian, with Sassuolo’s Gianluca Scamacca their preferred replacement. Scamacca is also a target of Italian champions, Inter Milan, according to reports. The Sassuolo hitman also prefers a move to Inter. Napoli, according to cultofcalcio.com, want to keep Osimhen for another season in their bid to win the Italian Serie A and it would take a fee of €100 million to lure the Nigerian away from Naples. Manchester United, two seasons ago, bidded for Osimhen when they had a strikers’ crisis, but the former Wolfsburg star rejected the overtures in deference to Odion Ighalo, who was then on loan at Old Trafford. Raif Ragnick wants to change his attack, which currently has Edinson Cavani and Cristiano Ronaldo, who are over 34 years old. According to Rai Sport, Manchester United will try to sign an elite striker in the summer, and Osimhen is second on their shortlist behind Harry Kane. It figures to be easier to convince Napoli rather than Tottenham, but not cheap. Reports also say that Real Madrid are likewise eyeing Osimhen as an alternative to their top targets.
