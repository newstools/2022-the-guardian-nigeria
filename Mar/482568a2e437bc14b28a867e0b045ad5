President of the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB), Rotimi Edu, at a meeting of the Nigerian Institute of Architects (NIA), said many buildings across the country are not fit and proper for human habitation because building codes are relaxed. Edu challenged NIA members to secure relevant insurances policy to cover their professional indemnity as well as others involved in their projects, knowing that negligence by any of their representatives had consequences for all. The leadership of the brokers’ body urged the Nigerian Institute of Architects to accept insurance policies that are relevant to their profession. He noted that members of the institute are mandated by law to have professional indemnity among other types of policies. The Chairman, Nigerian Institute of Architects, David Majekodunmi, who also spoke at the programme, blamed the incessant building collapse on the negligence of relevant government agencies. He lamented that the government had not been seen implementing several recommendations of panels of inquiries raised to address the menace of building collapse, particularly in Lagos State.
