Former Green Eagles winger, Adegoke Adelabu, has warned Super Eagles Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen, to be mindful of the calibre of players he parades in the fast-approaching World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars of Ghana. The Super Eagles will travel to Cape Coast on March 25 for the first leg of the last qualifying tie, with the reverse fixture billed for March 29 at the MKO Abiola Stadium, Abuja. Adelabu, who played club football with IICC Shooting Stars of Ibadan, told The Guardian, yesterday, that a coach with good team selection between Eguavoen and his counterpart in Ghana, will smile last at the end of the match. “The game with Ghana’s Black Stars will require a good ball carrier in the midfield to organise ball distribution,” Adelabu said. “The coach will also require a good striker, who will be able to use both feet around the goal area.  The rest of the players will have to prevent the opponents from scoring.” Adelabu added: “At the last AFCON tournament in Cameroun, many of the players in the Super Eagles squad put in effort to get into the team not because they had something special to offer at the end of the day. “Egauvoan should play back some of our crucial matches, and see whether the players did what he instructed. The strength of the team will be based on the potency of the instructions of the coach and the ability of the players to carry them out.” Adelabu, a sports scientist, also stated that it is important for Eguavoen to watch the matches played by Ghana Black Stars, the games they won and lost in recent times. “I want Eguavoen to ensure that only players, who are playing regularly in their clubs are picked for the encounter. Whatever system he will play, must be consistent with the abilities of the players to be picked. By now Eguavoen should know the players he needs to accomplish what he wants,” he stated.
