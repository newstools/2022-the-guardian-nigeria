Virginia has hired Missouri State coach Amaka Agugua-Hamilton as its new women’s basketball coach, the team said yesterday, tabbing the 38-year-old Virginia native to replace Tina Thompson. The school fired Thompson on March 3 after a 30-63 record in four seasons. Agugua-Hamilton led Missouri State to a 74-15 record in three seasons, including two NCAA Tournament appearances. The team won its First Four game against Florida State last week before losing to sixth-seeded Ohio State 63-56 in the first round on Saturday. In three seasons at Missouri State, the school defeated nine Power 5 opponents. “We are thrilled and very fortunate to have recruited Coach Mox to UVA,” Virginia athletic director Carla Williams said. “She is a gifted teacher, a skilled tactician of the game and a person who cares deeply about her players and vice versa. Her teams play with tremendous tenacity and confidence. “Coach Mox has a reputation for recruiting and developing talent. While these qualities are necessary to build a competitive programme, we have been most impressed with Coach Mox as a person. Her integrity, work ethic, passion for education and determination to build something special here at UVA is inspiring.” Agugua-Hamilton previously worked on staff at Michigan State, Old Dominion, Indiana and VCU. Virginia went 5-22 this past season and 2-14 in the ACC. The programme last reached the NCAA Tournament in 2018.
