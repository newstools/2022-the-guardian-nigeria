Whether you’re a 4C queen, 4B babe or a lowcut princess, we can all agree on one thing; wash days are the best yet dreaded part of every natural hair journey. So let’s ease the process for you, follow this step-by-step natural hair wash routine to get your afro popping and curls bouncing in no time at all. The reason you’re spending minutes detangling on your wash day is most likely because you’re not prepped in advance. Cut your detangling time in half by keeping your hair from getting super tangled the day before. Sleep with your hair packed properly under a silk bonnet to keep your curls fine. Before you begin washing at all, make sure to pre-poo with a deep conditioner or coconut oil. Leave on for between 15-30 minutes before getting to business. Divide and conquer; that’s the rule here. Cut your hair into sections or four equal parts to reduce knotting. Hold each part separate with two-strand twists. This way, it’s much easier to handle your hair while shampooing, making sure to focus on your scalp. Choose a gentle sulfate-free shampoo to remove product buildup and excess oil, making sure to lather properly. When you turn on the water, allow your hair to get wet before applying the shampoo to activate it. Apply the lathered shampoo onto your scalp, massaging with your fingertips. Once you’re done, stretch each section downwards, stretching your hair before smoothing the shampoo down to define your coils. If your hair’s drying out, don’t be afraid to add some more water. Finally, rinse out the shampoo with lukewarm water before repeating the process. Apply some conditioner with water before detangling. Next, apply your conditioner to the section (re-wetting the section if needed). Always use ample conditioner with water, and then detangle using your fingers to work the sections and leave to sit for some time. Not every Natural hair enthusiast will tell you about deep conditioning. But we would. If you’re dealing with hair concerns like dryness, breakage and shedding, you need a deep conditioner. For treating dryness, use a protein-free, moisturizing treatment that will target dryness. Choose a protein-based strengthening treatment for chemical concerns. Look for amino acids and keratin in your treatments. Once you’re done lathering your hair with all that treatment, it’s time to trap the moisture in. For wash and go’s, use a gel and lighter stylers like mousse or wrap foams for braids and twist outs.
