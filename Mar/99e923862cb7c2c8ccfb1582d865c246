Sir: The Civil Empowerment and Rule of Law Support Initiative (CERLSI) hereby warns politicians and anyone involved with the political processes leading to the 2023 Presidential elections to desist from actions that would lead to the imposition of candidates on Nigerians. CERLSI notes that consensus candidates are an aberration of a political process that places the ultimate power of the citizenry in the power of the vote. What we have witnessed in recent times during the conventions of some of the political parties is a selection of favoured candidates who have not tested their popularity or unpopularity on the battlefields of the democratic process.
   
What this, therefore, portends for the election in 2023 is that these favoured candidates will not allow the ballot to prevail, and will instead work to truncate the processes in favour of those who selected them. Consensus candidates supposedly for the sake of  ‘unity’ has no place in the electoral process. There is nothing consensus about a ‘consensus candidate’ if that candidate is the candidate of the preferred choice of an individual. A consensus candidate is a product of the popular will and an expression of the will of the people. The practice suppresses the ambitions of those who likely have programmes that would be of benefit to the Nigerian people given the opportunity of representation. CERLSI calls on Nigerians to get their PVCs and use it to elect candidates who have not been selected by vested interests. About CERLSI: To educate Nigerian citizens on the import of the vote, their rights and privileges under the laws of Nigeria. Our focal areas include engagement and capacity building, rule of law, community advocacy, media and Human Rights. Bob MajiriOghene Etemiku, wrote from Abuja.
