The emergence of Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, as Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CCECC), is destined by God, the deputy governor, Ahmed Ketso, has said. At a special prayer session for the governor, organised by the Commissioners’ Forum at Government House, Minna, on Tuesday, Ketso commended cabinet members for offering the prayer for the governor’s new national assignment. Ketso noted that the governor did not lobby for the national assignment. “Bello’s elevation as the CCECC chairman is an act of God. He never sought it; he is just a member of the committee. But God is always with someone that has pure heart,” Ketso asserted.
