Three houses – Pearl Palace (blue), Rubies Court (red) and Diamond (yellow) – will jostle for honours at Femfield School’s maiden inter-house sports competition held tomorrow at the school premises in Oke-Afa, Isolo, Lagos. The seven-year-old nursery and primary school will have pupils compete in ball balancing, Dunlop race, egg and spoon race, fill-in-the-bottle, skipping race, sack race and sprint events for boys and girls. Among the major attractions at the one-day meet are dance and robotics. According to the Director of Femfield School, Mrs. Olubukola Aribisala, the aim of the event is to unearth talents, as well as engender friendship among the pupils. “I believe that through sports, pupils can continue to actualise what they have discovered here with us in Femfield School,” she said. According to Aribisala, “Sports, especially football, is a huge source of foreign exchange earnings.” Through talent discovery and development, the fortunes of individuals and families can be changed. This can also impact communities and the nation. With football, our country can be repositioned to gain respect in the comity of nations.”
