Jorge Masvidal, who has twice been beaten by UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman surrendered to police on Wednesday night after allegedly sucker-punching Colby Covington – who is also a mixed martial artist who has twice been beaten by the Nigerian Nightmare. Masvidal faces a felony battery charge over allegedly attacking his former training partner outside of a restaurant in Miami on Monday night, Local 10 reported. He was being held in Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. Masvidal, according to a police incident report obtained by CBS Miami, snuck up on his old pal outside the eatery and “punched him with a closed fist two times in the face.” One-time roommates, the duo’s relationship went south and they even faced off against each other in the ring earlier this month – with Covington emerging victorious. On top of the loss, Masvidal was reportedly ticked off at Covington for talking about his kids ahead of their fight. Before Monday’s alleged attack, Masvidal fired off a tweet urging Covington to “show [his] face.” “You talk that [expletive] you gotta back it up, that’s how my city rolls man!” Masvidal said in a video posted to Twitter. Covington, with a record of 12 wins and 3 losses, is currently ranked No.2 in the UFC welterweight division. Two of his three losses came at the hands of Usman. Masvidal (35-16) is currently ranked No.8. The feud between Colby and Masvidal — who used to be best friends at one point — is well documented, with Covington going as far to call it a “blood feud.” Usman fought both Covington and Masvidal two times each on separate occasions — scoring victories over both men.
