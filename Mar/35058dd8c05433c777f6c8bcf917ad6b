It was a good thing that Willie Obiano, the former governor of Anambra State, had his baptism of fire early. Obiano was on his way to the United States for a well-deserved holiday when operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) accosted him at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, and asked him to step aside. After a few days at the EFCC pen, he was released on bail. He has joined the list of distinguished men and women who have marked their register with the EFCC. What has become the pattern is that after such experience, they usually find themselves in the Senate.
  
For eight interesting years, Obiano was the governor of Anambra while his vivacious wife, Ebele, was in power. Few minutes after Obiano ceased being the governor, what the ancient Romans would have considered a worrisome omen happened to his wife.
