The federal legislature recently tagged along with the executive to reject a bill proposing state police in the ongoing constitution amendment. As that session was unravelling in Abuja, defenceless Nigerians were being killed in Anambra, Benue, Borno, Edo, Sokoto, Niger and Kaduna, in another bloody weekend of routine mass killings. In-between the two scenarios is a failed central police system that could have been remedied by a decentralised police structure in the absence of any other solution from the federal government. Suffice to ask, therefore, who is afraid of state police, or a more secure and stable country that is liveable for all? The death toll is staggering, and so too is the laid-back disposition of the government whose primary validity is security of lives and well-being. On the day the National Assembly said no to the state police bill – drawn from a long list of 68 that sought to alter the 1999 Constitution – men of the Islamic State’s West African Province (ISWAP) raided four villages and killed at least 25 Nigerians in Borno. In Benue, suspected hoodlums invaded a burial ceremony to kill about 10 mourners. A day before, the media was awash with reports of terrorists killing farmers in Sokoto, Niger and Kaduna. About 20 were also killed at another siege on a funeral procession in Anambra State. The morning after the legislative debacle, it was the turn of an armed-robbery gang in Edo to ransack banks in daylight. These and many more make a mockery of the Nigerian State and its failed security system.
