Thanks to these procedures, you can adjust your face and body to match your concept of beauty. One of these popular cosmetic procedures is Fillers. Fillers are an aesthetic procedure that reverses sagging skin to its initial firmness, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. So, how can you tell if this procedure is right for you? And what do you need to know before and after getting fillers? Here’s your go-to guide on all you need to know about fillers to ensure a successful, botch-free session. Why Should I Get a Filler? One thing we can all agree on is that change is constant, and our skin isn’t left out. The older we get, the more our skin loses some important fibres that keep it elastic and firm. Also, some of the fat underneath the skin atrophies, causing the face to appear longer. These signs of ageing can easily be reversed by a facelift. A facelift is a surgical procedure that involves cutting away a section of skin and tightening excess skin over the area. As you can imagine, it is an invasive procedure. Nonetheless, its effects are more drastic and long-lasting. On the other hand, getting fillers is a preferred option for those looking for subtle yet definite improvements in their skin. Dermal fillers are non-invasive and reversible. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1705253 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty.jpg 1280w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-1062x598.jpg 1062w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-640x360.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-320x180.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-278x156.jpg 278w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-556x312.jpg 556w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-515x290.jpg 515w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-1030x580.jpg 1030w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-712x401.jpg 712w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-1424x802.jpg 1424w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Kylie-Jenner.-Photo-Getty-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Where can fillers be injected? Here are a few areas where your doctor might want to inject a filler and why: What are fillers made of? Filler components have a similar effect on your skin, but they may be gotten from a wide range of materials. Some fillers are endogenous substances. This is a list of some FDA-approved fillers for dermal use. How do I dissolve fillers? Depending on the type and brand of your filler, it may naturally dissolve within 6 months to 2 years. However, if you’d like to hasten the breakdown, first recall the brand of filler you employed. For hyaluronic acid fillers (the most popular kind), use an injection called Hyaluronidase. Within 24 hours, any sign of a filler will be gone. A sodium thiosulphate injection will rapidly dissolve a calcium hydroxylapatite filler. Experts say that dissolving a Sculptra module is often difficult, and living with an overfilled face is much easier than the procedure required to remove it. How not to use fillers The FDA states that fillers should not be used on areas except the face, lips and hands. The association especially warns against the use of fillers for the following: Improper use of fillers in the wrong locations or overuse in the right location may cause serious injuries, disfigurement, body dysmorphia, permanent scars or, in the worst-case scenario, death. How much do fillers cost in Nigeria? The price range varies from clinic to clinic, and one-shot may go for $500 in Nigeria. One shot of Botox costs about 200,000 Naira. What else should I know before I book an appointment? Getting a filler is not particularly painful, but your aesthetician will give you a local anaesthetic agent to numb the area or areas. After it wears off, you will feel some pain, and you may notice that the area is red and swollen. Do not panic; this doesn’t mean your appointment was botched. It might take 10-24hrs for the inflammation to subside, after which the filling may be assessed. Remember, before opting for any procedure, be sure to give careful thought to picking out a professional. Ensure your aesthetician is not only well trained but that they have great results and are readily available to address any of your concerns.
