There is obviously a secret plan being nurtured and promoted by a group of real estate developers, who think they are influential enough to rubbish democratic good governance in the country by being regulators at the same time. The plan has recently manifested in the current real estate bill in the National Assembly, ostensibly sponsored to satisfy their selfish agenda not for bringing sanity into the system.
 
Let me make it clear at the outset that I’m not opposed to regulation or establishment of a council that will guide operations in the real estate sector and restore the confidence of subscribers. That subscribers are daily fleeced by some unscrupulous players is an ugly tale that leaves a sour taste in the mouth, no doubt. About four months ago, the Senate blinked its eyes away from some contentious clauses and wrongly passed the Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill 2021. And any moment from now, the bill will land in the House of Representatives for concurrence. Therefore, it is at this point that the need to call the attention of the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila, to the many incongruities in the provisions of this bill.
