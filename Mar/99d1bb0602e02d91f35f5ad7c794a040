Bauchi State Police Command has banned the proposed procession to mark the sighting of the moon in the month of Ramadan in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ahmed Wakili, said the command had been hinted on a purported plan by some miscreants to disrupt the peace of the state during the procession. He added that the Commissioner of Police, Umar Sanda, had warned those hatching the motive to desist from such, as they would have the police to contend with. Wakili’s words: “He has directed all Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) and all Tactical Team Commanders/Operational Departments of the command to put in place more effort to identify, disarm, arrest and prosecute any person or group of persons involved in any attempt to disrupt law and order in the state or who will come out to occupy the streets under that guise.” “He implores the good people of Bauchi to continue to support the police in the fight against criminality, pledging the command, under his watch, shall continue to puncture activities of criminal ambassadors in the state. He also called on the law-abiding citizens of the state to go about their lawful business without fear of intimidation and to report any suspicious movement to the nearest police station.”
