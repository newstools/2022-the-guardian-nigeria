All is set for stakeholders in the energy sector to deepen discussion and create awareness on the economic possibilities of Nigeria’s gas sector. The conference, organised by the Energy Trade Group of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry is billed for March 29 and 30, 2022 at the organisation’s convention center in the nation’s capital. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Director-General of ACCI, Victoria Akai, said the summit was necessary at this time, following the current conflict in Europe and how it has precipitated an energy crisis. According to her, the crisis must serve as a lesson to Nigeria to ensure a speedy development of its gas resources and infrastructure. She added that the theme of the parley, ‘Building a sustainable gas economy’ is an important area of focus that must be given attention by stakeholders across the various government and business spectrum. Akai maintained that unlike other countries without sustainable alternatives, Nigeria has an option in gas, adding that the carbon reduction pledge made under the Paris agreement must be complied with. “The movement for energy transition is considered to be a global ideal. Within the context of save the planet movement, countries in Africa are working to device appropriate responses. “Across African capitals, the debate is on, as to what energy transition should mean for the peculiarities of each country. “For Nigeria, the fossil fuel question stirs us in the face. Even though Nigeria is not a major contributor to global emission, the country as a responsible member of the international community has it’s commitment to keep”, she said. Akai commended President Muhammadu Buhari for crafting a gas agenda which has now become the Nigerian response to the energy transition question. She added: “The gas commercialization agenda, the auto-gas initiatives and other policy responses have provided much needed answers for Nigeria’s need for energy transition.
