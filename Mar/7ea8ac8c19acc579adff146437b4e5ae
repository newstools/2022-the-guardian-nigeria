Dangote Cement, Dangote Sugar, NASCON, Dangote Oil Refinery and Dangote Fertiliser are participating in the two fairs. A statement from Corporate Communications Unit of Dangote Group said trade fairs had become a veritable avenue for the subsidiaries to bond with their customers. Officials from Dangote Fertiliser that was commissioned last week will be operating a special helpdesk for customers and farmers who want information on distribution and application of fertiliser. The desk is to be manned by well-trained officers who are groomed to answer all questions and inquiries regarding the use of fertiliser.

NASCON would be giving its customers a good treat at the fair even as it has added to the richness of its products. like Danq seasoning and stew/soup mixes and also embarked on an expansion of its distribution network to make the product more readily accessible to consumers.
