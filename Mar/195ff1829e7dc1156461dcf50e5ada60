The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has registered a total of 47,195 new voters in the ongoing Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) exercise in Plateau. Plateau INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Malam Halilu Pai, made the disclosure on Monday in Jos while briefing newsmen. Pai said 11,321 applicants were rejected for multiple registrations. He said that as at March 19, a total of 232,265 people did their online pre-registration. “Out of the number 79,454 people updated and transferred their voting locations and only 47,195 have completed their registration. “Out those who completed their registration,  40,491 have been approved by the commission. “Also 11,321 applicants have been rejected because they have previously registered, which is multiple registrations.” The REC told newsmen that the CVR would be suspended on March 22 to allow for display of claims and objections. Pai, however, said that the exercise would resume on April 11 and end on June 11, 2022. “By this, the commission has dedicated a whole year from June 2021 to June 2022 for the registration exercise. “We, therefore, call on all eligible voters to take advantage of the time left to ensure that they are registered to enable them to participate in the 2023 general elections coming up on February 25  and March 11, 2023,” he added. The REC announced that the number of polling units in the state has been increased from 2,631 to 4,989. He said that the increment cuts across all the 17 local governments in the state. Country Director, Centre for Youth Participation and Advocacy, Mr Chris Iyama, commended INEC for the various innovations adopted to improve the electoral process in the country. Iyama expressed optimism that with the innovations, the 2023 general elections would be a massive improvement on the 2019 elections. The country director called for more synergy between civil society organisations, the media and INEC to make the electoral process better. According to him, the organisation has played key role in advocating for the new electoral act recently signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.
