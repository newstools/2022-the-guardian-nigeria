Sir: The Advocacy for Alleged Witches (AfAW) condemns the torture, ill-treatment of animals in the name of witchcraft across Nigeria and beyond. As in the case of humans, cruelty to animals linked to witchcraft has largely been ignored and condoned. The belief that witches turn into animals to inflict harm on other human beings and their estate is pervasive in Africa. These animals include cats, dogs, bats, owls, etc.
 
In many societies, black cats and owls are often associated with witchcraft. Due to this superstitious notion, these animals have become endangered species. People attack, torture and kill them wherever and whenever they are seen in the communities. Their presence evokes panic, occult fears and anxieties. Their presence triggers suspicion of witchcraft and magical harm. People assume that some witchcraft attack is imminent. To thwart such an attack, these witch-animals are killed. They are treated without compassion.  AfAW urges the public to desist from attacking and killing animals in the name of witchcraft. The notion that human beings can turn into animals has no basis in reason, science and reality. Like alleged witch-humans, animals linked to witchcraft are innocent. Witchcraft belief is deployed against the wildlife, and to endanger the flora and fauna. The government should take measures to punish violators and all who treat animals with cruelty in the name of witchcraft. Nigerians, Africans, need to abandon these superstitions and occult fears that motivate them to abuse and ill-treat cats, owls and other animals.
