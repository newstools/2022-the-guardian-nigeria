Disburses N948 billion to boost farming, others
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday, said that the apex bank and the participating financial institutions had disbursed over N3 trillion intervention loans to facilitate economic recovery and generate employment opportunities since the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emefiele also said that the Federal Government had disbursed N948 billion to 4,478,381 small-holder farmers to boost food production in Nigeria, adding that apart from encouraging  farming, the lofty programme had generated an aggregate of 12.5 million direct and indirect jobs for Nigerian youths. The CBN governor stated this at the Ekiti State University (EKSU), Ado-Ekiti,  while delivering a convocation lecture titled: “The Role of Central Bank in Managing Economic Downturns,” to mark the 40th anniversary of the university. Besides, he said that 648,052 households and owners of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) benefited from the Federal Government-driven policy. In his submission, the Vice Chancellor of EKSU, Prof. Edward Olanipekun, described the 40 years of the establishment of the university as impactful in the life of the state, saying the university has been a reliable training ground for future leaders. Olanipekun said though the university is experiencing some challenges as an institution, no effort would be spared to keep the flag flying in its resolve to be a good citadel of learning for Nigerians. Chairman of the occasion and Catholic Bishop of Ekiti Diocese, Most Revd. Felix Ajakaiye, urged the governments to be more pragmatic in the implementation of some policies for them to be impactful on the citizens. “Our thought and actions must be practical-oriented. We have to go beyond lectures by being practical in dealing with policies that can benefit poor Nigerians,” the Bishop advised.
