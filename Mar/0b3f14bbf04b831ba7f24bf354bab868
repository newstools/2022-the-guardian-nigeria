As preparations for the May 28 national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) begin in earnest, the party is faced with a dilemma of adhering to its constitutional provision on zoning or leaving the Presidential race open to all aspirants.
 
Although the opposition party has inaugurated a 37-man zoning committee, headed by Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, to determine suitable zoning formula for the 2023 presidential election, party leaders and stakeholders are still divided on the issue. While some leaders from the North have been canvassing that PDP should concentrate on picking somebody who can win the election and return power to the party, some Southern governors insist it is the turn of the region to produce the next Presidential candidate of the party.
