The EndSARS panel on Thursday expressed dismay that Nigeria police failed to appear before the Independent Investigative Panel sitting in Abuja. The panel is investigating allegations of Human Rights Violations by the defunct Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other Units of the Nigeria Police Force. The panel was set up by the Federal Government in November 2020, following the #EndSARS Protest which was triggered by nationwide allegations of police brutality. The Secretary of the Abuja Panel, Mr Hillary Ogbonna, gave the feeling of the panel while briefing newsmen on the failure of police to be present at the panel sitting on Thursday. Ogbonna expressed surprise that none of the police officials needed was present at the panel in spite of the efforts by the panel to deliver its assigned tasks at a stipulated period. “If this non punctuality attitude of the police becomes a pattern it is capable of bringing setback to the mandate of the panel. “The panel will continue to engage the police authority and other stakeholders to seek their cooperation to ensure that justice is done to the victims of police brutality. “The records of the entire proceedings especially todays’ will be given to the police without any charge,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the panel had on Dec. 23, 2021 adjourned sitting and resumed on March 1, 2022.
