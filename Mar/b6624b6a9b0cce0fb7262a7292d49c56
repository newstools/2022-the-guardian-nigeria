The ruling All progressive congress (APC) has refuted the story making the round that the Governor Mai Mala Buni led caretaker committee has been sacked on the orders of President Muhammadu Buhari. APC in a statement by its caretaker secretary, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe maintained that there is no iota of truth in the story. “Our attention has been drawn to sponsored media reports on an imaginary leadership change in the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC),” Akpanudoedehe said. “The media report is fake news and should be disregarded. “The APC is a progressive political party guided by rules. Leadership changes are not announced by ‘sources’ through name dropping in the media. “We urge our teeming supporters, members, and indeed the general public to remain calm and support the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC CECPC conduct a rancour-free and credible National Convention deserving of our great party.” This is as the party national secretariat situated along Blantyre road in Wuse 2 Abuja has been cordoned by heavily armed security personnel. The development, according to a party source, is aimed at averting the breakdown of law and order.
