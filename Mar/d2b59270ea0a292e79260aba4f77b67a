The Court of Appeal, Sokoto Division, yesterday, threw out the appeal by former Governor Abdulaziz Yari’s group challenging the dissolution of All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker leadership by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party. A Federal High Court in Gusau had ruled in favour of the dissolution. Buni was, this week, replaced by Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, as chairman of the CECPC. The APC in Zamfara State, under Tukur Danfulani, received the appellate court’s ruling with joy. In a statement, yesterday, in Birnin Kebbi, spokesman of the party, Yusuf Gusau, commended the judiciary for a good work done. Buni dissolved the appellants as caretaker executive members of Zamfara APC. In the lead judgment delivered by Justice Pricilla Mahmud and supported by Justice Danjuma Muhammad, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the Federal High Court, Gusau, which declined jurisdiction to entertain the matter for being purely an intra-party affair, saying it should be resolved through internal mechanism of the party. However, Justice Fredrick Oho, who gave minority judgment, allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Federal High Court, Gusau. “With the judgment, it is glaring that APC leadership has acted within the ambit of the party’s laws and the nation’s constitution.” “As leaders, we enjoin all aggrieved members to join hands with the Danfulani leadership of the party in the state to move the party and the state forward by accepting destiny,” Gusau stated.
