Simplifyd Systems Inc., a YCombinator-backed Nigerian startup with focus on becoming the platform of choice for data-free access to the Internet across Africa, has taken a huge leap.
  
The company announced the launch of ZeroData, a toll-free Internet application platform, to solve the challenges associated with accessing affordable data amidst the staggering rate of data consumption, especially amongst mobile and web app users in emerging markets across Africa.
