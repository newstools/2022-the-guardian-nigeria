Yes, it was considered a sign of indisputable beauty. Unfortunately, times have changed and in this era, healthy skin is beautiful skin. Moles aren’t exactly unhealthy. Most moles remain dormant throughout life. However, a change in the shape, size, or color of a mole may signal a melanoma, one of the early signs of skin cancer. That said, moles are majorly removed for aesthetic purposes, not for health concerns.   Most moles and some kinds of birthmarks are classified as Melanocytic nevus. Melanocytic nevus is pigmented patches caused by a disorder of the pigment-producing cells, the melanocytes. When a melanocytic nevus is flat it is termed a birthmark. When it is raised or rough, it becomes a mole. Melanocytic nevi are usually non-cancerous. Moles tend to multiply with age and excessive exposure to the sun. If you’ve been subject to neither aging nor harsh UV rays, you may want to report the sudden increase in moles to your dermatologist. The options available for mole removal include Laser treatment, Radiofrequency, Punch excision, and Electrocautery. Of all four options, Laser treatment is the most acceptable. Laser treatment involves the application of a local anesthetic such as Lidocaine to the patch of skin housing the mole. Then, a high-energy light beam is made to pass through the mole for a few seconds. Within these seconds, the high-velocity light particles force the mole particles to break down and be dissolved into the bloodstream. It may take two or three appointments to get rid of a mole, but it is a safe, fail-proof method of mole removal. You can say goodbye to your childhood friend (the mole) in 30 minutes! Before scheduling that appointment, remember that you will be unable to wear makeup for a while. Immediately after the surgery, a red spot will be where your mole once was. This is evidence of microscopic bleeding. Do not wear makeup for at least 10 days. When the red patch is gone and your skin is smooth again, you may dab on whatever healthy products you wish. Laser removal is non-surgical and requires no incision. You may go to work right after the procedure!
