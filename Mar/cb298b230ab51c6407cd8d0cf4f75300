There were jubilations in parts of Delta North senatorial district, popularly called Anioma after a former member of the House of Representatives, Prince Ned Nwoko, obtained a People’s Democratic Party nomination form to represent the district in the Senate. Prince Nwoko confirmed that he has obtained the PDP expression of interest form to The Guardian on the telephone. Nwoko, one of the illustrious sons of Idumuje Ugboko, a community in Aniocha North local government area, had earlier contested for the Senate. In 2019, he contested the primaries with incumbent Senator Peter Nwaoboshi but for legal technicalities, he lost the race. But with the 2023 general elections, the coast seems clear for him to win the Senate without obstacles as the incumbent has moved to the APC while his popularity has swollen. Ned Nwoko is one of the frontline philanthropists in Delta State and indeed Nigeria. He has positively touched several lives through several programmes for youths, students, widows and persons with disabilities in Delta and Nigeria. Prince Ned Munir Nwoko is a British trained Lawyer. Born on December 21, 1960, into the Idumuje- Ugboko Royal family in Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State, Prince Nwoko attended the University of Keele in Staffordshire, United Kingdom. Here he acquired his Bachelor’s degree in Law and History. He then obtained an LLM in Maritime and Commercial Law from King’s College, London. He was subsequently called to the English Bar at Lincoln’s Inn. Prince Nwoko later qualified as a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales. He then set up his own firm, Ned Nwoko Solicitors and became the Principal Partner and Senior Consultant. At the zenith of his practice, his organisation had over 30 Lawyers in his employ and gained international acclaim for its meticulous and tenacious legal battles for financial probity, transparency, management and verification of foreign debts of third world countries and their component states.
