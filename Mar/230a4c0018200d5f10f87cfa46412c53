 As we celebrate Women’s Month, we renew our commitment to supporting women’s economic and social empowerment. U.S. Embassy Chargée d’Affaires Natasha Franceschi joined Mayor of Tunis Souad Abderrahim and Governor Kamel Fekih to inaugurate two refurbished public spaces in the historic Medina funded by USAID – US Agency for International Development as part of the Femme Medina program. Chargée d’Affaires Franceschi visited women artisans in Bab Souika square and a women’s training center in Sidi Bechir where the municipality of Tunis worked with local women to transform these spaces into inclusive venues to promote greater economic and social opportunities for women. This $500,000 USD initiative supports the creation of training centers, exhibitions to display handicrafts, outdoor libraries, playgrounds and public gardens in the medina of Tunis to generate new economic opportunities for women.
