Insurance players have partnered the Lagos State Safety Commission to address frequent building collapse in the state through digitalising compulsory occupier’s liability insurance. It would be recalled that Lagos State Government in 2017, expressed its readiness to introduce compulsory insurance to owners of buildings across the state to address the increasing incidence of building collapse. Addressing journalists at an insurance stakeholders’ engagement session with Lagos State, the Director-General, Nigeria Insurers Association (NIA), Yetunde Ilori, said that the measure is not a revenue-generating venture, but a focus on the safety of all and aimed at alleviating the adverse impact of building collapse. “The insurance industry in Nigeria has the capacity to indemnify all the liabilities that arise as a result of risk involved because insurance is a global business. “Insurance is not magic. If you understand how it works, you will know that the Nigerian insurance industry has the capacity to carry your risks. Lack of understanding may make people think it does not work. They take your premiums and pay you claims when risks occur “, she assured. She assured that NIA has taken another bold step to digitalise the purchase of occupiers’ liability insurance and called for support of the state even as she pledged the association’s commitment to work with the state to ensure a safer Lagos. The Director-General of the Lagos State Safety Commission, Lanre Mojola, stressed the need for event centre, school, bakery and restaurants owners among others to key into the initiative. He disclosed that based on data captured, 480 incidents of building collapses have been recorded in the State in the past 44 years.
