National U-19 Coach, Uthe Ogbimi, has described the age of players invited to the camp of the senior women national team in preparations for the six-nation T20i Invitational as very impressive. Ogbimi, who was with the women’s team in camp alongside its coaches, said the players showed great talent and ability during the training sessions. The team, with 36 players invited, opened camp in Benin for its first phase of preparation on February 27 but rounded off that phase on Wednesday. That number has since been reduced to 17 for the final phase of camping in Lagos from today ahead of the tournament holding from March 26 in Lagos. Of the 17 players, four were scouted from the recently concluded National Under 17 Cricket tournament in Abuja and Ogbimi has heaped praises on them. “There were lots of Under 17 players’ who were invited to senior team’s camp, and they all impressed me. “Worthy of note are players like Lillian Ude, Peculiar Agboya and Queen Joseph and I just saw that they made it to the next phase of camping. “While in Benin, I was blown away, when I saw the energy, talent and determination of these young players. “They showed you an example of what new breeds can bring to a team alongside young players who have also been in the team like Piety Lucky and Oseyande Omokhobhio. “These are players who will do service for Nigeria for a long time and they will support experienced hands like Blessing Etim, Agatha Obulor and Omonye Asika. “I have no doubt in my mind ahead of the tournament in Lagos,’’ Ogbimi added.
