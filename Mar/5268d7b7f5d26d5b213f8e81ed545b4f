The Commissioner of Police in Anambra, Mr Echeng Echeng, has directed the immediate enforcement of the suspension of all toll collections in the state. Echeng gave the order at a meeting with Heads of Tactical Units, Divisional Police Officers, and Heads of Departments across the Command in Awka on Sunday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gov. Chukwuma Soludo had, in his inaugural address on Thursday, suspended all tolls and placed a ban on illegal collections on the roads and at motor parks across the state. Soludo said all existing revenue collection contracts stood revoked until a new template that would address leakages would be released in a month’s time. NAN reports that contrary to the directive of the governor, some youths were still collecting tolls from tricycle and shuttle bus operators in the capital city, Awka, and those who refused to part with money got physically assaulted by touts. Echeng told the officers to ensure strictly that there was no touting and activities of self-acclaimed revenue collectors in the State. “All unscrupulous elements who engage in touting and other unlawful acts are warned to desist forthwith as the Command, under my watch, in collaboration with heads of sister agencies, has deployed personnel across the state. “We shall arrest and bring to justice anyone caught flouting this order. “We reaffirm the commitment of the Command towards crime prevention, restoration of law and order and enjoin law-abiding residents of the State to be vigilant and security conscious at all times. “You are encouraged to report all suspicious movements to the Police or, in case of any emergencies, to call 112 or 07039194332 for an immediate response,” he said.
