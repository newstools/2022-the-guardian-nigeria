 Namibian Women The Oshiwanbo culture of Namibia is rich and flourishing with a blend of cultural influences. Namibia is made up of 13 tribes, and their cultures are similar in certain respects as culturally most brides from this region go back home  2-3 weeks or 3-4 weeks before the main event. These trips made beforehand are intended to prepare for the wedding. Preparations that are to shape  a perfect wife which in some cultures like the caprivian culture includes bedroom tutorials for the soon-to-be bride.   In the Oshiwanbo culture of Namibia, the traditional wedding ceremony includes lots of chants, dancing, and ululation similar in manner with the Hausa women of Nigeria. cultural attire is marked by rich colours of pink, red and black hues that appear like the Asoke of Yoruba people in Nigeria. The oshiwanbo cultural attire  is customarily worn at wedding events; the cultural print powers up the gathering of family members. Other cultural wears worn by some tribes in Namibai are Odelela, Ohorokova and herero dress which are all usually bright toned and some have the history of being worn as an act of resistance against German colonists. During the 2-3 weeks stay, the bride is saddled with the responsibility of inviting the elders to her wedding and most importantly, at this time  guarded and not permitted to move around without the permission of her parents. Hence everything the bride does is carefully monitored. Upon a confirmed date for the wedding, the future bride goes to her mothers hut, hence locally called “oshotoshondjugo”. While she is there, the bride performs the ritual practice of inhaling the smoke from a flaming fire set in the middle of the house which represent blessings.
