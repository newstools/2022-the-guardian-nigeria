Federal High Court in Abuja, yesterday, refused to grant the application for bail filed by suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, and Assistant Commissioner of Police, Sunday J. Ubua. They were charged with five others in relation to offences of unlawful drug dealings. Justice Emeka Nwite, in his ruling, held that the prosecution had placed sufficient materials before the court to warrant the refusal of bail to both senior police officers. Instead, Justice Nwite granted accelerated hearing of the case.
