The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Leadway Assurance, Tunde Hassan-Odukale, has stressed the need for Nigeria’s leading insurers to leverage data to improve customer understanding and simplify insurance processes. In an interview, Hassan-Odukale said: “At Leadway, the remote/hybrid work model and the policy framework in place for implementation was in place before the COVID-19 pandemic. “This pro-activeness and the dexterity of our Business Continuity Plan (BCP) brought about the stability and seamless connections experienced during the pandemic. So, we were able to provide our customers with a consistent experience whenever and wherever they needed it during the lockdown as we had automated processes already in place before the pandemic. “Also, there have been engagements and an increased drive towards self-service channels such as downloading our mobile app and visiting the website. We offered a live chat experience that helped us to communicate with our clients and policyholders in real-time. Staff are also sensitised to the need for exceptional speed for idling times while also maintaining a work-life balance.” He asserted that the accelerated drive towards digital engagement and online customer touchpoints had not disrupted services to those who favour in-person service interactions. “Customers who would prefer to visit our offices to transact their businesses have not been ignored”, he added.
