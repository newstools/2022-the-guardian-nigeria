The Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC) has called for the implementation of the Designated Export Warehouse (DEW) project to end multiple cargo examinations and boost the country’s export volumes. PEBEC Technical Lead, David Uzosike, who made this call in Abuja, on Monday, while presenting the National Action Plan (NAP) 7.0 Agro-Export Reforms Midway Progress Report, added that the implementation of DEW project would also encourage priority and free movement of designated export container-laden trucks. Uzosike maintained that the move would also lead to drastic reduction in current time for export cargo examination as well as congestion at the terminals and create space for new containers. According to him, a reform in the payment and verification process will boost forex inflow from export if exporters have unfettered access to the foreign exchange proceeds earned by them, maintaining that it is also pertinent to extend privileges given to Diaspora remitters to have free access to their foreign exchange. Stressing the need to allow exporters to have free access to their foreign exchange, Uzosike called for an increase in volume of exports and urged regulators to work with terminal operators to prioritise exports and enhance process efficiency. He further stressed the need to audit and streamline the current physical inspection process for agro-exports, publish and enforce an official timeline to drastically reduce the current time for export cargo examination. Uzosike called for investigation of reported cases of rent-seeking behaviour to enthrone transparency in payment process and eliminate rent seeking/corruption in the system. PEBEC Secretary, Dr. Jumoke Oduwole, on her part, explained that the essence of NAP 7.0 was to ensure increased volume of exports and volume of foreign exchange in the country.
