The secondary school sporting event, which started on March 9, at Yaba College of Technology, ended yesterday, March 11. Speaking, Portfolio Manager, Non-Alcoholic drinks, NB Plc, Omotunde Adenusi, said only school teams that come tops at the state finals will take part in the national finals billed for Abuja. She said the need to prepare young talents since inception was necessary to impact, groom and prepare them for the global stage. While the young sports champions contend for prizes comprising medals, cash prizes, laptops and educational tablets, Adenusi said this year’s overall winner will not only be celebrated as a record-breaking athlete of the year but will also represent Nigeria at the World School Games held in China in November this year. She said the participating young athletes in the games have a chance to shine at a variety of track and field events and games sessions such as 100m, 200m, 400m, 4x100m and 800m races, long jump, high jump and javelin, chess and scrabble. According to her, the state finals will be held not only in Lagos but also in Akwa Ibom, Kaduna, Jos and Kano states. She said the Maltina School Games is an annual sports festival sponsored and hosted by Maltina in partnership with the Nigeria School Sport Federation. “Since the inception of these Games in 2019, we have been awed by the number of grassroots sports talents we have been able to impact, groom and prepare for the global stage. At this year’s edition again, we plan to make national stars out of local talented athletes by providing a platform for them to hone and showcase their abilities. This year’s edition is themed “Building Champions, Sharing Happiness” and is aimed at identifying and nurturing local sports talents to represent Nigeria on the world stage,” she added.
