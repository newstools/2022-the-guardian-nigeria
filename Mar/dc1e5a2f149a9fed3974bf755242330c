Former international, Etim Esin, has predicted that a Super Eagles’ victory over Ghana in the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualification playoff will end the clamour for another foreign coach for the senior men’s national team. Ghana’s Black Stars will host the Eagles in the first leg of the playoff in Kumasi tomorrow, while the return leg holds on March 29 in Abuja. Esin told The Guardian, yesterday, that the players must be ready for a fierce battle against the Ghanaians, adding that the dream of every player is to play at the World Cup. “We are talking about the World Cup ticket here against Ghana. There are some young players in our team who have not played at the World Cup. Osimhen has never played at the World Cup, while Moses Simon missed the last edition in Russia due to injury. We need such players, who have the hunger and drive to play at the World Cup by ensuring the country qualifies ahead of Ghana. “What killed us at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroun was the lack of a point man like we used to have in the days of the late Rashidi Yekini. Whoever the coach picks as the point man should be ready to deliver the ticket to Nigeria. “There shouldn’t be any excuse, especially in the first leg in Kumasi, because the result of that match in Ghana will definitely count. And if the players can grab at least a draw in Ghana, then they can return home and get the job done here,” he said. He said the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) could change their mind and decide to go for a foreign coach if the team fails to qualify for the World Cup, adding, “This is what I don’t want to give a thought. I wish Coach Eguavoen and the team the best of luck.”
