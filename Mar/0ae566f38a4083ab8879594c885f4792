Organisers of the yearly Ondo Auto Rally have confirmed that the fifth edition of the multi-event car racing show will hold from April 16 to 17, 2022 at Akure and Ilara-Imokin in Ondo State. President of Work and Play, the group organising the event, Adeoye Ojuoko, at the weekend, disclosed that it has received a number of endorsements, especially from the host state government, and has also attracted new partnerships that would be unveiled before the event gets underway next month. “The Ondo Auto Rally has never been received as we are being received this year. The state government and all the government’s arms that should give us support in the host state have been supportive so far and it goes to show the level of interest and value the event has generated in the state since it debuted,” he said. Ojuoko said the event has become a top tourism programme on the calendar of the state, adding, “we have had people join us from virtually all the geo-political zones of the country and it has also risen to become a major rallying point for the auto racers in the country. “More than 60 racers from different racing clubs across the country have signed up to be part of the weekend event.” He added that the highest safety measures have been put in place to ensure a hitch-free event. “The Nigerian Police Force, the Federal Road Safety Corps and the Amotekun have assured us of their full involvement, as in the past. We also have all our participants sign up to best racing practice including standard procedures and checks for all participating persons and vehicles,” he said. The winners of the races will win cash prizes, while other activities like drifting, Treasure hunt and Archery have all been included to keep guests and friends entertained on the sideline.
