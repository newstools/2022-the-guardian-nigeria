The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has resolved not to extend the March 26 registration deadline for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE). JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, dropped the hint yesterday, while speaking at the Global Distance Learning Institute, Abuja, where he had gone to monitor registration exercise, noting that between 1.5 million and 1.6 million candidates had been captured. He expressed concerns that the closing days were experiencing low turnout nationwide, stating that only one candidate turned up for registration at the centre, instead of the usual 200 candidates per day, while registration across the country reduced to less than 20,000 two days ago, as against the 70,000 to 80,000 daily registrations. The Registrar said: “Today is March 21, 2022. We still have five days to go, and you can see how vacant the CBT centres are. So, we are telling you so that nobody on the 26th will have the guts to tell us to extend. Now, we have registered about 1.5 to 1.6 million candidates. So, we are good to go.”
