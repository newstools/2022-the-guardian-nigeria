Former World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua, yesterday, dismissed James Joyce’s ‘hilarious’ jibe at him, saying he has gone past fighting boxers in Joyce category. Joyce took to his twitter handle to criticise Joshua, whom he dubbed a glass jaw that had everything given to him on a platter.
He said: “And @anthonyjoshua,  you having a meltdown, where are all your belts? All those sponsorships and endorsements helping? You’re a glass cannon, quit the act, you were given everything. #easymode.” Joshua, whose rematch with Ukrainian, Oleksandr Usyk, is on hold following the WBO, IBF, WBO champion’s involvement in his country’s war against Russia, dismissed Joyce as a fighter seeking attention. He replied, also on his twitter handle, “I’ve shared this ring with most people you see in the heavyweight division today. I boxed Otto wallin twice as youngsters and I boxed Joe and stopped him in one round. I’d do the same thing today. Ain’t nothing changed.” Joshua reminded Joyce that he scored a first round knock out when both fighters met early in their career, adding that he has nothing to prove again. Meanwhile, promoters and boxing fans have started clamouring for a fight between Joshua and Wailin or former champion, Deontay Wilder, since the rematch with Usyk is not feasible for now. Also, yesterday, Wailin took to his social media to remind the boxing world that he is the most suitable opponent for Joshua in the absence of Usyk. He asked Joshua: “@anthonyjoshua, is there anyone else that’s a southpaw and has a similar style to Usyk than me? I’m the perfect guy for the interim fight except the risk of course.”
