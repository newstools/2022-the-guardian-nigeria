A  member on the board of the Nigeria Cricket Federation (NCF), Professor Mariam Suleman, has described the forthcoming Women’s T20 Invitational as a milestone in the development of women’s cricket in the country. Suleman, who lauded the NCF board, led by Uyi Akpata, for his passion and drive for women’s cricket, added that the event would boost the growth and interest of women in the sport. Five nations alongside Nigeria will feature at the T20 Invitational beginning from March 26 to April 4 at the recently renovated Tafa Balewa Square (TBS) Cricket oval in Lagos. “This tournament is going to be a turnaround for cricket in Nigeria. It is also going to be a milestone event for women’s cricket in the country,’’ Suleman, who was the leader of delegation to T20 Women’s World Cup qualifiers in Botswana, said. “We will be able to see how far our team has improved since our last outing in Botswana last year as well as expose young talents.” The academic, with Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, said she was optimistic of Nigeria’s performance at the event. “I expect nothing short of victory from the girls. The team has been in camp for over two weeks in Benin and will begin a final phase of camping this week in Lagos. “They also have a great blend of experienced as well as young talented players, which is a good one for them and I hope it all works to our advantage,’’ she said. Ghana, the Gambia, Sierra Leone, Cameroun alongside hosts Nigeria, will battle for honours when hostilities begin in Lagos and Suleman is confident that the Female Yellow Greens will edge out the others. “We have played against Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Ghana before now, so we know their strength and weaknesses. We just need to capitalize on their errors and turn it to our advantage,’’ Suleman added.
