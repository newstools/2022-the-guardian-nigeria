Now a yearly occurrence, ASUU strikes impede the Nigerian educational system, throwing the academic calendar off course and extending the duration of study. A recent cover by Guardian Life recorded that since its inception in 1999, ASUU has cumulatively gone on strike for over 50 months (more than four years). Nigerian students have left no stone unturned to express their displeasure and protest against the continued paralysis of academic action caused by this strike action. In fact, at the meeting held between the FG and the ASUU on Monday, NANS expressed their displeasure at the continued strike action demanding answers to which the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu walked out on.
