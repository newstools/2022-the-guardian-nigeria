House of Representatives will, today, file an appeal against the judgment of a Federal High Court against the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, even as it expressed confidence it would emerge victorious. Spokesman of the House, Benjamin Kalu, who briefed newsmen in Abuja, insisted the powers of the National Assembly could not be usurped by any arm of government. Kalu said if the judgment is sustained, it would be a clear case of legislative interference, which could ruin the power of the legislature. MEANWHILE, Senate has set machinery in motion for diversification of the nation’s economy. The Economic Diversification Council, when established, will serve as a special purpose vehicle for facilitation of the initiative. The Council, as explained in a bill sponsored by Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC, Niger North) and passed for second reading, will be self-funding after a take off grant of N1.618 billion in the first year. The legislation is titled: ‘A bill for an Act to establish the Nigerian Economic Diversification Council and provide for comprehensive framework, structures, programmes and schemes for strengthening capacity development in that direction’. Abdullahi said the new approach would be a departure from policy pronouncements of the past.He said: “Specifically, the objectives of this bill is to have a legislative framework for diversification of the Nigerian economy. “It includes the establishment and maintenance of programmes for the overall development of the Nigerian economy. More especially, it will encourage the growth of Nigerian industries, services and technologies to diversify the economy and raise the standard of living to a reasonable level. Senate President Ahmad Lawan, thereafter, passed the bill to the Committee on National Planning and Economic Affairs for further work and presentation of a report within four weeks.
