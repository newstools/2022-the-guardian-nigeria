 Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TİKA) renovated and put into service a health center that serves nearly 3,000 people in Ethiopia.  The opening ceremony of the health center, which serves law enforcement officers and detainees in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, was attended by Yaprak Alp, Türkiye’s Ambassador to Addis Ababa; Cengiz Polat, TİKA’s Program Coordinator in Ethiopia; and Ethiopian officials. TİKA renovated and furnished the health center and provided many pieces of medical equipment such as autoclaves, microscopes, gurneys, examination tables, and centrifuge machines. In his speech at the opening ceremony, Cengiz Polat, TİKA’s Program Coordinator in Ethiopia, stated that 2022 marked TİKA’s 30th anniversary and that the office in Addis Ababa was TİKA’s first office in Africa. He noted that TİKA has implemented nearly 200 projects in the country since 2005, including the project for the donation of medical supplies, crutches, and wheelchairs to hospitals in the provinces of Afar and Tigray in 2016. Polat said, “We touch people’s lives by providing state-of-the-art medical devices and equipment to the health center, which serves under difficult conditions here. We are improving its service quality. We want to put a little smile on people’s faces by helping this health center, which serves nearly 3,000 people, to operate under better conditions.” Serving hundreds of detainees, as well as law enforcement officers and their families, the health center employs 11 healthcare providers from different specialties.
