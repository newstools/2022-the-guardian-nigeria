Say Nigeria needs technocrat as president Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State have asked the party to give the presidential ticket to the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, stating that Nigeria needs a technocrat leader to move the country forward. The party members, who stated this yesterday, at the local APC members’ interaction, maintained that Osinbajo had over the years shown himself to be a man of character, competent and reliable. Director of Operations, Osinbajo Global Movement, Mrs. Temilade Okesanjo, said Nigeria needs a leader that has a track record of solving problems, and good pedigree. She said: “We are here to talk about the importance of APC giving us Osinbajo for 2023 presidential election. We have members in all the local councils and Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in Lagos. They are well represented here. All they say is that the APC should give us Osinbajo for 2023. Osinbajo has got the capacity, character, integrity and all that we need to fix Nigeria. Everyone is clamouring for him in the South-East, South-South, South-West and even the North.” ALSO, Diaspora Convener of the movement, Dayo Akintobi, said it is important for Nigerians to take their destiny in their hands and support a leader who has the best interest of the country at heart.
