Nigeria’s contingent to this year’s World Athletics Indoor Championships in Belgrade, Serbian capital city, is taking a good shape, according to the Technical Director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Samuel Onikeku. The Belgrade 2022 World Indoor will hold from March 18 to 20. The standard of the competition is expected to be extremely high as many Olympic champions are set to compete in Belgrade. According to the AFN Technical Director, Team Nigeria will parade top athletes, who are based in the United States of America. He revealed that the AFN was in regular talk with Nigerian athletes, most of who will participate in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) for their various schools in the United States between March 11 and 14. “We have listed ten of our U.S.-based athletes for the World Indoor in Belgrade. We are monitoring them, and I am hopeful they will give us good results,” Onikeku stated. The Guardian learnt yesterday that two coaches from Nigeria, including former sprinter, Endurance Ojokolo, will join the team in Belgrade.
