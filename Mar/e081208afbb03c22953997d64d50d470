The Nigeria Football Supporters Club has appealed to all Super Eagles’ fans to close ranks and give maximum backing to the senior national team ahead of their crucial Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Black Stars of Ghana in Cape Coast and Abuja. Nigeria is billed to meet Ghana in Cape Coast on March 25 before coming home to host the Black Stars at the MKO Abiola National Stadium, Abuja, on March 29. The winner of the tie over two legs will qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Chairman of the foremost fans club in the country, Rev. Samuel Ikpea, believes such united support from sports loving Nigerians would guarantee Super Eagles qualification for the World Cup. He said: “As the ultimate face and father of Nigeria football supportership, the NFSC wants the corporate world, sports philanthropists and other genuine stakeholders to rally round the Super Eagles through ensuring massive support. “The Supporters Club needs adequate moral and financial support to enable thousands of our members be at the Cape Coast Stadium on March 25. There is need for adequate travel arrangement from those who truly love Nigerian football. “We have the pedigree to make Super Eagles feel at home before, during and after the match in Cape Coast,” said Ikpea, who added that focus should shift from monetary promise to Super Eagles in hotel rooms to mobilising supporters adequately. While predicting a Super Eagles’ success over Ghana in the World Cup qualifier, Ikpea revealed that plans are underway for a friendly game between Nigeria Football Supporters Club and their Ghanaian counterparts in Accra on March 22, 2022. He said the friendly game is to promote sporting relationship between both countries before the World Cup qualifiers.
