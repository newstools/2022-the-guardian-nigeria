Enugu State governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, said he is committed to serving Enugu State people, who gave him their mandate on two occasions and would therefore not be distracted by overzealous politicians.
   
Ugwuanyi, who spoke through his Special Adviser on Media, Barrister Steve Oruruo, explained that he will continue his programme of quiet infrastructural and human capital development to the end of his term.  “The 200-Bed ESUT Teaching Hospital project in Nsukka and other rural development initiatives are what the governor is particular about more than politicking. His Excellency is focused on his mandate and would not like to join issues with those, who want to distract him or plunge the state into unnecessary chaos over political permutations.”
   
Oruruo disclosed that Governor Ugwuanyi will continue to pursue his inclusive and ecumenist style of leadership, stressing that the approach has endeared the governor to many people both in Enugu and Nigeria as a whole.
    
“Peace and harmonious social co-existence mean the world to His Excellency, who, as a child of God has continued to restrain himself from joining issues with those whose stock in trade is stoking misunderstanding. Thankfully, he had successfully engendered a reengineering of the political psyche of the people to embrace peace, conciliation and love for one another, as opposed to unbridled violence since inception of this regime,” he stated.
