While rising to popularity now, this skincare process has been used for several years in skin care. Cryotherapy, cool sculpting and sclerotherapy are just a few forms skin icing has taken over time. Now, the process has gotten as simple as rubbing an ice cube on your face, here’s all you need to know about skin icing in skincare. Ice is a well-known secret to having clear skin and a healthy glow. To unlock these skincare benefits, you simply have to use an ice cube on your face, whether it is to reduce your under-eye or face puffiness. Now there’s a reason behind this madness: applying ice to the skin causes blood to rise to the skin’s surface, smoothing and tightening the skin while leaving behind a rosy glow. To properly prep for an ice facial, start by gently cleaning your skin with micellar water and a cotton pad. Next, apply a moisturizer to your face to protect your skin barrier. Also, make sure to avoid sun exposure during the process and clean the roller before use.
