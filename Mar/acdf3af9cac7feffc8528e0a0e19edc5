A 42-year-old Nigerian and his 38-year-old South African accomplice have been charged to court for posing as Hawks and attempting to extort a refugee. The Hawks are the South African Police Services’ Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI), which targets organised crime, economic crime, corruption, and other serious crime referred to it by the South African Police Service (SAPS). Stanley Ewulu, a Nigerian national based in Sandton, and Peter Molomo, a South African national from Pretoria West, appeared at the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court this week facing charges of extortion and corruption. There is even more trouble for Ewulu, as he will face a further charge of being in South Africa illegally. “It is alleged that the pair approached the complainant, introduced themselves as Hawks investigators from the Pretoria office and demanded R300,000 (about ₦8,224,212) in order to destroy a case docket that was opened against him,” said Lumka Mahanjana, the North Gauteng regional spokesperson for the director of public prosecutions. “They also promised to hand over a vehicle that belonged to the complainant, as well as his refugee documents that were confiscated by the Sunnyside police.” According to reports, problems started for Ewulu and Molomo after the complainant reported the matter to the Hawks serious corruption investigation unit in Germiston. An entrapment operation was set up and the two were arrested last week at Time Square in Menlyn, east of Pretoria. The matter was postponed to March 22, for further investigations and possible bail applications.
