And one of those downs is that, in some cases, you might have to deal with unrequited love. Nothing sucks more than realising the woman you want to be with has no feelings for you, and your love is definitely one-sided. So how do you know when she’s not that into you? These 5 signs should help you figure it out ASAP. If she cancels on you every time, chances are she might not feel the same way you do. However, you should also note that cancellations may come up for everyone once in a while due to unforeseen reasons. So if she needs a rain check occasionally, there’s probably nothing to worry about. BUT! If she is always cancelling plans, especially at the last minute, there’s a much higher chance that she’s just not into you. To play safe, after she cancels, leave it to her to suggest a make-up date at her convenient time; if she doesn’t, it might be time to move on. “How are you? Fine!” “Had a good day? Yes!” If this sounds familiar, there might be some unrequited love growing there. Communication is essential to the success of every relationship, so if she doesn’t talk to you, she probably doesn’t want you. This only works if you don’t piss her off and if it always goes on like this. Also, look out for whether or not she leaves you on read and doesn’t ever initiate conversations. If she says this more than once, especially after you’ve both been texting and going on dates for a while, the sad news is; you may never make it out of the friend zone. If she was to be friends, it’s probably best you stay friends. If she never agrees to make plans of being together sometime in future, I’m not sure you need a much clearer sign. However, there might also be genuine reasons why she doesn’t want to make forever plans. In this case, it’s up to you to now use your instincts. Asking the right questions and noting how often this happens would help you figure out whether or not her refusal to commit signifies disinterest, She might listen to you speak, show up to every date, but if she never lets you into her life, it’s probably because she doesn’t want you. Dealing with one-sided feelings can be tricky, but it’s not the end of the world, so all you need to do is figure out a way to move on healthily until you find someone else who feels the same way as you.
