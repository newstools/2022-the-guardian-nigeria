Kano High Court has overruled the alleged threat to life, torture and confession under duress by Abdulmaliq Tanko and Fatima Musa against police, in the murder case of Hanifa Abubakar. The prime suspect and his accomplice, who are standing trial for the killing of the five-year-old girl in Kano, had debunked their statements, insisting they were compelled under threat to confess. At the resumption of the trial, yesterday, Justice Usman Na’aba ruled that there was no substantive evidence before the court to prove that the suspects were not responsible for their statements obtained by the police. Justice Na’aba ruled that Tanko could not prove the identity of the device, which he claimed was used to penetrate his body parts. He adjourned the matter till March 22, 2022, for the continuation of the hearing on the matter.
