Pollicy, a feminist technology collective based in Uganda, will launch its Digital Ambassadors programme in honour of the International Women’s Day celebration.
  
This initiative is dedicated to bringing swift solutions to the problems and continued prevalence of the digital gender divide that disproportionately affects young women across Uganda, Tanzania and the larger African continent by fostering the absence of economic well being on the continent.
    
Pollicy believes that through the upskilling and intentional inclusion of more young women in the digital space, they can get access to digital tools and exposure to more meaningful digital use, hence the implementation of innovative initiatives like the Digital Ambassadors programme that provide customized solutions, which aim to close the digital gender divide through the creation of access to technology, digital literacy and online safety.  Programs Manager at Pollicy, Phillip Ayazika, stated that, “the program launch will not only mark the ﬁve year milestone of Pollicy’s impact across East Africa but also usher its further contributions to causes that are prevalent in all regions of sub saharan Africa, particularly problems associated with limited digital access,literacy and online safety experienced by women in sub-saharan Africa”.
  
The digital ambassadors program was launched virtually on March 3rd, in Tanzania and Uganda and this will be followed by the Nigerian & South African launch in the third-quarter of the year 2022.
