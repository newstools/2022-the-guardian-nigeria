Rapid depreciation of the naira has outclassed the economic intelligence and electoral promises of the current administration as it did to its predecessors. But without a revamped strategy at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), to gain a major foothold on the exchange rate through supply and demand, and elimination of political interference in the mix, the ripples of weaker naira on inflation are bound to be worse.
   
Indeed, issues relating to the appropriate exchange rate for the naira in relation to other currencies have remained topical over the years. Accordingly, the concern on the real value of the naira has elicited comments from scholars, multilateral institutions and other stakeholders including self-styled economic experts. Some of these claim to have a quick-fix solution to Nigeria’s economic problems as well as the way out of the exchange rate quagmire.  Efforts are also needed on the demand management side in relation to the promotion of Made-in-Nigeria goods, in the sourcing of raw materials by manufacturers as well as the elimination of political interference in the allocation of foreign exchange to eligible end-users. Except for these and many policies, options are adopted, the indicated rapid depreciation of the naira in the IMF report would continue as well as the negative effect on the rate of inflation. These would not be in the overall best interest of the wobbling Nigerian economy.
