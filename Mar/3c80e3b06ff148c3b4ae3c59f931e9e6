It was a glorious sight to behold on February 28th, 2022, as we saw many of our favourite celebrities walk the red carpet in stunning designer outfits at the Screen Actor Guild (SAG) awards. Two days after the event, we still find ourselves obsessing over many of the incredible looks that graced the carpet. From Lady GaGa’s showstopping white Armani Privé column gown with a sequin bodice to Cynthia Erivo’s custom Louis Vuitton vinyl strapless gown, we can boldly agree that the red carpet was truly a magical moment. Though everyone dressed to impress, here are our top ten picks for the best-dressed celebrities at the 2022 SAG awards. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683300 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jada-Pinkett-Smith.-Photo-Getty-scaled-e1646226392126.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1798" /> An unpopular saying goes, “If you want to wear navy blue, at least wear it well.” Jada Pinkett Smith looked effortlessly beautiful in the vintage Gareth Pugh design, which had a structured bodice and a huge skirt. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683270 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-399x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1918" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-769x1152.jpg 769w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty-400x600.jpg 400w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Emilia-Jones.-Photo-Getty.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> If there is one thing we learned from seeing Emilia Jones on the red carpet, it is “go sheer or go home.” Wearing a custom Givenchy gown, Emilia Jones fully defines elegance and proves that a thigh slit is the best thing to happen to gowns. And please don’t get us started on the amazing details like the crystal florals. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683272 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Salma-Hayek.-Photo-Gettyimages-scaled-e1646225538414.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1920" /> When she is not playing the beloved Ajak in the popular Marvel movie, Eternals, Salma Hayek storms red carpet events in fabulous outfits. With a satin coral-coloured gown by Gucci on her body, Salma Hayek strikes a gorgeous pose, flaunting her sheer gloves. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683275 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty-432x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1773" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty-432x598.jpg 432w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty-173x240.jpg 173w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty-347x480.jpg 347w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty-433x600.jpg 433w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Vanessa-Hudgens.-Photo-Getty.jpg 784w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> The category is “couture excellence”. As if the Atelier Versace double silk column gown wasn’t enough to slay the red carpet, Vanessa Hudgens also blew our minds with her trendy bob hairstyle. Sexy, classy, and chic are not enough to fully express how incredible she looked. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683276 size-full lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1799" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty.jpg 1200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-399x598.jpg 399w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-768x1152.jpg 768w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-1025x1536.jpg 1025w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-160x240.jpg 160w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-320x480.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Hailee-Steinfield.-Photo-Getty-400x600.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /> There is nothing more beautiful than seeing a new spin on a black dress. Hailee Steinfeld looked stunning in a gleaming black dress by Miu Miu at the SAG 2022 award ceremony. There is no denying the hard work that went into creating the dress, especially the bodice cut out.
