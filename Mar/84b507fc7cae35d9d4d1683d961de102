The Federal Government has said it is desirous of having the revenue authorities in Nigeria and that of Niger Republic work together to improve the revenue generation capacity of both countries. Executive Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Muhammad Nami, disclosed this yesterday when he received his Niger Republic counterpart, the Director-General of the Niger Tax Authority, Mallam Ousmane Mahamane and his delegation at the headquarters of the FIRS in Abuja. Nami said there is a need for the revenue authorities of both countries to work together to deepen their relationship, share tax information and engage in mutual administrative assistance. Recognising the long-standing relationship and shared culture and languages of the two countries,  Nami noted that it was important for the FIRS to work with the Niger Tax Authority given the “presence of high-net-worth Nigerian individuals and companies trading in Niger with significant tax implications, which is of great interest to the FIRS.” The FIRS executive chairman also highlighted the working relationship enjoyed by the service and the Niger Tax Authority in the past, particularly on the community rule on double taxation and transfer pricing. He stated that there was the need for further cooperation in the areas of sharing of tax information and mutual administrative assistance, especially in the face of an increase in trans-border tax within the context of ECOWAS and AFCFTA. The Director-General of the Niger Tax Authority, Mahamane, in his remarks stated that there was an urgent need for international tax cooperation between the two institutions. He noted that his organisation was seeking a relationship with the FIRS that would cover cross-border trade, oil sector, telecommunications sector, digitalization of tax procedures, exchange of tax information, assistance with a tax audit, separation of administrative procedures, modernization of tax administration and human capacity development.
