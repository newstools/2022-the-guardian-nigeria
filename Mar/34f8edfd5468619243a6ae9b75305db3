The Russian-Ukrainian conflict may have continued to take toll on the equities sector of the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) as the market extended its bearish trend, causing market capitalisation to dip further by N58 billion. Specifically, at the close of trading yesterday, the All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 108.26 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.23 per cent, to close at 47,154.35 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N58 billion to close at N25.414 trillion. The market’s negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks which are; Nestle Nigeria, Conoil, Nigerian Breweries, Flour Mills of Nigeria and Lafarge Africa. GTI Securities Limited said, “The Nigerian domestic market extended its bearish trend to five consecutive days, as investors weigh the risk of the Russian-Ukrainian war on the local bourse. However, we expect bulls to return to the market given the spate of corporate actions, we anticipate improved market activity to encourage a bullish response this week.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Barring any block transactions, we are likely to see a tepid session tomorrow amid recoveries in some of the major sectors.” The market breadth was negative as 28 stocks declined relative to 16 gainers.
