The Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III, has predicted that Ogun would soon join the oil-producing states as oil and other petrol-carbon products would be discovered in the state. The monarch made the prediction when he paid a courtesy visit on Governor Dapo Abiodun at the Presidential Lodge in Abeokuta. The Olu said the state had all it takes to be an oil-producing state just like those in the Niger Delta. He said his visit was to identify with the people of Yorubaland, as Warri people regard themselves as part of the Yoruba stock. In his remarks, the Alake of Egbaland, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, who accompanied the Olu of Warri on the visit, said Nigerians are one and same people no matter where they come from, stressing the need for all Nigerians to promote their culture and work towards a united country. In his response, Abiodun urged Nigerians to see themselves as people with common ancestry, history and therefore work towards a peaceful and united country. He noted that Nigerians, wherever they are, have a lot of things in common, especially a deep cultural affiliation that defines them as people of indivisible entity, hence the need to live together in peace and harmony. “We are from the same ancestry. We have a lot of things in common and are closely related with deep cultural affiliation. A Warri man speaks like a typical Yoruba man and this shows that despite the distance between us, we are the same person. “Despite the fact that people moved and settled in different parts of the country, we are connected one way or the other, and this should be the essence of our unity,” the governor noted. Abiodun described the Olu of Warri as a well-brought up person with adequate education to carry out his role as a prominent monarch, expressing the hope that ancient city of Warri and its environs would experience development during his reign. He urged the monarch to use his position as the Olu of Warri to bring about peace in the Niger Delta.
