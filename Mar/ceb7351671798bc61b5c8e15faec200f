Edo State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, to draw the attention of the APC-led Federal Government to the fact that Nigerians have been boxed to a tight corner by their poor management of the nation’s economy, which has led to extremely excruciating living conditions for Nigerians across the country. This is contained in a statement issued yesterday by the acting State Publicity Secretary, Edo State PDP, Dr. Patrick Ojebuoboh.
 
The statement asked the state APC to convey the message to the Federal Government, as it appeared to be unconscious of the difficult times Nigerians live in.
