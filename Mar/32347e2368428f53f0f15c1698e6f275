Manchester City and Manchester United will entertain soccer fans at the Etihad Stadium tomorrow evening. The match billed for 5:30 pm, will be live on SuperSport Premier League (DStv Channel 203). While the Citizens look to be marching to another title, the Red Devils are fighting just to claim a place in next season’s UEFA Champions League and can ill afford a defeat at the hands of their rivals. City manager, Pep Guardiola, has been very happy with his team’s overall performance through the course of this Premier League season, though he says that the level needed to achieve success in the elite divisions is far beyond what he experienced early in his coaching career. “Compared to when I started at Barcelona, it has gone much, much further. The level has improved a lot. The quality, the methodology, the training sessions, the analysis of what exactly the opponent is going to do and what your team can do to punish them,” said Guardiola. “You cannot imagine the hard work that goes in behind the scenes. That is why it is so much more difficult to win games now than when I started 13 or 14 years ago.” United boss Ralf Rangnick, meanwhile, is still working to give his team identity and consistency: “It’s not only about Cristiano Ronaldo. He should score more goals, it’s obvious, but this is not only an issue with Cristiano. It’s an issue with the other players, especially the offensive players. We don’t score enough goals, if you bear in mind how many chances we create, and this is also something that needs to get better in the next couple of weeks.”
