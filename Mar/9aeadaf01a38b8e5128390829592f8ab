Federal Ministry of Aviation has refuted report that Qatar Airways has been chosen as the preferred bidder for Nigeria’s national carrier, Nigeria Air. The report, according to the ministry, came just two days after the issuance of a Request For Proposal published in local and international news media. The ministry said the report is not only false but also capable of discrediting the process for establishment of the airline and discouraging interested parties. A statement signed by Director Public Relation in the ministry, James Odaudu, said: “We wish to state that throughout the process leading to the publication of the Request for Proposal, the guiding principle has been transparency and accountability, which we promised will remain till the final delivery of the project, and by which we stand. “We wish to state categorically that no corporate entity or individual has been appointed or selected, or even preferred for the project, as the process for selection has just started with the Request for Proposal.” It added: “All interested partners and the public are therefore advised to discountenance the report and proceed with their proposals, as we assure them of our unalloyed commitment to transparency and accountability till the end of the process.”
