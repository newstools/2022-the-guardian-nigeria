The Supreme Court has reserved May 27, 2022 to deliver the final judgment in the legal tussle on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State. However, the leadership of the State Executive Committee led by Evan Enwerem, which is believed to be loyal to former Governor Rochas Okorocha, would remain in office to pilot affairs of the party until the court delivers the judgment. Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, who led a five-man panel of justices of the court, had fixed the judgment for Monday, February 28, 2022 after taking arguments for and against the suit. Justice Ariwoola announced that all issues raised in the appeal instituted by the APC would be properly addressed to arrive at a just conclusion.
While adopting his final brief of arguments, Robert Emmukpoeruo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) urged the court to allow the appeal and also prayed the apex court justices to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal in favour of the Enweren leadership. But counsel for Enweren, Albert Amagula, who is the first respondent in the appeal, urged the Supreme Court to affirm the leadership of his client, as the authentic leader of APC in Imo State. Amagula asked the Apex court to dismiss the appeal for lacking in merit and substance and to allow the judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered in favour of the Enwerem leadership Committee. Other respondents in the appeal also asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the APC suit on the ground that it lacked merit and ought to be dismissed.
