It was a magical night of football as fans and consumers celebrated till late hours following the dramatic passage of Real Madrid into the quarterfinal phase of the UEFA Champions League at the expense of Paris Saint Germain. Courtesy of Heineken, fans of the UEFA Champions League were provided with a premium viewing experience at the Golden Tulip Hotel in Asaba, which was a follow up to the same experience a day earlier in Port Harcourt when fans enjoyed Liverpool’s lone goal defeat to Inter Milan. But on Wednesday night, while Karim Benzema scored a hat-trick in 17 minutes to become the match-winner and turn the Galaticos’ fortune around in the quest for the 14th  Champions League title, the real winners were the fans of both sides, who united after the thrilling encounter to enjoy the exhilarating performances from top Hip hop star, Harry Song and Badboy Timz, as well as DJ Alonso. Also present was Shody the Turn Up king, who moderated the session. Aside from the bragging right enjoyed by fans of the winning teams, Heineken also engaged and rewarded fans and consumers at intervals of the match, as well as the end of the match. Without prior notice, fans able to answer correctly some tricky questions like the first corner-kick, free-kick and first yellow card of the match were rewarded with quality Heineken merchandise through a lucky dip. With the ‘Cheers to all Fans Campaign’ in full flight, fans will be looking forward to more rewarding experiences when the last set of second-round second leg matches come up this week today and tomorrow with Manchester United, Atletico Madrid, Ajax, Benfica, Juventus, Villarreal, Lille and Chelsea all in line for the remaining four quarterfinal berths. Heineken, the official sponsor for the UEFA Champions League for over 27 years, has continued to take the lead in offering its consumers and football-loving fans the opportunity to watch live telecasts of all the matches every season.
