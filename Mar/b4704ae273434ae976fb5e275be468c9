Nigeria’s commercial nerve centre, Lagos, ranked first, with Cairo (Egypt) in second position, followed by Nairobi (Kenya) in third position. Morocco’s Casablanca was fourth; Abidjan (Cote d’ Ivoire) fifth and Giza (Egypt) sixth. Abuja (Nigeria) ranked seventh; Accra (Ghana) eight; Kampala (Uganda) in ninth and Rabat (Morocco) is 10th.  
    
A whitepaper, titled: “Towards a flourishing digital economy for all – a spotlight on Africa,” published by Mobile World Live in partnership with the Department for International Trade and collaboration with the Global System for Mobile telecommunications Association (GSMA), which revealed the eCommerce status of the region, noted that across the continent, a cohort of pioneering businesses are already creating a vibrant market for e-commerce. It stated that they have developed innovative solutions to Africa’s challenges around payment, identity and delivery addresses.
   
It revealed that fashion, with 21 per cent order volume, has the highest purchase on the Continent. Beauty products at 15 per cent is second; home and leaving 12 per cent; food delivery 12 per cent; digital services 12 per cent; Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) 10 per cent; phones eight per cent; Electronics seven per cent and others three per cent.  It noted that SSA has the least affordable handsets of any region. The global median cost of the cheapest Internet enabled handset, as a percentage of monthly GDP is 19 per cent. In SSA it is 26.5 per cent.
 
According to the report, one possible solution to this problem is the smart feature phone. It noted that Chinese companies such as Tecno have launched hybrid models, reducing the price of an entry-level Internet enabled handset to $28 in 2020.
 
“Another workaround is pay-by-instalment. Today, a number of schemes offer this purchase method with the innovation that software in the phone will lock it if the subscriber defaults on a payment. Safaricom’s Lipa Mdogo Mdogo programme is an example of this,” it stated.
