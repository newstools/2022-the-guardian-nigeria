Traders under Eko Bridge have 48 hours to vacate area All the squatters living or trading under bridges across Lagos State have been told to leave in seven days or face forceful eviction. The ultimatum was given after an early morning fire razed makeshift shops built under the Apongbon end of Eko Bridge on Wednesday morning. The director of Highways, Bridges and Designs at the Ministry of Works and Housing Engr Oluropo Oyetade, who represented the minister of works Babatunde Fashola during the inspection of the damage caused by the fire to the bridge, said anyone who failed to leave by March 31 would be apprehended and made to pay for the eviction. Oyetade said the eviction of all illegal occupants under bridges across Lagos would be done in collaboration with Lagos State Government. He claimed there was ongoing discussion to eject those trading and living under bridges before the fire accident. However, Lagos State Government said those who have shops under Eko Bridge only have 48 hours to vacate the area. “The issue of fire outbreak under the Eko Bridge at Oke Arin may become endemic if adequate steps are not taken to forestall future occurrence due to negligence and non-adherence to safety protocols by traders, leaders of the market associations and CDAs after several engagements on the need to take issues of safety seriously,” the Special Adviser to Lagos State Governor on Central Business Districts, Mr. Gbenga Oyerinde, said. Oyerinde decried the illegal activities of traders who store items beneath the bridge and engage in other business transactions, warning that anyone caught flouting the directive to stay clear of underneath the bridge will be arrested and prosecuted.
