This, people in the past, recognised and appreciated. In some of the stories behind the sculptures, you will find tales of women who paid the ultimate sacrifice. Statue of Liberty Taking the number 1 spot is the Statue of Liberty. Dedicated in 1886 and sculpted by Frederic Bartholdi, this female statue gifted by the French to the US represents the friendship between France and the United States, including the recognition of America’s acceptance of immigrants and refugees. The Statue of Liberty museum also adds that this statue was a symbol of the end of slavery. It is said that the statue is sculpted after the Roman goddess of liberty, Libertas. On her left hand, is a table containing the date of the US declaration of Independence. On her right hand is a torch. While a broken shackle is visible on her legs. Little-Mermaid-statue.-Photo-Scandification The Little Mermaid Take a tour to Copenhagen, where the image of a little mermaid sits atop a rock in the water at Langelinie Pier. Constructed in honour of the 1800s, Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the bronze and granite statue, represents a little mermaid sitting and longing for her prince to come to her after she has given everything all up for him on land. It is also said to be a symbol of gender equality- where women are taught to take their place in a men’s world, especially in the absence of a father. This sculpture by Edvard Eriksen was commissioned by Carl Jacobsen who was enchanted with the story after watching ballerina Ellen Price, the main character in The Little Mermaid ballet in 1909. Unfortunately, it has been vandalised numerous times.

The Battle of Stalingrad was the bloodiest war during the 2nd World War, leading to about 2 million total casualties, with the Soviet Union emerging victorious against the Germans. To highlight this victory, the 279 feet sculpture shows a woman holding a raised sword. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1683864 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-400x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1912" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-400x598.jpg 400w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-771x1152.jpg 771w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-1028x1536.jpg 1028w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-1371x2048.jpg 1371w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-161x240.jpg 161w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-321x480.jpg 321w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-402x600.jpg 402w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/National-Womens-Monument-Vrouemonument.-Photo-Picasa-scaled.jpg 1714w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> National Women’s Monument The National Women’s Monument or the Vrouemonument in Bloemfontein is important to the people of South Africa, as it is a tribute to the 27,000 women who died in the British concentration camps during the 2nd Boer War. The sculpture by Van Wouw shows a helpless woman with her dying child in her lap while another woman seeks help from the Lord. An anti-war activist, Emily Hobhouse, played a huge role as her ideas served as an inspiration.
