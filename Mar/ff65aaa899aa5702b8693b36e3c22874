No fewer than 20, 000 members of the African Peoples Alliance (APA), Enugu State Chapter, have joined the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) ahead of the 2023 general elections. The Chairman of APA in the state, Mr Chukwunonso Ogbe disclosed this on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu. Ogbe, who had been the major financier of the party in the state, said that the decision was reached during an enlarged meeting of the State Executive Committee of APA. The chairman said that the move was part of ongoing realignment of political forces by members of opposition parties in the state. He said that the choice of APGA as their preferred destination was the fact that the party was not only progressive but represented the ideals of the people of the area. “During an enlarged exco meeting of APA which held in Enugu, the leaders and stakeholders of our party in the state agreed to defect to APGA. “We also agreed to mobilise all members and supporters of APA in the 17 local government councils of the state for the defection. “This defection into APGA is for the purpose of enthroning a formidable opposition force in Enugu State in view of the 2023 general elections,” he said. Ogbe said that it had become necessary for politicians of like minds in the state to come under a single political platform against forces of retrogression in the state. “The 2023 election will mark the liberation of Enugu State from poor governance and return it to the masses. “The defection of members of APA to APGA is the beginning of such steps to be taken to give the people of the state a better platform to actualise their dream of a better society,” he said. Ogbe said that the formal defection would be on March 19, 2022 at the APGA state secretariat in Enugu.
