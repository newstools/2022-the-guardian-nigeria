As preparations for the 2023 general elections take shape on the platforms of the two major political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), fans of Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, have urged political stakeholders not to make the mistake of electing President Muhammadu Buhari’s successor on sentiments of ethnicity and zoning.
 
Although there are debates over the issue of zoning in the ruling APC, where Bello and his adherents belong, those who believe in the Kogi State Governor’s capacity to lead the country, say his “presidential ambition transcends zoning, which some powers-that-be have been trying to play up against the interest of the country.”  “Bello is much more capable to replicate the magic of Kogi State, which is more or less a confluence state where all ethnic nationals in Nigeria are well represented if elected president. We have never heard of any ethnic uprising since Bello emerged governor in 2015.”
 
The Kogi State, Chief of Staff, Abdulkareem Asuku and the state Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, recently said on different occasions that Kogi, under Governor Bello, is a state where ethnic rivalry is alien to the citizens.
 
This indeed is what Nigeria must conquer if it hopes to thrive. Call Governor Bello a Yoruba, Ibo, Hausa or Fulani or rather refer to him as Alhaji or Pastor Yahaya, his disposition in governance in the last seven years never betrayed any sentiment towards any of these directions.
