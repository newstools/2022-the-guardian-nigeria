The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), Nigeria, has called for the creation of equal opportunities for women within the logistics and transport supply chain and other sectors. The President of CILT, Mfon Usoro, stated this in her message to mark International Women’s Day yesterday, with the theme: “Break the Bias.” She lamented that negative stereotypes and biases, both overt and unconscious against women that are exhibited in various forms through overt discrimination and abuse as well as subtle innuendoes, have together resulted in the narrowing of prospects for growth to the female folks. According to her, there is the need to help women attain their goals as many of them have continued to rise above the bias by shattering various glass ceilings along the way.
Usoro said the world must not fail to acknowledge and be inspired by the giant progress women have achieved in today’s world while celebrating women who have risen to the pinnacle of their careers and those who are still climbing regardless of the biases. “Gender equality, the fight against harmful stereotypes and bias is not a female-only struggle. We want an equal, fair, inclusive society for all. We encourage the men who have been on the sidelines or view the struggle with amusement to join us in challenging stereotypes and breaking biases. “Many female members of CILT are illustrious, accomplished career women and would never have reached those heights had we placed limits on what we thought we could achieve,” she stated. She, however, urged women to create opportunities for themselves, exploit available opportunities, invest in developing and promoting the visibility of their skills. “On behalf of the female members of CILT, Nigeria, we celebrate the strength and tenacity of women all over the world in the face of the many biases that we have encountered and continue to encounter because we are women,” she stated.
