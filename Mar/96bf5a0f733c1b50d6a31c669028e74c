Bayelsa State Governor, Senator Douye Diri, has inaugurated a new internal road and a secondary school in Obogoro community in Yenagoa Council of the state. Speaking during the inauguration of the projects, Diri recalled how pathetic the road and school were during his previous visit to the area, a condition he said necessitated the decision of the government to embark on the projects. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, quoted the governor as saying his administration will continue to deliver on its promises to bring development to people of the state. He commended the paramount ruler and people of the community for their support for government and ensuring that projects were hitch-free, saying such support would be rewarded with more projects. The state’s helmsman also stated that the erosion control project in the community had commenced and assured that the government would ensure it was completed to specification.  He expressed optimism that by the time the project is completed, the issue of erosion would be a thing of the past in Obogoro. While inaugurating the new classroom block at the Community Secondary School, Obogoro, Diri described education as the best legacy any government could bequeath to the younger generation. He assured that his administration was committed to development of the education sector. He directed the Commissioner for Education to ensure that another classroom block, a science and laboratory block and perimeter fencing were constructed as well as engaging of security guards to stem insecurity in the area. He said: “We call on every other community to be friendly. So far, all communities where roads have been constructed have been supportive. We will build more roads that we can use at all seasons.” Earlier, the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Moses Teibowei, said the 350-metre single carriage road was a footpath that was difficult to access by the students and the people of the community.
