• Headline inflation rose marginally to 15.7 per cent in February
• Figures deceptive, politically influenced, Owoh insists
• Experts seek removal of import duties on imported petroleum products 
• Resuscitate moribund refineries to boost availability, FG urged 
• Last year’s trade deficit hits N1.94tr, 96% higher than that of 2020 Rising energy costs both in electricity and fuel segments, geopolitical tension and fiscal indiscipline have triggered fresh concern over fast-rising prices even as headline inflation rose marginally to 15.7 per cent in February, 0.1 per cent higher than the January figure.
   
The latest inflation data were contained in the February consumer price index (CPI) released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), yesterday. 
  
But a professor of applied economics, Godwin Owoh, balked at the reliability of the data, insisting the aggregation might be mathematically correct but cannot be empirically proven.	 
   
The economists, who warned that the crisis in the energy market suggests that the days ahead could be tougher than what has been experienced in recent years, said the inflation data may doctored to achieve a predetermined political objective.  MEANWHILE, the country’s trade deficit continues to widen. Last year, the country posted a trade deficit of N1.94 trillion.    
According to the breakdown of foreign trade statistics released yesterday, of the N39.75 trillion total trade value recorded last year, exports accounted for 48 per cent while import was valued at 52 per cent.
   
Last year’s trade deficit was wider than that of 2020 in percentage and absolute terms. It was 96 per cent higher than 178.3 billion recorded in 2020.
   
In 2020 also, the total exports accounted for 49.6 per cent of the value of foreign trade, which was N25.2 trillion.  Until 2020, Nigeria’s trade balance was positive. In 2018 and 2019, for instance, the figures stood at N5.37 trillion and N2.23 trillion respectively. Experts said the widening trade deficit is partly responsible for fiscal challenges currently faced.
