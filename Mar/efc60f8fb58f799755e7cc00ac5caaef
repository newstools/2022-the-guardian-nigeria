Debuting the same day Kim Kardashian was declared legally single, Eazy includes a scene where the Donda rapper buries what appears to be an animated version of Davidson. Featuring The Game, West raps on the song, “God saved me from the crash, just so I can beat Pete Davidson’s ass.” Kanye West is seen dragging a body tied up by ropes with a bag over the head, and when he pulls off the bag, animated Pete’s face is revealed as West sprinkles some seeds over him. These seeds spring up into roses which are loaded into the back of a pickup. Many fans have identified this scene’s connection to the truckload of roses Kanye sent his estranged wife on Valentine’s Day. He takes another jab at the Skim’s founder new man in the last three frames of the video. The frames read, “EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER / EXCEPT SKETE YOU KNOW WHO / JK HE’S FINE.” Kanye West has been very public with his obvious dislike for Davidson, taking several jabs at him on social media. In fact, Kim Kardashian, while filing to be declared legally single, mentioned that these posts had caused her “emotional distress”.
