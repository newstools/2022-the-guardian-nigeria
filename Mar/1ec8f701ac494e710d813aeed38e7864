The soup is a precise balance of sweet and spicy blend of ground nuts, onions and tomatoes. The added flavour to the soup is enriched with local flavours, leaf vegetables and protein of choice, but in this case beef. This soup can be served with a swallow(morsel) of choice. But let’s first begin the cooking. Ingredients Method Omisagwe is ready to be served with any morsel/swallow of choice. Enjoy!!!
