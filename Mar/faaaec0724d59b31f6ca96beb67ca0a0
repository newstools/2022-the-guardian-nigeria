Nigeria’s U-20 girls, Falconets yesterday in Benin City earned a ticket to the 2022 FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup, after a comfortable 4-1 win over their counterparts from Senegal, for a 7-2 aggregate victory. First leg heroine, Flourish Sebastine was again the cynosure, scoring a brace, in the 8th and 19th minutes to denude the visitors of any hope of a dramatic comeback at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium. Sebastine cruised to a hat-trick at the Stade Lat-Dior in Thies two weeks ago and was not to be stopped in the Edo State capital, whipping the ball into the net after only eight minutes to compound the situation for the Senegal girls. Midfielder, Esther Onyenezide made it three on 25 minutes after converting from the penalty spot. However, just as they did at home in Senegal, the Young Lionesses of Teranga scored from the spot as well, putting away from six yards after one of their strikers was upended in the Nigerian box. In the second half, the Falconets sat comfortably on the game and allowed it to run their way, taking things easy and cutting off the few onslaughts of the visitors. Just before the final whistle of Eswatini referee Letticia Antonella Viana, Joy Jerry made it four for the two-time FIFA World Cup runners-up. The result sends the Falconets straight to the World Cup holding August between 10th – 28th in Costa Rica, and is a positive development just 72 hours before the Super Eagles go big for Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup ticket against the Black Stars of Ghana in Abuja. The Eagles and the Black Stars ended the first leg encounter 0-0 at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi on Friday evening, with the return starting at 6 pm inside the Moshood Abiola Stadium on Tuesday.
