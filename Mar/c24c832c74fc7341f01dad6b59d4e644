The director, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center (WARDC) Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi has urged governments at all levels to commit enough funds to ensure that Gender-Based Violence (GBV) is properly addressed. Afolabi stated this on Tuesday in Abuja at a book launch by the Center for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID) titled ‘Gender-Based Violence reporting handbook’ as part of activities to mark this year’s international women’s day. She called on the government at all levels to strengthen the capacity of media on ethical reporting of GBV cases without relying only on information provided by police sources. Afolabi also said that perpetrators should be named and shamed as the fear of exposure is more effective than jail terms in some cases noting that if the media can bring the spotlight on violators of women and girls, a lot of changes will be made. According to her “intensify advocacy for the adoption of Violence Against Persons (Prohibition) Acts and Child Right Acts across all states in Nigeria and public budget allocation for implementation of the laws. “Enhance synergy among the actors responding to GBV cases and response sectors, like the police, CSOs, media, ministries, department and agencies”. Earlier in his address, acting executive director CJID, Dr Tobi Oluwatola said acts of violence against women is seen in almost all spheres of society adding that GBV is something that needs to be tackled so the centre is strengthening the media to do a more diligent job of holding people in power to account. He further said this will enable the country to build a sustainable democracy that is inclusive and deliver that value of sustainable development.
