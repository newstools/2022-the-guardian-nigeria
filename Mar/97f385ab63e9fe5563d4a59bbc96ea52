The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has called for the signing of the two Memoranda of Understanding between Nigeria and China in an effort to boost tourism between the two countries.
  
The Minister, who made the call in Abuja on Thursday, when he received the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr. Chui Jian Chun, on a courtesy visit to his office, said the two MoU are on the Facilitation of Group Travels by Chinese Tourists to Nigeria as well as Travel Facilitation through the Approved Destination Status (ADS). He said Nigeria, like China, has huge tourism attractions to give effect to the MoU, adding that if just 1 per cent of the 130 million Chinese tourists who travel annually comes to Nigeria, that will be 1.3 million tourists, which will be a big boost to tourism in Nigeria. “Though the two MoU date back to 2019, they have not been signed. It is important that our two countries work together to negotiate and sign these MoU to promote tourism between them.”  “I want to use this opportunity to appeal to Your Excellency to continue to use your good offices to fast-track the evaluation and approval process of the loan by the
China Export Import Bank, and to thank you for your efforts so far in this regard.”
  
In his remarks, Ambassador Chui said China is re-strategising its bilateral relations with Nigeria to focus on Growth, Development and Progress.
  
He said: “The new strategy, tagged 5 GIST will be a holistic, complete and sustained approach to focus on political support, economic cooperation, security and military collaboration, international affairs coordination, infrastructure, ICT, industry, investment, import and export, among others.”
  
The Ambassador further said the new focus would be anchored on people-to-people communication and relationship as well as cultural exchanges.
