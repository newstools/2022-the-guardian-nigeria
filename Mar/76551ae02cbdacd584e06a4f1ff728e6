Kyari said as an oil company and enabler organisation, NNPCL was determined to boost power generation and supply to Nigerian homes through increased investment, hence, it had signed a contract with China Machinery Engineering Company (CME) and General Electric, (GE) to provide 50MW of electricity to Maiduguri, Borno State.

The GMD added that renowned and reputable audit firms would carry out the planned audit. Earlier, Director-General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Alex A.
