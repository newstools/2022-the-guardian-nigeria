The singer was scheduled to headline the second day of Paraguay’s Asunciónico festival, which is holding for the first time since 2019 as a result of covid. Taking to social media, the singer wrote, “Our plane was caught in a major unexpected storm and struck by lighting.”   A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) “My crew, band, friends and family who were all traveling with me are safe after an emergency landing. We were unfortunately unable to fly into Paraguay.” Sharing video footage of the lightning flashing outside the red-eye flight’s window, the Wrecking Ball singer also shared a frightening shot of the damage it did to the plane, nothing that everyone was safe. Cyrus has been on a South America tour and just recently finished her latest show in Bogotá, Colombia. She has also shared pictures and videos from the tour on social media. However, it still remains unclear whether or not she’ll make it in time for her appearance. Paraguayan news outlet Extra had anticipated that Cyrus’ arrival would draw fans to the country’s Silvio Pettirossi International Airport. Asunciónico organizers cancelled the festival’s opening day after Asunción, Paraguay’s capital city, experienced massive flooding and rainfall on Tuesday. Festival officials are expected also to announce whether the weather conditions will allow Wednesday’s performances to go on as planned.
