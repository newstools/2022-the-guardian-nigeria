The university must be the guardian of reason, inquiry, and philosophical openness, offering rational and timely criticism in areas of public policy, social and economic life. The purpose of the university must go beyond awarding degrees and conducting research. The university must be the catalyst for the socio-economic advancement and improved health of the society, and for the health and economic security of the nation.
 
At this point, let us take a critical review of where we are as a nation. Is Nigeria a developed nation or an underdeveloped nation? We all know we are not a developed nation, and we will vehemently resist being classed as an underdeveloped nation. We prefer to be inoffensively called a developing nation. The truth is that no nation, whether developed or underdeveloped, is static. We are all developing, none is static. You are either forward marching into the progress of a better life, or sliding backwards, retrogressing, but not static.
 
There is no doubt that human development is anchored on relevant science and technology, and development in human society is a many-sided process. Development, which may be defined as the capacity to live a more satisfactory life through exploiting the resources of nature, is not limited to any one group, country, or continent. In our individual way, we have strived to live a better life through the exploitation of our resources. How successful we are in development, depends upon the extent to which we understand the laws of nature, that is, science and on the extent to which we put that understanding into practice by devising tools, that is, technology.  The level of understanding science and the level of applying the understanding of science, separate the “developed” from the “underdeveloped”.
