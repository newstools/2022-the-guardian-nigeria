The Senate on Wednesday passed two bills to establish a Federal University in the Federal Capital Territory and Rivers. This followed the adoption of reports of the Senate Committee on Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND at Committee of the Whole. Presenting the report, Sen. Sandy Onuh, Vice Chairman of the Committee, said the bill for FCT University of Science and Technology, Abaji, would provide the legal framework for the institution to close the knowledge gap in science and technology in the territory. “The bill to establish the Federal University of Environmental Technology would allow for academic and professional programmes leading to the award of first degrees, postgraduate degrees, and diplomas with special emphasis on environmental technology and research,” he said.
