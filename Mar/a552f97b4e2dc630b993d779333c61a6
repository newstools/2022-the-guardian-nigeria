One of them, Justice Muawiyah Baba Idris of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory FCT Abuja was issued a warning letter and placed on the council’s watchlist for a period of one year. He was indicted for signing the Writ of Possession for execution on the same day he delivered judgment in suit No. FCT/HC/CV/FT/36/19 between Sicons Nigeria Ltd V Nile Place Restaurant and Catering Services Ltd.
