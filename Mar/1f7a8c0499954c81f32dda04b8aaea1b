More than four years after the Lagos State government started the reconstruction of the Ketu Garage, the project is still far from completion. Many transporters who operate within the facility, at the commencement of the reconstruction work, applauded the former Lagos State governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, for the initiative, especially with the promise that it would be fitted with modern facilities upon completion. They expressed surprise that the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration has not deemed it fit to complete the project more than two years since coming on board. Presently, the whole garage is in a deplorable state, even as commuters and bus drivers have resigned themselves to fate. When The Guardian visited the garage yesterday, its entire length and breadth was covered with cellophane paper and pet bottles. While a section of it has been converted to a praying ground, another section has been made into a makeshift rest house using the interlocking stones that were meant for the completion of the garage. Traders in the facility are also using the interlocking stones as support structures to display their wares.
When approached for comments, the transporters declined, claiming that state government would chase them away from the abandoned garage if they dare to criticise it over the abandonment. But one Tunji Lawal, claimed that the non-completion of the garage was not affecting his operation. He said transport union workers, not drivers were well placed to comment on reasons behind the abandonment of the facility by the current administration.
