The acceptability of blockchain has continued to grow globally as an evolving technology for future financial solutions.  Blockchain technology is a structure that stores transactional records, also known as the block, of the public in several databases, known as the “chain,” in a network connected through peer-to-peer nodes. The technology is fast becoming the trend in E-commerce and one of the major global actors driving the innovation is Oyemonlan Benjamin Oseoje, better known as Trillbjm, a cerebral young entrepreneur. Trillbjm, the incredibly innovative tech expert, has no equal in creating tailor-made solutions in crypto wallet and exchange. The Nigerian recently built the first bitcoin debit card in Africa, and he has been dubbed as the ‘youngest’ and most innovative ‘chief technical officer’ in Africa. Oseoje, who was born and raised in Lagos, facilitates wide adoption of cryptocurrency in West Africa by infusing financial technology and value added services into the blockchain. “I’m a huge fan of solving real-life problems,” he said during a recent interview at a social event. “I first identify a problem I may have at a particular time, I then think of a viable solution. If I can solve that problem, I try to amplify it enough to reach other people who, like me, require the solution. This is my secret tool.” This is why Trillbjm is so critical to the operations of Patricia, an alternative payment solutions company that facilitates the easy use of cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions, where he serves as the CTO. Trillbjm also serves in the same capacity in other digital companies, which include Gloverapp, Nigeria’s leading gift card exchanger; Hankdevice, a Bluetooth product for locating lost devices, and Rooomxix, a luxury wear store.
