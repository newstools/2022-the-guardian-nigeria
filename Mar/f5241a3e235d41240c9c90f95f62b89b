Arsenal stars could earn bonuses worth around £500,000 if they return to the Champions League next season, according to reports talksports.com. The north Londoners have not participated in Europe’s elite competition since the 2016/17 campaign, but are currently on course for a top-four finish. The Gunners‘ players, though, will have extra reason to ensure they do finish in the top-four as they will be given a cash reward. Qualifying for next season’s Champions League is worth around £50 million in prize money and broadcasting revenue with a portion of this paid out to the players on a pro-rata basis if they make it into the tournament. The Daily Mail also claim that some Arsenal players have clauses written in their deals that could see their weekly wages increase automatically once the club return to the Champions League. Arsenal made a poor start to the season by losing their opening three league games and sat bottom of the Premier League.
Mikel Arteta’s side are now, though, in pole position to claim fourth spot after beating Watford last weekend after a turnaround in their form. But rivals Tottenham, West Ham and Manchester United are all completing with the Gunners for a top four place. Securing Champions League next season would also give the club a major boost in their attempts to keep Bukayo Saka, who has two years remaining in his current contract, at the club. The academy graduate has been linked with a move to Liverpool and an extension to Arsenal’s Champions League absence could make him consider his future. Meanwhile, a top-four finish could help the club improve their attacking options next summer, with Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah contracts expiring at the end of this season.
