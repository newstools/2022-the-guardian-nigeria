Former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, on Wednesday received the endorsement of the House of Representatives caucus of the All Progressives Congress to contest the 2023 presidential poll. House Leader, Alhassan Doguwa, who moderated the endorsement and spoke on behalf of the members, got not a single “nay” voice when he called for the votes of those against Tinubu’s ambition. “Bola Ahmed Tinubu has everything it takes to be the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, comes 2023″, he stated, as he rounded off his address to the visiting APC national leader,” Doguwa said Tinubu had earlier paid a courtesy call on the House speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, at his office before proceeding to meet with the caucus. Addressing the lawmakers, the former Lagos State governor said he visited the caucus to seek members’ support to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. “I am here to seek your support for my life-long ambition,” Tinubu said. “To step into the shoes of President Buhari in 2023, and not to step on his shoes.” Tinubu spoke much about the fact that he was the only person who had come out in the open, running around to tell everyone that he would contest the presidential election, an indication that he remained the most serious, most qualified, most experienced and most prepared to offer service to the nation and Nigerians. Speaking earlier to welcome Tinubu to the meeting, Gbajabiamila told his colleagues that nobody else had shown genuine interest or campaigned to be president next year apart from Tinubu. “No one else is contesting but one man, Bola Ahmed Tinubu,” the Gbajabiamila said. He also described Tinubu’s visit as “epic” and “historic,” being the first presidential aspirant to visit the House to seek the support of members.
