Alake of Egba land, Oba Adedotun Aremu Gbadebo, yesterday, applauded the efforts of the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba land, Iba Gani Abiodun Ige Adams for championing the cause for the promotion of Yoruba culture and tradition. The paramount ruler said Adams has used the Olokun Festival Foundation to drive the tourism potentials of Abeokuta, and Ogun state generally. Oba Gbadebo spoke at the 2022 edition of Olumo festival held at the Olumo Rock, Ikija, Abeokuta, Ogun State. He said the economic sector of Abe-Okuta received a big boost with over 50,000 dignitaries, including members of the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC). “I want to commend Aare Gani Adams for his courage to project the cultural identity of Yoruba race and that of the Egba people. “He has used his platform to drive the tourism potentials of Abeokuta and Ogun State in general by bringing over 50,000 participants to Olumo festival annually. His spirit of consistency is unrivaled and I appreciate his courage.” Meanwhile, Adams has restated his belief in sustaining the cultural identity of the Yoruba race. He said: “Promotion of Yoruba culture and festivals across the southwest is part of the tools for the liberation of Yoruba race.” He urged all traditional rulers in the region to perform their statutory roles as custodians of culture and tradition. “There are several spiritual benefits we derive from celebrating these festivals. We have also used these festivals as part of our sacrifices to the deities in order to connect to the spiritual realm.” He maintained that insecurity has taken a huge toll on all sectors in Nigeria, saying no sector has been spared with the rising scourge. “The rising spate of insecurity across the country can only be tackled with state or regional police, which is one of the contents of restructuring.”
