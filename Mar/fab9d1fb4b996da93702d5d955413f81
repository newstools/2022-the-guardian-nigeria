Happening in less than a week, the street party is a celebration of Abuja creatives who embody the Keep Walking mantra. Tunes from Zinoleesky, Ajebo Hustlers, Magixx, Psycho YP, Zilla Oaks, Odumodu Black, Tomi Obanure while vibing with Dj Titanium, Dj Romie and Maze X Mxtreme accompanied by the finest blend of whisky in the company of fine creative minds, is an experience we definitely don’t want to miss.
