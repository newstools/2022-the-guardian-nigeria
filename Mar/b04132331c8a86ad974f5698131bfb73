Mrs. Bolatito Adegoke, a widow to Timothy Adegoke, the late postgraduate student of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, who was allegedly murdered at Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Ile-Ife, where he lodged, yesterday, broke down in tears, when she was called to enter into the witness dock for the commencement of the murder trial at Osun State High Court sitting in Osogbo.
    
Bolatito, the first prosecutor’s witness, who was led in evidence by the prosecutor, narrated how her late husband, Timothy Adegoke, left home on November 5, 2021, for his final examination at OAU, before he lodged at Hilton Hotels and Resorts, Ile-Ife.  “My husband used to call me before he went for the examination, but on Saturday, November 6, 2021, I did not see his call.
 
“I called him more than three times. I was worried and I told my children and started weeping because the issue of kidnapping is rampant in Nigeria.  Counsel to the defendants, Kunle Adegoke and K. K Eleja, had last week argued the bail applications of all the defendants, which were opposed by the prosecuting counsel, M O Omosun.
