The National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) has approved new courses at the National Institute for Sports (NIS), even as the institution now admits students through the Joint Admission Matriculation Board (JAMB) effective from September 2022. A letter of approval signed by NBTE Acting Director of Programmes, Monotechnic, Samaila Ila Tanko, on behalf of the Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), reads: “I am directed to inform you that the National Institute for Sports, Surulere, Lagos  was visited on January 26 to 29, 2022 for resources inspection of the following  programmes: ND Sports Coaching and Training,  ND Sports Management. “Approval has, therefore, been granted to the two courses with streams of 40 and 60 students respectively. The two programmes will be due for full accreditation in 2023.” Towards the implementation of the process, the NBTE also enjoined both JAMB and the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) to include the NIS in their brochures and schemes forthwith. NBTE also advised the NIS to invite the body for final accreditation approval when all steps had been taken. President Muhammadu Buhari, through the recommendation of Youth and Sports Development Minister, Sunday Dare, had appointed Professor Olawale Moronkola as NIS Director and he assumed duties on September 20, 2021 with a clear mandate to reposition it to compete with other sports Institutes around the world. With just six months in the saddle, Professor Moronkola has begun the process with infrastructural and human capital development that has won him wide acclaim. Only last month, the Nigerian University Games Association (NUGA) commended the director general for upgrading facilities at the Institute within such a short period.
