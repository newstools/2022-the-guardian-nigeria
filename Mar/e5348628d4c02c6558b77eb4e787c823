Super Eagles goalkeeper trainer, Alloy Agu, has said that there will be no automatic shirt for Madoka Okoye, Francis Uzoho, Daniel Akpeyi and other players listed for the Qatar 2022 World Cup final qualifier against the Black Stars of Ghana on Friday. Speaking with The Guardian yesterday, Agu stated that the technical crew had put behind the mistakes that happened at Cameroun 2022 AFCON, adding that much emphasis would be put on the goalkeeping position to get the best person for the game against Ghana. The former Super Eagles goalie noted that the present Eagles formation is geared towards getting all the goalkeepers to fight for shirt ahead of every game. He said that goalkeeper for every match is picked base on current form and ability to convince the coaches during training. Agu, however, added that the coaches are not under pressure following reports of injuries sustained by some players listed for the game. He assured that the technical crew is 100 percent focused in raising a formidable squad for the match. “We have learnt our lesson at the Cameroun AFCON. We have just four days to train ahead of the match, and any goalkeeper that prove he can get the number one shirt in training, will be used for the Ghana tie. There is no sentiment about it. “Coaches always select players base on their current form and fitness level. The Eagles technical crew are experienced enough to get a good replacement for any injured player ahead of the match, so there should be no fear in any quarter,” he said. Meanwhile, the Super Eagles camp will open on Monday in Abuja.
