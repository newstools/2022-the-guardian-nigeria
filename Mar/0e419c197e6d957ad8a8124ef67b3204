How does it feel to sit at the VIP box of the legendary San Siro stadium, wear a nice suit, and see the player you have discovered when he was just 15, Mavis Tchibota, go up against Romelu Lukaku and Christian Eriksen? You can ask Stari’s Founder, Mr. Avi Zioni. The most incredible part – he didn’t have any scouting background! Avi was a regular fan, watching football games on television and loving statistics, but most importantly, knowing who will become an amazing player, because he had an eye for identifying talent. Who says you can’t do the same?

If I don’t have a lot of time, but love football and want to make money out of it? Stari has a new mobile app, currently exclusive to Africa, where players can create profiles and upload football videos, to be rated by thousands of fans. Any parent, friend, or player himself, can see the benefits in using the app. Footballers with top ratings will be noticed by hundreds of scouts and have professional trials in Europe. Fans who identified the talents have the benefits of rewards like cash prizes, flights to games in Europe, job opportunities and access to the next football stars. What if I want to become a professional scout? Another Stari feature is our Master Scouting Course. We have invested many resources to promote African football by building this study program – to help fans learn to be scouts, become professionals, and advance their careers. The course is presented by scouts and other professionals, working for the biggest football clubs in the world, and who discovered amazing talents over their careers. After the course, you will get job opportunities, connections to clubs and a free subscription to the Stari Pro platform. What is the Stari Pro platform? On Stari Pro platform, professional scouts and fan-scouts, called Commando Scouts, are watching games from under-the-radar leagues and tournaments. After spotting the best undiscovered young talents, they write and submit analytical reports. These reports are judged by Stari’s professional committee, formed by veteran scouts, sport directors and journalists. The best scouts are awarded points with which they can win amazing prizes, like big financial rewards or flying out to watch Champions League matches. The best prize of all? Full time scouting job at Stari or in one of Stari’s partner clubs in Europe. How is Stari different?
