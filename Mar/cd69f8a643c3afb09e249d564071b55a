The so-called ‘fraternal squabble’ between two neighbours, as President Vladimir Putin profiled it, is nestling an overarching effect on the global community. Besides the devious geopolitical dynamics that triggered the Russia-Ukraine conflict in the first place, countries several miles away can feel the pinch on local economies. It is for this reason that Nigeria should show more pragmatic interests in the crisis, know where it stands in the power dynamics and with foresight, begin to make preparations to address emerging fallouts of the war.  From Ukraine, Nigeria imports iron ore for the production of steel and primary manufacturing hardware. Both Russia and Ukraine are the largest exporters of durum wheat to Nigeria. Durum wheat is used in the production of flour for bread and noodles.
