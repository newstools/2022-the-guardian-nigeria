The Keeping Up With The Kim Kardashian star removed her ‘West’ from her Instagram and Twitter pages, returning back to her maiden name in the early hours of Friday morning. This change comes just the Skims Founder’s appeal to be declared legally single was approved by a judge on Wednesday. Appearing online during the bifurcation hearing on Tuesday, the Kardashian’s request was granted three months after she filed for a change in her marital status. In a statement on Tuesday, her estranged husband Kanye West had said in a statement, “I’ve asked my team to expedite the dissolution of my marriage to Kim so I can put my entire attention to our beautiful children.” Kim Kardashian had filed for a divorce in early 2021, and in December, she filed to be declared legally single, writing, “I very much desire to be divorced.” She also said she’d asked Kanye to keep their divorce private, which he hadn’t, and his social media posts had caused “emotional distress.”
