On March 17, Prof. Charles Soludo was administered oath-of-office to become the fifth governor of Anambra state having been returned by the INEC Returning Officer in the Anambra state governorship poll held on November 6 and 9, 2021. By implication, the state has again successfully transited from one democratic government to another. However, as a tradition for desperate politicians, some gladiators despite losing transparently to Soludo are testing their luck as Plan-B at the election tribunal. From the inauguration speech, Soludo has taken full charge and supposedly worked to bring to bear experiences garnered over the years particularly in the financial sector as apex bank helmsman. Observably, the new governor understands that his four-year tenure counts, thus no time to waste let alone get distracted.
 
Apart from his manifesto, expectations on Soludo are very high that it will take prudence to actualise. The luck Soludo has is that he is used to single-mindedness when on important tasks not minding who will be adversely affected as long as objectivity is on course. Recall that during his tenure as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Soludo initiated the first banks consolidation exercise that swept many bank managing directors, executive directors, top management staff and other personnel out of jobs as a result of the bar raised by CBN leading to mergers to meet up. At the end, stronger and more efficient banks were born. And after his exit, his successors have continued to sustain the momentum. It submits that Soludo is a strong-minded reformer.
