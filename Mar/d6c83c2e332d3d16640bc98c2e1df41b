Taking to social media, the wrestler announcing his divorce and new relationship wrote, “Yo Maniacs just for the record, the Facebook and Instagram posts are of me and my girlfriend Sky, I am officially divorced, sorry I thought everyone already knew, love my Maniacs4Life”. TMZ reports that legal documents of the divorce settlement require Hogan to buy McDaniel within 45 days with the guarantee that she makes zero payments on the vehicle. While the paperwork fails to address the car’s make and model, this purchase allows Hugan keep the ride they shared while married. The document also allows McDaniel to retain ownership of a property they bought together in Palm Isle, FL, while Hogan holds on to his Clearwater mansion. Hogan also paid an undisclosed one-time lump sum of cash, and the settlement includes a non-disparagement clause that prevents each of them from talking about the relationship without the other signing off. Hogan filed for divorce in October 2021, and the divorce was finalised in the same year.
