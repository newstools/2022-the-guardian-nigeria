Former Lagos State governor Bola Tinubu Wednesday afternoon met All Progressives Congress (APC) senators at the National Assembly. The APC national leader said he is seeking counsel, partnership, and support from lawmakers for his presidential bid. Tinubu said the presidential elections scheduled for February next year cannot be won by his efforts alone. He asked that the federal lawmakers support and help him get nominated so he can succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. Senate President Ahmed Lawan, in his response, said the APC Senate caucus is a major pillar of the party and has shown loyalty and commitment to the ideals of the party. He told Tinubu that in the course of fighting for the unity of the party the lawmakers are with him.
