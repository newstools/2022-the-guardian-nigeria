The Nigeria Cycling National team is aiming to pick the Paris 2024 Olympics ticket at the CAC Road Cycling African Championship holding in Egypt. The championship, which began on March 23, will end on March 28 at Sharm El- Sheikh in Cairo, Egypt. The Nigeria Cycling Federation is optimistic that Team Nigeria will excel at the CAC Road Cycling African Championship. According to the Federation, the Nigeria Cycling team, initially made up of eight athletes, was reduced to two representatives due to lack of funds. The cyclists representing Nigeria are Badamasi Adamu and Gabriel John Odumu. Afrinergia Power Limited and FT Cycle Care sponsored them to the African tournament. Chairman of FT Cycle Care, Femi Thomas, explained that the sponsorship include cost of flight tickets, PCR test and visa fee, adding that the host Nation Egypt made provision for accommodation and feeding for all participants.
