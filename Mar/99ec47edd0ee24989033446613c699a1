Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) General Secretary, Dr Mohammed Sanusi in a statement said the two-year contract offered to Eguavoen has been withdrawn. “Following the failure of the Super Eagles of Nigeria to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the erstwhile Technical Adviser, Augustine Eguavoen has stepped down from that position with immediate effect,” Sanusi said. “The NFF has in the meantime withdrawn the two-and-half year’s contract offered the coaches and terminated the appointment of the entire technical crew of the team with immediate effect.” Sanusi said a “new crew will be announced after a proper review to lead the new charge of reinvigorating the Super Eagles to face future challenges appropriately. “We thank the coaches and team officials for their service to the nation and wish them success in their future endeavours.”
