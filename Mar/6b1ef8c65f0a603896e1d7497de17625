ACCA will be hosting an online Public Sector Roundtable for the Africa region on 30 March 2022 titled ‘A More Responsive Public Sector: Creating Value for Sustainable Development’. ACCA Director, Africa, Jamil Ampomah, said: ‘Increasingly, investors seek a commitment to sustainability, placing a premium on long-term economic stability rather than the instant gratification of a quick dollar. This is good news for the public sector, and for professional accountants, because we measure success across years and decades rather than financial quarters, and against a whole set of indices – including social value, public well-being, and protecting the environment – rather than the limited focus of a financial report.” Public financial management is among the subjects to be discussed at the high-profile event, alongside other important topics relevant to the public sector. They include finance reforms, capacity building and how the public sector can be more resilient and flexible. ACCA’s Chief Executive, Helen Brand, will be joined by Sajjeed Aslam, ACCA’s global head of the public sector as well as an array of public sector leaders and subject matter experts across the continent.
