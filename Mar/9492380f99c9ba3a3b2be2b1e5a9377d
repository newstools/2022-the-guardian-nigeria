Lagos State Government has pleaded with motorists to show understanding over the planned reopening of Lekki Toll-Gate.
 
The state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotoso, spoke at Arise News Morning Show about the plan by Lekki Concession Company (LCC) to reopen the tolling facility and run it free of charge for two weeks from April 1, 2022. Collection of toll will begin two weeks after.  He said Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had personally commiserated with the family. “Besides, a delegation of top government officials visited the family to console them,” Omotoso said.
  
Omotoso also spoke about the face-off between the National Secretariat and the state chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), saying that the administration is on top of the situation and the suspension of the union’s activities remains in force.
 
He said the government’s ticket recently introduced as part of the transport regulation and reform was to consolidate all collections by the local councils and prevent harassment of transporters by every local authority in the course of doing their legitimate businesses.  On why the state did not compensate the Cane Village residents for the demolition of their property, he said any demolition done for public infrastructure would always be paid for.
