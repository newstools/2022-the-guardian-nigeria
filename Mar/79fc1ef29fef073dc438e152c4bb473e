The organised labour in Kogi State has condemned the media report that Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Onuh Edoka, claimed the state workers were not paid percentage salaries in February this year. A statement by Kogi State NLC Secretary, Paul Omale, noted that the chairman never granted any media interview to that effect, urging the workers to disregard the report. Omale said the organised labour in the state was amazed on how some reputable media houses could be used to publish such an untrue and misleading story, adding that the author of the story was clearly on a mission to set the workers of the state against the leadership of the union. The statement reads in part: “The attention of the leadership of the organised Labour in Kogi State has been drawn to a story published in many national dailies on March 6, 2022 alleging that the NLC chairman, Onuh Edoka, confirmed that no percentage salary was paid to Kogi State workers. “There was no such interview or press statement issued by the NLC chairman, Mr. Onuh Edoka, to any media house.”
