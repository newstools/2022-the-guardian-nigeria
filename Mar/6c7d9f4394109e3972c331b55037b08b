Coogler was arrested while attempting to withdraw $12,000 from his account back in January. Video footage released showed the director, who wore a hoodie, a nose mask and glasses, being accosted by the police on the bank’s premises. The police report revealed that the teller had received an alert on his account because the amount was more than $10,000. Notifying her superior that she thought Coogler was trying to rob the bank, she proceeded to call 911. Coogler had reportedly written a note on the back of his withdrawal slip, the note asked for the money to be counted somewhere else, ending “I’d like to be discreet”. When the police arrived, Coogler’s colleagues waiting for him in a vehicle parked outside the bank were detained and placed in the back of a police car. Coogler was placed in handcuffs while police investigated the call. The police report notes that he was released shortly after his identity was verified. Speaking to Variety about the incident, Coogler said, “This situation should never have happened. However, Bank of America worked with me and addressed it to my satisfaction, and we have moved on.” Speaking to CNN, the Bank of America said, “We deeply regret that this incident occurred. It never should have happened, and we have apologized to Mr. Coogler.” Coogler, at the time of the incident, was working on the production of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, the sequel to his 2018 blockbuster set to be released in November.
