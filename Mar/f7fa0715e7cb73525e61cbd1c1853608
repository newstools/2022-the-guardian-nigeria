These mixtapes are a way of establishing longevity between a Disc Jockey and his fans and the most form that reach a wider audience these days is digital mixtapes, having the musical power in your hands, literally. And it’s also known that these mixtapes run mostly for an average of 1 hour 20 minutes, mostly because a lot of Disc Jockeys burn these mixtapes to Compact Discs and most of the time, always try to limit a mixtape to 80 minutes as this is the maximum length a CD can take. But in this digital era, the demand for CDs is getting lesser due to the fact that everybody wants to have such a mixtape on their phones so they can play anywhere they go and not just limit it to when they can play it from a multimedia player that can read a disc. In fact, most people would rather download a mixtape and play it through Bluetooth and auxiliary ports, which is common everywhere now. As a result, most DJs are already used to the 80 minutes time mark of creating a mixtape, and some go as far as 100 to 120 minutes depending on the platforms they want to upload to. This is how it has been for years, and because of the time limit, a lot of genres and songs are either omitted or rushed to fit into the mixtape. Also, because of the increasing amount of mixtapes that come out everyday, most Disc Jockeys tend to focus majorly on one or two genres per mixtape, and it’s a competition of who has more buzz or who incorporates a lotta effects and samples and transitions into a mixtape, just to create the illusion that it’s not the same playlist that is being shuffled by different DJs in different mixes. Thus, The Fine Wine Mixtape which happens to be a 4 hour mega mixtape hosted by DJ SAMA The Music Demigod, was birthed for two sole reasons: firstly, to create a mixtape that would last longer than an average 1-hour plus mixtape on the digital space, thereby building the enthusiasm of people that would want to experience a party feel right from the comfort of their mobile device, whether they’re just relaxing in their homes, or taking a long drive or even at a random party or event that suits the occasion. Secondly, to cut across the major party genres in an increasing order of tempo to keep the average listener hooked and waiting for the next song or the next transition to come while having a good time along the way. In essence, the mixtape is giving the listener a club feel, from the low tempo ‘trap’ music, all the way to the fast tempo street anthems in the Nigerian space and beyond. It is a must-have for every music enthusiast. The selection of songs and genres blending perfectly to suit any mood at any point in time without any breaks due to short mixtape length or limited genres that makes one feel like they’re listening to the same songs arranged by different DJs without actually experimenting or diversifying, is what makes this mixtape exceptional.
