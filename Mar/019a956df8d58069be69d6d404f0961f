Super Eagles Interim Manager, Augustine Eguavoen, says he is focused on raising a team that will beat Ghana to the Qatar 2022 World Cup ticket. Speaking ahead of Super Eagles’ first training session, yesterday, in Abuja, Eaguavoen said the players have promised to do everything possible to beat Ghana, adding that the first game at the Baba Yaro Stadium, Kumasi, on Friday is very important to their aspirations. Also speaking ahead of the World Cup qualifier, ex international, Henry Nwosu, has urged the Eagles to go for early goals in the first leg of the tie against Ghana. Nwosu, who said the Eagles need to beat Black Stars convincingly away from home to be assured of a berth at the World Cup later this year, advised the team to work on their tactics and mentality to overcome whatever Ghana throws at them in Kumasi. “The Eagles need to be attack minded against Ghana and avoid complacency in every department. They should go for early goals to douse any unexpected pressure from Ghana. “A clear victory in Ghana will already give Eagles the World Cup ticket, but the team must step up their game and realise that any mistake can put Nigeria in a dangerous situation in the home leg,” he said. The Super Eagles are seeking to book seventh World Cup ticket by beating Ghana over two legs in Kumasi and Abuja.
