A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kaduna on Thursday, ordered that a 32-year-old man, Masaoudu Abubakar, should be remanded in a correctional centre for allegedly defiling a five-year-old girl. The police charged Abubakar, a resident of Pambegua Zuntu, Kubau Local Government Area of Kaduna State, with defilement. Chief Magistrate Ibrahim Emmanuel, who did not take the plea of Abubakar, ordered the police to duplicate the case file and send it to the office of the Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. Emmanuel adjourned the case until May 15, for mention. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Insp Chidi Leo, told the court that Abubakar, committed the offence on Jan. 28, at Layin Sarki Fawa Pambegua. The prosecutor said Abubakar lured the girl into an uncompleted building close to his house and forcefully had canal knowledge of her. He said the defendant was caught and handed over to the police by neighbours who heard the girl while crying. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 258 of the Kaduna State Penal Code, 2020 (as amended).
