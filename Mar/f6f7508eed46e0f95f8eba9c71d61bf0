Former President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has described the All Progressives Congress (APC) as an opportunist party that came to power unprepared. The presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stated this, yesterday, in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State, while on a campaign tour to the PDP secretariat. Claiming that APC has no blueprint that can change the country for good, he said all the promises that endeared the ruling party to Nigerians in 2015 were empty. Saraki, who was represented by the former National Chairman PDP, Alhaji Kawu Baraje, asked the people of Kebbi the cost of a bag of rice when PDP was in power and now, even as Kebbi is touted as a big rice producer. “APC is not a political party, but an opportunist group that came to power unprepared and with empty promises to Nigerians,” he said. Pointing out that the people of Kebbi State are PDP but ruled by APC, Saraki described Kebbi as the father of PDP. Meanwhile, while advocating a Saraki presidency, Baraje said: “You see, Bukola is a product of one Nigeria, as his father was an astute nationalist, who believes in one Nigeria and Saraki’s monumental achievements as governor and Senate president speaks for him.” Kebbi PDP Chairman, Usman Suru, assured the Saraki presidential contact committee of his delegates’ support when the time comes.
