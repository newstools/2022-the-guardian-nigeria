The makers have revealed that the latest season(4) has not been released for a while because the length used in production added to the delayed time. Covid-19 was primarily the cause of the delay and in catching up on things since the pandemic, a release date for season 4 has been verified.   Even though creator Ross Duffer warns that season 4  is long, he promises a delightful experience. And the latest season, still a sci-fi series opens up more into its horror aspect. Stranger Things season 4 will be released in two parts with the first part released on 27th May and the second part released on 1st July each having 9 episodes. It will be recalled that in the last scene where Hooper played by David Harbour appeared, ‘he’ was in a prison cell in Russia. While Eleven and the crew are going their separate ways trying to live a normal life.
