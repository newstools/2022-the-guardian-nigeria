These are definitely not the best of times for residents and indigenes of Ekwulobia and Oko communities in Aguata and Orumba North Local Councils of Anambra State, following repeated bloody assaults by gunmen.
     
Within seven days, 12 people have been killed, while some were kidnapped with few lucky ones escaping alive. Oko is home to a Federal Polytechnic, while the Federal College (Technical) is located at Umunze, with a large students’ population, commercial and business activities.
 
A resident said they are now sleeping with one eye open, while many homes, public institutions and commuters are not sure of getting to their destinations.
