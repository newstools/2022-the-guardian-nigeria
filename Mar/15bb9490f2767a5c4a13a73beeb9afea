File sharing app, SHAREit Lite, has assured on its drive to boost productivity and ensure upwardly mobile Nigerians are able to transfer files better and efficiently at their different workplaces and tertiary institutions.
  
According to Regional Marketing Director, SHAREit Lite, Nigeria, Marvin Umebiye, “We’ve seen the upward trend in the use cases for files in the most unbelievable categories, from offices to retail, communal groups, families, informal business owners and a lot more. More than ever, we’re convinced that more needs to be done to fulfil the needs of this insatiable market. We’re constantly gathering our Nigerian users’ experience to meet that more.”  Chike Afamawe, a phone accessories dealer at Computer Village, Ikeja, recalled being able to share his goods without data on SHAREit Lite, adding that it has been pivotal to the success of his business.
   
“The fact that I don’t have to stress myself while sharing pictures of my latest products is so good to be true. When I use WhatsApp subscriptions, I encounter this quality loss, but with SHAREit Lite, the quality is retained and the best part is, it works with or without mobile data. It comes at no extra cost for a subscription. This, for me, is a plus to my business.”
