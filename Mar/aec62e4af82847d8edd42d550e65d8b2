Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Yemi Sanusi, has declared that the party is intact, adding “there is no crisis in its fold.” Sanusi stated this yesterday, while speaking with newsmen shortly after he led the party’s state executive members to a meeting with the state governor, Dapo Abiodun, at his office in Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. He noted that with the inauguration of the state executive members by the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, they were ready to carry out assigned duties in earnest. “Our coming here today is to meet with the governor and discuss how to move the party forward,” he said. Also speaking, the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Tunde Oladunjoye, noted that the executive members, led by the state chairman, as well as senatorial chairmen, were on a courtesy call on the governor to consult and interact on how to ensure a seamless national convention of the party scheduled for March 26, 2022. Oladunjoye corroborated the chairman’s submission that there was no crisis in Ogun APC but waxing stronger on daily basis. He gave the assurance that the exco of the party would operate an inclusive party where no one would be left behind, urging the party faithful and the people of the state to continue to give the government the needed support.
