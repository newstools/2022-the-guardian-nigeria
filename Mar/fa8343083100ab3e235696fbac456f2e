National Identification Number (NIN) diaspora registration has hit 118, 529 as of March 21, 2022, according to data obtained by The Guardian from the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) dashboard. In terms of gender registrations, males lead with 65, 533, while females have 52,996 of them registered. MEANWHILE, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Pantami, has officially opened the 3rd National Identification Number (NIN) diaspora enrolment center in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Pantami, accompanied at the event by the NIMC Director-General/CEO, Aliyu A. Aziz, reiterated the Federal Government’s commitment to ensure that all Nigerians have the foundational identity, most especially Nigerians in the diaspora. He emphasised the need for all Nigerians living and working in the UAE to enrol and be issued the NIN. NIMC, in a statement signed by its Head, Corporate Communications, Kayode Adegoke, and made available to journalists, explained that the newly-opened centre, which is being managed by NIMC-Licensed Diaspora Enrollment partner, Knowledge Square and Plectrum Limited, brings the total number of centres opened in 38 countries to 152. The Dubai center is located on 19th Floor, Conrad Tower, Sheik Zayed, road, and Trade, centre1, Dubai, UAE. Meanwhile, Pantami used the occasion to educate Nigerians in the diaspora on the recently launched FG’s NIN Tokenization policy which was unveiled on September 16th 2021 by President Muhammadu Buhari, as part of his administration’s policy of ensuring the protection of data of all NIN holders, especially for verification to access all government services. It should be recalled that the government had earlier announced March 31, 2022, as the deadline for the adaptation of the Tokenization NIN Verification policy by both the public and private sectors. NIMC said it shall cut overall verification transactions to the NIN Tokenization service with effect from March 31, 2022.
