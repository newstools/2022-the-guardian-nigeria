Members of Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Kwara State University (KWASU), Malete chapter, boycotted the ongoing national strike called by the union due to its financial consequences on the institution. Besides, the local ASUU body has yet to be accorded full membership status of the union. But due to the reported gentleman agreement between KWASU lecturers and the national ASUU body, the institution was not picketed. The Director of KWASU Public Relations, Mr. AbdulRazaq Sanni, disclosed this to The Guardian, yesterday, in Ilorin, Kara State. Normal academic activities were running smoothly at the institution when The Guardian visited its Malete campus. Sanni said: “We are not getting any subvention from any quarter. So, we depend solely on Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) for survival as an institution. “The leadership of ASUU at the national level is aware of this and they are cooperating with us. Nobody is being witch-hunted on this development. If we should join the strike, then we will be grounded. Nevertheless, we are in full solidarity with ASUU. We believe in what they are fighting for. “KWASU is also immune from the strike now because we are standing on the platform of Observer Status at the moment. We are yet to be accorded full membership status of ASUU.”
