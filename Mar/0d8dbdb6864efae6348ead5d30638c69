One of the face’s most important features, it’s no surprise that a lot of people prefer to have their brows done through semi-permanent processes like microblading, brow lamination or eyebrow tinting. Having great brows always doesn’t just make you look good; it also cuts your getting ready time in half. In this piece, we have unlocked everything you need to know about eyebrow tinting in one place and provided answers to any possible questions you might have. What Is Eyebrow Tinting? This beauty process involves temporarily colouring the brow hairs with a stain similar to your skin colour; making sure to fill in thinner spaces within the brow. Tinting your brows add definition and shape to your brows. The human brow is filled with soft, fine vellus hair, which, when tinted, creates fuller, thicker brows adding depth and dimension to your brows. One important detail to note is the first result; the stain only lasts for a week while the colour on the hair strands will grow out between two to four weeks. This semi-permanent makeup trend leaves you with full natural brows, which enhances your face, giving you a youthful appearance. Prepping For Your Appointment When prepping for an eyebrow tint, the first step is to find a professional aesthetician. Once you find one, you’ll need to have them conduct a pre-procedure checkup to rule out allergies. Many eyebrow tints contain para-phenylenediamine (PPD), which might irritate the thin skin around the eyes. As such, your aesthetician should conduct a patch test before applying the dye to remove the risk of infection. You’d also need to communicate your desired result and colour to your provider before your appointment. One tip to choosing the right colour for your eyebrow tint is to opt for one that mimics the deepest shade found in the hair on your head for a more natural look. For definition, choose a colour that is one to two shades deeper than the base tone of your hair. Finally, be prepared for the difference. Your face might appear different once the process is completed, but you’ll surely have gorgeous brows at the end. How The Process Works Eyebrow tinting typically takes around 15 minutes. Your aesthetician will start off by cleaning and prepping your brow area. Next, they’ll mix a dye in a custom shade for you to create the most natural look and apply the dye. Once applied, it’ll be left on for several minutes, depending on the results you desire. Darker brows take much longer, while light brows need be left on for only a short period. Aftercare To ensure the best results, make sure to keep your brows for the first 12-24 hours after tinting. Avoid rubbing and scrubbing your brows to ensure the tint lasts longer. Remember always to groom your brows using a brow gel, especially if you have thick, coarse brows. Brush the gel upwards for a fuller look. Asides the risk of allergic reactions, eyebrow tints are generally a safe procedure to groom your brows. So if you’re allergy-free and looking for a long term solution to caring for your brows, this is the procedure for you.
