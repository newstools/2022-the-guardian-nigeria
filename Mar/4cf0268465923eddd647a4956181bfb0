The newly-elected Lagos State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Phillip Olabode Aivoji, has urged members of the party to work assiduously to dislodge the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. In a statement yesterday, Aivoji said the party’s members should put an end to infighting, division, personal interests and unnecessary political bickering, if the PDP would be trusted with their votes by the people to govern Lagos. He said it would not be an easy task to dislodge the ruling APC through the ballot box, but through co-operation and selling of the party to the electorate. Aivoji, who appealed to all members of the party to eschew bitterness and rancour, said: “I wish to express my deep appreciation to all members of our party. It is imperative for me to acknowledge with gratitude all our leaders and teeming members of the party who have contributed immensely to my emergence as the state chairman and the success of the congress generally.”
