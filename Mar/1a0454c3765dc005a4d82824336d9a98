Onwuasoanya, a former Programme Officer at the National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Imo State, described the new law, as a bait to distract Nigerians from their frustration with the existing electoral system. His words: “The new Electoral Act is nothing but a bait meant to give Nigerians a false hope that something will change in the electoral system, while my Party (APC) or the PDP, continue to explore new tricks to manipulate upcoming elections. “Why do you think that the mere fact that an electoral bill has been signed into law will guarantee improvement in our elections, while, there have been laws since the amalgamation of Nigeria criminalising corruption, yet corruption remains rife in the country? He asked. MEANWHILE, Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has congratulated the new Catholic Archbishop of Owerri Ecclesiastic Province, Dr. Lucius Ugorji, who replaced the immediate past Archbishop, Anthony J. V. Obinna.
