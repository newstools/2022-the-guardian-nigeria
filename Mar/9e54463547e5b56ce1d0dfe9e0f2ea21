Sulfates are chemicals typically found in the surfactants responsible for that soothing lather that appears when you work some shampoo into your scalp. However, experts reveal that sulfates only have an apparent value. This means that they may appear to help you get rid of oil, grease, and hair products, but in the true sense, they’re stripping your hair of the natural oils it needs. The result is dry, brittle hair that cannot be covered up by merely conditioning. Sulfate-free shampoos are the in thing because no one wants hair that gets progressively more brittle with every wash. Here are a few ways sulfate-free shampoos improve hair health. They maintain healthy hair oils Many sulfate-containing shampoos are quickly searching for non-sulfate based alternatives that also lather and their sulfate counterparts. This has led to the discovery of healthier formulations that retain moisture and shine. Examples include coconut-based surfactants that remove dirt and grime effectively but do not strip your strands of the natural oils that prevent breakage and brittleness and keep your hair soft and supple. Improve texture and bounce Using sulfate-containing shampoos with curly hair is a set-up. Firstly, they make your hair difficult to untangle, and you may not notice this after one wash, but over time they cause your curls to droop and lose their elasticity. Sulfate-free shampoos will maintain the lively character of your bounce and keep your curls moisturised and polished. They delay ageing Yes, your sulfate-containing shampoo may make you turn grey prematurely. Sulfates strip hair of not just oils but also pigments. This is quite noticeable when you dye your hair. The dye may appear duller when you wash your hair with a sulfate-containing shampoo. The same applies to your natural hair colour. If you do not have any dye products in your hair, the sulfates in the shampoo will take some colour out of your strands themselves. Thus, jet black hair may lose its vigour, and brown hair may start to sprout a few greys. Prevent skin irritations Certain skin types are prone to skin irritations with sulfate use. These irritations may be triggered when shampoo contacts skin or be found on the scalp. Sulfate-free options are safer and more protective.
