Warns Against Using Students For Protest
The Department of State Security (DSS) yesterday issued a security alert over plot by some elements to instigate ethno-religious violence in the country. The agency also raised the alarm over plot by subversive elements to use students who are at home due to strike for protest. It said the aim was to cause ethno-religious crisis, ignite reprisals and heat up the polity. Spokesperson of the secret agency, Peter Afunanya, in a statement, said the sponsors have mobilised foot soldiers and held several meetings in and outside the target areas to achieve their aims. “The Service is also aware of a plot to use students, striking University teachers, labour unions, disgruntled individuals and strategic groups as well as exploit the global energy situation to carry out a mass protest like the #ENDSARS. This is despite ongoing efforts by government to address the issues. “While the Service views the machination as unpatriotic, it is on the trail of the agents of destabilisation who are desirous of using violence to achieve ulterior goals.” Though it has emplaced measures to disrupt these tendencies, it warns the ring leaders and their cohorts to desist from acts capable of causing a breakdown of law and order. “The public should be rest assured that the Service will, in conjunction with other security agencies, go after the sponsors of this scheme and ensure the law takes it course,” the statement read. Afunanya advised citizens not only to engage according to rules but should resist persuasions to be used to destroy their own country. He warned that those who may wish to go contrary to the law would face the consequences.
