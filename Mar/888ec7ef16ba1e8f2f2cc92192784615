The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has stated its objection to the introduction of e-valuator and e-invoicing for import and export businesses by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).
   
CBN had, in a letter dated July 8, 2021, informed NCS that they were deploying a mechanism for verification of prices of goods before allocation of forex at the point of e-form M registration.  “This agreement also prescribes five other methods for arriving at Customs value where the transaction value is unacceptable. They are the transaction value of identical goods, the transaction value of similar goods, the Deductive value method, the Computed value method, and the Fallback method applied sequentially.”
   
Bomodi stated that the House of Representatives, Joint Committee on Customs and Excise, Banking and Currencies had directed that all agencies with defined roles in the supply chain meet to harmonise procedures with particular reference to resolving the issue of value for trade purposes.
