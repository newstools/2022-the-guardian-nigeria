Ghana will begin their full preparation for their Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier against Nigeria today with a training session at the Ohene Djan Stadium, Accra. According to Ghana Football Association, all the players invited for the two-legged tie are expected to be in Accra latest today for the two sessions. The team will move to Kumasi, the venue of the match, tomorrow and continue their preparations for the game on a training pitch outside Baba Yara Stadium. On Thursday, the team will have its first official training at the Baba Yara Stadium after which Coach Otto Addo will address the press at the Kumasi Sports Stadium Media Centre. The Black Stars will host Nigeria at the Babayara Stadium on March 25, 2022, before jetting off to Abuja for the second leg at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium on March 29, 2022. The last time Ghana hosted Nigeria at the Babayara Stadium in Kumasi was in 1990 with Saara Mensah’s goal of giving the Black Stars the victory in the end. According to GFA, the players invited for the clash have received their air tickets and were expected to arrive in the country from last Saturday night. Despite the Ghana FA’s strategy not to release the squad in time for the game, sources say the squad will be dominated by players, who are featured in the 2021 AFCON and some debutants. Already, newly appointed technical adviser, Chris Hughton, has arrived in Accra for the games. He is being assisted by Borussia Dortmund’s assistant coach, Otto Addo, George Boateng of Aston Villa and Mas-Ud Didi Dramani. Apart from Houghton, who has also arrived in Ghana, Addo and Boateng were expected to arrive yesterday, while Didi will arrive from his base in Denmark today. The Guardian gathered that some of the players the Black Stars are banking on to upset Super Eagles are Chelsea’s Callum Hudson Odoi, Tariq Lamptey of Brighton and Salisu Mohammed of Southampton.
