SIR: The Lagos State government should please consider setting up Lost Items Recovery Centres in all the Local Government Areas (LGAs) and the Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs). This is something that is overdue and it is meant to afford whoever has lost valuable items the opportunity of recovering them. The choice of the local councils is because most lost items are found in different locations of some local councils and that will allow whoever loses any item to know where to go for them.
 
There are many times valuable items are found by kind-hearted people, who wished there was a place where they could drop such items for the owners to come for them. But since such a place does not exist, the items are left and abandoned by the roadside or they are grabbed by other people, who are not the real owner. If this suggestion is accepted, the implementation will include liaising with a radio station where announcements will be made from time to time to notify the public about whatever items are waiting for collection by the rightful owners, who should come forward with evidence of ownership.
