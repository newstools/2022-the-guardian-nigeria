• We will prosecute defaulters, says Commissioner
Despite last week’s proscription of National Union of Road Transport Workers Union (NURTW) and their activities in all Lagos parks and garages, members of the union, yesterday, continued their usual collection of levies from commercial drivers in parks and major roads across the state.
 
The Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, on Thursday, March 10, 2022, said government decided to suspend the activities of NURTW after considering the provisions of the law.
   
Omotoso added that the suspension of the activities of the union was necessitated to douse the unnecessary tension generated by the leadership tussle in the NURTW and protect the citizenry from the likely fallout of the situation.
