In the year 2021, the Nigerian economy recorded the highest growth of its GDP since 2014, beating the expectations of economists and the projections of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The economy grew by 3.4 per cent in full-year 2021 compared to a contraction of 1.94 per cent in full-year 2020, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).  The Federal Ministry of Finance had estimated a growth of 2.5 per cent while the projection of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was 3.1 per cent. After two recessions induced by the pandemic, Africa’s biggest economy came out of its worst recession in 33 years growing by 0.11 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Nigeria’s oil production declined to 1.50 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter of 2021 from 1.57 million barrels a day in the third quarter. Nigeria has not benefited from rising oil prices as it is battling to increase its oil production.

The laggards were oil refining -47.9 per cent, crude petroleum and natural gas -8.3 per cent and mining and quarrying-7.7 per cent.
