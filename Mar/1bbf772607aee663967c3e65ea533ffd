Gov. Bello Matawalle of Zamfara, on Monday, expressed sadness over the recent bandits’ attack on communities in Bukkuyum and Maru Local Government areas of the state. Matawalle stated this in a condolence message issued by his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications, Malam Zailani Bappa. He expressed the regret that the ‘dastardly and cowardly attack’ was coming at a time when peace was fast improving in the state. The governor, however, assured that the recent attack would not deter his administration’s efforts at achieving total peace in the state. “It is unfortunate that this attack is coming at a time when we are experiencing improved peace in the state, where we were able to host millions of people in an important religious event without a single incidence. “However, this and other isolated cases of banditry across the state will not deter our efforts at ensuring a peaceful Zamfara, an oath we have taken to pursue with our fullest capability,” Matawalle said. He consoled with the families of those whose lives were lost in the attack. The governor directed the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to immediately release relief materials to all victims of the attack and their families.
