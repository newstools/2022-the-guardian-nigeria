One of the foremost Greek philosophers, Plato, said that there may be times we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest. The above quote by the great Plato captures the plight of Isi-Uzo people of Enugu State, who obviously have been marginalised in the scheme of things since the inception of the current political dispensation but have remained calm in the face of such outright injustice. I am of the imperative opinion that the time for self-appraisal tailored towards achieving political liberation and justice has come.  I am of the candid opinion that elders of Enugu State should preserve the current charter of equity embedded in the zoning of political offices for a peaceful transition of power in the state and address the plight of Isi-Uzo people now. Let the objective views of a respected statesman of Nkanu extraction, Chief Anike Nwoga, that there is no superior or inferior local government in Enugu East Zone be acknowledged in deciding the fate of Isi-Uzo in 2023 political calculation. Equity, justice and fair play usually adopted by the amiable governor of Enugu State, Rt Hon Dr. Ifeanyi Lawrence Ugwuanyi when taking political decisions is the bedrock of successful democracies across developing societies of the globe. A stitch in time saves nine.
