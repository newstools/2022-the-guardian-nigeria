International Women’s Day (IWD) is a global day celebrating the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. The day also marks a call to action from both men and women for accelerating gender parity. In APM Terminals Nigeria we want to forge women’s equality. Collectively we can all #BreakTheBias. We must step up and be aware of the significant impact that bias has on women’s equality – both conscious and unconscious bias. We need to recognize it and call it out! Women in the APM Terminals leadership team in Nigeria are reflecting on the importance of breaking the bias and their leadership experience. Uzoma Ben-Ude, HR Business Partner, APM Terminals Nigeria
