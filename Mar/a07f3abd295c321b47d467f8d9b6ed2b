Since Kim Kardashian filed for divorce a year ago, February 2021, drama has continued to trail the split. What looked like a co-parenting agreement when it was first announced took another turn after Ye went public with his reconciliation attempts. As he has made clear, he does not intend to have her date Pete Davidson whom he refers to as “you know who” and become legally single. Recall that last month, Kardashian said, “I very much want to be divorced. Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.” Now, their prenup is the new subject of this limitation. Perhaps, as an attempt to prevent her from moving on, his lawyer, Samantha Spector, has argued that prenups taken in California after 2002 is invalid.
A little twist here is that for a prenup to be declared invalid, one of the parties who signed it will have to challenge its validity but Kanye had a lawyer with him when he signed it. What this means is that Kanye will have to prove it was “unconscionable.” Kardashian had only last week asked the court to speed up her divorce, saying it would help husband Ye to accept the relationship is over.
