Super Eagles Manager, Augustine Eguavoen, claims that Nigeria deserves to be at the Qatar 2022 World Cup ahead of Ghana. Eguavoen is currently getting ready for the big clash between Nigeria and Ghana, which decides, who, among the two, will be in Qatar later this year. The two sides will meet in Cape Coast, Ghana, on March 25 and play the decisive leg in Abuja, Nigeria, on March 29. The winner over two legs will pick the ticket to be among Africa’s five countries at the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Speaking to a Ghanasportspagea, Eguavoen, who led Nigeria to a last 16 finish at last month’s Africa Cup of Nations, said the Super Eagles are in a better position to qualify for the World Cup than their rivals. “There is no doubt in my mind. I am a Nigerian, a full-blooded Nigerian, and if you asked me such a question, I think, without missing words, we deserve a place at the World Cup,” he said. Eguavoen, however, acknowledged that the games would not be easy for either side. “It’s going to be a very tough game and a tight one as well. “We have a lot of mutual respect for one another, and when Ghana plays Nigeria and Nigeria plays Ghana, it’s always tough, it’s always tight. But you see, it’s going to boil down to us trying to go there (Ghana). “We will play everything we can to try to win the game, in fact, both games, but with no disrespect because Ghana is a very strong side, individually and collectively. We will just go and fight and try to win the game,” he said. Nigeria is expected to begin camping for the matches in Abuja on March 21 and leave for Ghana on the eve of the Cape Coast leg of the tie.
