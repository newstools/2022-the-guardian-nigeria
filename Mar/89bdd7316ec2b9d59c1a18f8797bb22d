After two years of restriction, Saudi Arabia has confirmed the participation of foreign pilgrims from around the world in this year’s hajj rituals. Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah Sunday disclosed that a revised quota of pilgrims for hajj 2022 will soon be released to each participating country. Saudi Authorities in 2020 restricted the annual spiritual activities to citizens and residents within the Kingdom as part of stringent measures to prevent the spread of the deadly Covid-19. The lifting of restrictions for international pilgrims for the 2022 hajj came less than 24 hours after the Kingdom opened its gateways to direct flights from 17 countries including Nigeria. By this direction, Nigeria pilgrims and millions around the world are guaranteed the assurance to participate in this year’s religious obligation that will hold between June and July 2022.
