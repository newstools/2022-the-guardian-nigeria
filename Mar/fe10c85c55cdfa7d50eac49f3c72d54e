Former international, Felix Owolabi, has advised Super Eagles handlers to work on improving the team’s tactical discipline before Nigeria’s final Qatar World Cup qualifier against Ghana. Nigeria is slated to meet Ghana in a crucial World Cup playoff on March 25 and 29 in Cape Coast and Abuja respectively. According to Owolabi, the Eguavoen-led coaching crew only needs to build up his players’ confidence and ensure they adhere to team play at all times in the games to qualify for the World Cup holding later this year. “Those in charge of the team should concentrate on the core players, who took part at the AFCON in Cameroun. I think these players are good and should not be left out of the team. “He should build confidence in the players by drawing up a moderate tactical approach to triumph at the end of the two games. “More importantly, we should work on our wing play and get a very strong and intelligent defensive midfielder. We need reliable attacking midfielders and attackers, who at all times can convert chances to goals.” He also advised the coaches to look for a captain that has the ability to communicate effectively with his mates during every game. He also advised Eguavoen to adopt an attacking formation, adding that going to Ghana with the intent to defend and earn a draw could work against Nigeria. “I know the Ghanaians would want to do everything possible to win the first leg on their home soil, but the Eagles should not lose their heads, as all that is required of them is 100 per cent concentration. “I pray that our players are injury free for the matches, while I also wish them best of luck,” he stated.
