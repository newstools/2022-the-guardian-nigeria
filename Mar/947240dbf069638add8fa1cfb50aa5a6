Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has broken the ground for the commencement of the construction of Oak Heights in Eko Atlantic City. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of The Oak Holdings, Olukayode Olusanya, said the Oak Heights is designed to be the tallest residential building dotting the skylines of Eko Atlantic City. He said the development “echoes architectural magnificence in luxury buildings and finesse in real estate engineering. Olusanya added that, “The apartments boast of the opulence of fine spacious living where residents can enjoy about 50,000 square metres of expansive building area, 75-foot long pool, spa rooms with an ambience of ease, top of the line fitness centres, tranquil and lavishly appointed conference rooms, maisonettes and villas with suspended pools, apartments with generous living spaces and ultra-luxury finishes.” He said the Oak Heights brings to life a new type of structure that perfectly embodies the 21st Century age of technical ingenuity and extreme inequality, adding that the building represents a heady confluence of engineering prowess, architectural phenomenon and an unparalleled concentration of personal wealth. Commenting, Governor Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Lagos State Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, encouraged private operators in the built environment to collaborate with the state government in bridging the housing deficit. He said the Lagos State Government is building housing schemes as part of an effort to increase the housing stock in the state in fulfillment of its promise to provide decent houses to the citizenry on a continuous basis. The governor said the state government is encouraging the private sector and also supporting individuals with a robust mortgage system. According to him, in some of the housing schemes, the state government is encouraging the citizens to pay five percent of the cost of the building and move in, while the balance is defrayed over time.
