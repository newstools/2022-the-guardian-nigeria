Books that change history do not come as heavy tomes. Back in 1848, the world was shaken up with the publication of The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. The battle cry across the globe became: “Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains!” The underlying statement ran thusly: “The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles.” Revolution became the rage all over the world. Now, in this year of Our Lord, coming out of Nigeria is the landmark book: The Centrist Manifesto by Uchenna Nwankwo.
 
It is crucial to reiterate the two quotes that launch forth Uchenna Nwankwo’s The Centrist Manifesto. First is an Albert Einstein quote, to wit: “If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” Then follows Miguel de Unamuno’s quote: “Only he who attempts the absurd is capable of achieving the impossible.”
 
The society at large almost always puts the stamp of absurdity on the forehead of every original thinker. In Nigeria where most people would rather eat and consume than think originally, the thinker Uchenna Nwankwo amply represents an endangered species. The saving grace though is that even as the original thinker is scoffed at first he, as history attests, ends up victorious at the very last. For example, Galileo Galilei was made to recant his observation that the earth moved round the sun by the Catholic Church but the Church had to apologise to the scientist in the end.
