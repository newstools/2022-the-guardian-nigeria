Crystal Palace forward, Jordan Ayew and Roma of Italy’s youngster, Felix Afena Gyan, have been chosen to lead Ghana’s attack in the Qatar 2022 World Cup qualifier against Nigeria on Friday. Ghana’s hopes rest on the combination of the duo following the absence of team captain, Andre Ayew, who is ineligible for the matches owing to the red card he got in the recently concluded Africa Cup of Nations finals held in Cameroun. Nigeria and Ghana are battling for one of five tickets to represent Africa in Qatar in a two-legged encounter Ghana interim coach, Otto Addo, only named his 27-man squad for the matches yesterday, a move some see as a psychological stunt, which may have no bearing on the tie. There is the belief among Ghana’s football analysts that Joseph Wollacott will be in goal instead of returning former number one Richard Ofori, who missed the Africa Cup of Nations due to injury. Daniel Amartey and Gideon Mensah will man the central defence, while stand-in captain, Thomas Partey, will lead the midfield flanked by Iddrisu Baba of RCD Mallorca and Ajax Amsterdam’s Mohammed Kudus.

Joseph Wollacott (Swindon Town -England), Abdul Manaf Nurudeen (KAS Eupen -Belgium), Lawrence Ati Zigi (St Gallen -Switzerland) and Richard Ofori (Orlando Pirates -South Africa).
