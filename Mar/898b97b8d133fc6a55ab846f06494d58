The convener, Treasures Uchegbu, disclosed that SpeakingFingers sign language is a social interaction outreach to the deaf community and a self help project aimed at bridging existing communication gap between the hearing and deaf community. She explained that the activity was to strengthen sign language skills, disability awareness, exposure and learning experience of 100-level students of LASCOHET. The students were divided into five groups for proper interaction. Some of the activities they taught the lpakodo deaf students were personal and menstrual hygiene, hand washing, COVID-19 protection, drawing and painting, singing and dancing among others. She noted that some of the students have not seen or engaged with persons with hearing impairment, and were excited to practise what they were taught in class in real-life situations. Uchegbu lauded the UN for supporting the course of people living with disability. Head of the unit, Ipakodo Junior Grammar School Special, Mrs Okocha Idayat Olaoti, urged parents and caregivers to learn sign language to help communicate with deaf persons in society. Another Teacher, Mrs. Adedokun Oluyemisi Omoboade, advised people to be loving, patient and learn sign language. The Principal, lpakodo Junior Grammar school, Mrs. Eleso Mabel Oluwatoyin, appreciated the gesture of SpeakingFingers, LASCOHET and the state government for approving the laudable initiative.
