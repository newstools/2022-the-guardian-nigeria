Engineers under the aegis of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering (NAE) have called for massive investment in Internet of Things (IoTs) technology infrastructure in the country to boost socio-economic development.
  
With expected $55.7 billion investment by 2025 and $11 trillion worth of investment for IoTs by 2030, they noted that IoTs allow firms to automate processes, save money on labour, reduce waste and improve service delivery, hence the need for developing economies like Nigeria to commit more funding support for the sector.  He said IoT has become useful in varied aspects of life, in particular to limit agriculture food wastages as the report indicates that one third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tonnes yearly.
  
Other use cases of IoT, he said are connected health devices, smart homes and cities, transport and public safety, energy monitoring, telemedicine, industrial and enterprise, contactless payment, oil pipelines and smart lighting.
   
He said the sector offers new career opportunities such as software engineers, cloud computing engineers, data scientists, data analytics and visualisation, adding that the sensor industry will also grow exponentially.  To him, as IoT connections increase, there will be a continuous rise in data collected; expected exponential data growth will be in industrial, climate, security and safety use cases.
   
“5G will further accelerate the adoption of IoT, speed, latency, increased bandwidth. IoT is all about availability of wide range of sensor from visual, vibration, temperature, weight to acoustic while anything operational can be measured by sensors, no sensors, no IoT,” he said
