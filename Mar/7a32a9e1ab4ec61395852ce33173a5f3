Newly elected Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Basil Ejidike, has expressed the hope that his faction’s leadership will hold the ace at the party’s. Ejidike, who spoke to The Guardian on telephone, yesterday, explained that the Court of Appeal in Awka had granted the stay of execution at an Awka High Court and appeal his purported removal at the Court of Appeal, insisting that the matter was awaiting final decision. He argued that the publication of the names of delegates to APC’s national convention in March from the faction of the party under his leadership was an indication that there was no crisis in state chapter of the party. Ejidike revealed that under the Senator Andy Uba leadership, the party could boast of new members including the Deputy Governor of Anambra State, Dr. Nkem Okeke, Senator Stella Oduah, four members of the House of Representatives and six members of the state House of Assembly, who were listed as delegates in the forthcoming convention. He however, lamented that former Speaker, Rita Maduagwu and Ikem Uzoezie were excluded fro the list of delegates. “When Dr. Chris Ngige was leader of ÀPC in the state, he never produced even councilor in his ward, to the extent that none of the present councilors, state and National Assembly members emerged from his primary constituencies. “There has not been any change. I still maintain that what appears to be a problem in Anambra APC is not, because some former leaders have ended up playing into the hands of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), which is using them to create distractions. “I advice APC members to remain calm and focused, because the party is still intact under my leadership. Nothing has changed.”
