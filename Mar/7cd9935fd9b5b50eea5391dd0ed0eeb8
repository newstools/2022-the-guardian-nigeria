Netcore Cloud, an interactive marketing solution provider and Axon analytics, a creative digital agency in Nigeria have established a joint venture, to offer top-quality digital marketing services to customers in the country in the last five years.
  
The market’s need for seamless omnichannel marketing and digital marketing solutions was the reason why both companies collaborated in order to grow the marketing communications industry in Nigeria.
  
According to the company’s Regional Vice President, Africa, Nisham Chhabra, Netcore cloud is a global martech product company that helps B2C brands create exceptionally seamless digital experiences for customers that help in acquisition, engagement and retention. Backed by marketing automation and personalization, it has enabled four of the largest banks in Nigeria to develop a digital-first approach for their customers across email, mobile apps and social media.  “Armed with a full-stack growth platform for marketing, product management, growth management, and customer engagement, Netcore Cloud identifies large pools of customer data and transforms it into valuable insights in real-time to fuel every aspect of a business’s digital growth. Often marketers have to play guesswork while making decisions and hope for the best.
  
“Netcore Cloud’s AI-powered engine Raman takes this risk off the plate. Backed by the power of AI, Raman identifies the persona of your customers and defines a unique strategy to establish an effective connection with each customer. This level of hyper-personalization has helped to improve the marketing ROI for thousands of marketers efficiently.”
  
In his own explanation, Netcore’s Client Success Manager, Chukwudi Nwokike, explained further that for over two decades, Netcore Cloud has been the trusted partner and a leading player in creating smooth digital experiences and solutions for banking and financial institutions around the globe.
