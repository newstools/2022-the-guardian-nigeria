God created Man and animals but said it is not good that a man should be alone, therefore, He created Woman. I mean, even God acknowledges how special women are. It is said that “What a man can do, a woman can do better.” Beat that! At school, a lot of ladies excel in their studies and graduate as the best. At the office, a lot of women are the heads of their departments. Everywhere you go, you would see a woman. We have women that do “men’s jobs” and excel at it: mechanics, painters, carpenters, cobblers and even conductors. At home, a wife and mother is referred to as the home makers and quite a number of men wonder what they would do without their girlfriends, wives or mothers. International Women’s day which is celebrated on March 8 and was founded by Clara Zetkin in 1910, is a day set aside to celebrate the successes and strides that women have achieved in different areas of life. In 1908, International Women’s Day grew out of the Labour movement, which saw 15,000 women, marching the streets of New York, demanding better pay, shorter working hours as well as the right to vote. It was first celebrated in 1911 in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland and today, it is celebrated worldwide. This day which celebrates the extent at which women have come in society, economics, and politics, was made official in 1974, when the United Nations started celebrating the annual event. The first theme which was “Celebrating the past, planning for the future”, was adopted in 1996. The theme for this year is #BreakTheBias: A world free of bias, stereotypes and discrimination.
