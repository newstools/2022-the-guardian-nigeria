Stakeholders comprising heads of Department of French in Nigerian universities and colleges of education, and the management of the Nigeria French Language Village (NFLV) have expressed dismay at the delisting of the NFLV from TETFund since 2010. They, therefore, called on the Federal Government re-integrate the institution into the scheme.
 
Rising from a meeting at the French Village in Badagry, Lagos, they called on the government to revisit the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the French Government and the language village with a view to reviving the educational and cultural cooperation between the parties.  While frowning at the habit of ferrying students across the border for self-interest, and in defiance of repeated ministerial orders, the management of the NFLV also reasserted its commitment to regularly receiving lecturers of French in the Nigerian colleges of education for sabbatical leave in NFLV as well as students on special programmes as requested by concerned colleges of education.
 
The stakeholders also recommended that more funds be allocated to the NFLV to create a better and conducive environment for the teaching and learning of French.
