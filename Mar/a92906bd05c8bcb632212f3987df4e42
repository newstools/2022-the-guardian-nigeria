The Kwara Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (KWACCIMA) says the rising cost of gasoline , popularly known as diesel, is killing businesses in the state. Mr Olalekan Ayodimeji, the KWACCIMA President, made this known in a statement on Thursday in Ilorin. Ayodimeji described the development as worrisome. According to him, industries in the state are wailing and businesses groaning in silence, while consumers are confronted with the dilemma of hyperinflation and low purchasing power. The chamber also noted that a situation where diesel was dispensed at N750 per litre in the face of the nation’s irregular power supply and collapse of the national grid called for concern. According to him, this is like rubbing pepper to an injury as business owners and entrepreneurs struggle to survive what they call harsh business environment. The KWACCIMMA president, who also attributed the rising cost of diesel and kerosene on the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, appealed to government to cushion the adverse effects of the development. He said that government should urgently hold a critical session with business leaders to discuss on ways to reduce the challenges arising from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The chamber called on business leaders and entrepreneurs in large, medium, small and nano enterprises to be resilient and remain dogged in view of the current challenges in the business space. It also pleaded with the end-users and consumers to show understanding and bear with producers and sellers of goods and commodities on price consequences that might arise from the present situation.
