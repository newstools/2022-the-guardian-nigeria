Allays fears of being given APC treatment The Lead Visioner, Lagos4Lagos Movement, Dr. Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran, popularly known as Jandor, has integrated the movement and its members into the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) structure in a statewide tour. The first phase of the integration took place in Ojo, Badagry, Amuwo-Odofin and Ajeromi-Ifelodun local councils. In his remarks, at the weekend, Jandor stressed the need for the PDP to stay united ahead of the 2023 general election, saying it is time to deliver Lagos State from oppression. He said that only a united PDP could win Lagos, adding that the All Progressives Congress (APC) biggest fear is a united PDP on all fronts. Also, while reacting to insinuations by some APC members that the PDP would serve him the APC treatment, Jandor noted that the PDP is a democratic party owned by members unlike the APC owned by a single individual. He dismissed the thinking in the APC camp that Philip Aivoji from the Badagry Division was elected at the congress to block his chances of picking the PDP’s ticket. He said the Lagos4Lagos executives had been mandated to attend the party’s meeting at wards and local councils as floor members. Also commenting on the recently-signed Electoral Act Amendment Bill by the President, the Lagos4Lagos convener disclosed that the electronic transmission provision in the Act would forestall the malfeasance usually perpetrated by the APC at the collation centres. Ojo Local Council Chairman, James Agbaje, said he was excited with the smooth working relationship between the PDP and Lagos4Lagos Movement in the council, adding that all the 11 ward chairmen of the party are present to welcome Jandor’s group. Highlight of the occasion was the presentation of PDP’s flags to the Lagos4Lagos ward chairmen by the existing PDP ward & local council chairmen in the council.
