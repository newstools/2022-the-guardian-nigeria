The Society of Women Accountants of Nigeria (SWAN), yesterday, called for support for orphanages and less privileged members of the society.
 
The female accountants made the call when they donated a water treatment plant, 4000-litre water tank, clothes and food items to the Red Cross Motherless and Abandoned Babies Home, Makoko, Yaba, Lagos. The group said the donation is of utmost importance after it witnessed the struggle by the home to get potable water.
   
The Chairperson, Committee of SWAN’s visit to homes for less privileged, Yewande Ode, said: “They do not have potable water. They told us that they used to put alum in water to make it cleaner before drinking, and that is not good enough. The other day, I saw a water seller bringing in water in a wheelbarrow. When we approached them, they told us that they wanted a water treatment plant.
 
“We are doing this to touch lives; we feel that everything is not about our profession, God has given to us and we need to give back to the society. These are children who do not have the love of a mother, so we decided to touch their lives, making life better for them and acknowledging the people taking care of them. “This is a project everyone should get involved in. This home needs a secondary school instead of the children travelling a far distance to access secondary education. And I think some rich people should look towards that. People need to give back to society.”
 
Chairman of the home, Chief Omolara Ehindero, said the home lacked potable water for so long and the donation will go a long way in solving the problem. 
 
“We have so many donors but this is the best donation so far, water is life. At times, we put alum in the water and at other times we boil to make it potable. And just like Oliver Twist, we ask for more as the children will be praying for the donors.”
