The Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Mr Joseph Ari, says he is not vying for any elective position. Ari said this on Saturday when he briefed the press on Saturday in Jos. He also that he had never contemplated of vying for any elective position now or in the nearest future. According to him, he is presently busy and fully engaged with the onerous responsibility of deploying the mandate of the ITF to equip Nigerians with skills for employability and entrepreneurship. He observed that some people were bent on pulling him down by printing campaign posters suggesting that he “is aspiring for an elective position and also canvassing support for the aspirations of some candidates that are vying for elective positions in the All Progressives Congress (APC). “I have been reliably informed that these people plot to flood the convention venue with these posters to breed mistrust and disharmony and thereby generate rancour for their own selfish purposes”. He called on the public to disregard any campaign poster to the effect that he “is running for any elective position, or in support of the ambition of any candidate during the upcoming APC convention as it is false, unfounded and not deserving of any attention”. He also said that he had reported the matter to the security agencies for their further necessary action.
