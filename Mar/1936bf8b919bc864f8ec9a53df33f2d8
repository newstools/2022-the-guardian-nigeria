The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Access Holdings Plc, Dr. Herbert Wigwe, has said that the bank, in its move to become one of the top five in Africa by 2027, plans to deepen its trade finance capacity to support intra-African trade, enhance payments and diaspora remittances. According to Wigwe, the bank had never failed to meet its aspirations in terms of growth in its 20-year history, adding that the bank’s projection for 2027 would be pursued aggressively and be met. Wigwe told journalists that the projection would see the bank regionalising its presence on the continent with regional offices in Ghana, Nairobi, Botswana, South Africa and Nigeria. He said that the company, after 20 years, was moving to another level, creating a much more diversified institution. Wigwe said that Access Bank has moved to a Holding Company, with the bank as one of its subsidiaries in line with the changing times in which it aims to be Africa’s inspiration to the world. “Banking is changing at a faster pace than we can imagine,” Wigwe, who has transitioned to Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Access Holdings Plc, said. According to him, technology is changing all things. He said that anyone that failed to change with the trends would suddenly wake up one day to find out he had no business anymore. Wigwe said the bank was creating strong digital technology in line with its growth to ensure efficient service delivery. He said  the bank would continue to support the government in making the economy better, just as it played a major role in the formation of CACOVID to intervene at the height of the pandemic. Access Holdings Plc had on Monday announced board changes at its banking subsidiary, Access Bank Plc.
