The fight for gender equality has been waged for well over a century. And while there may well have been strides made in that time, with greater representation of women at all levels in business and government and signs of progress towards wage equality in certain corporates and sectors, there are still significant barriers that prevent true equality from becoming a reality.
 
Research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) underlines this, with the Global Gender Gap Report 2021 showing that another entire generation of women will have to wait for gender parity. The report calculated that closing the global gender gap has increased from 99.5 years to 135.6 years. In Saharan Africa, where gender parity sits at 67.2 per cent, that gap can be closed slightly quicker: in 121.7 years.
 
The ability to close this gap has been hampered by the impact of the pandemic. Evidence outlined in the report suggests that the health emergency and the ensuing economic downturn have impacted women more severely than men, amplifying existing gender gaps and partially re-opening gaps that had already been closed.  Inclusivity and equality are part of the fabric that has made up the DNA of the business for many years: the company signed the UN Women’s Empowerment Principles in 2013 to express support for advancing equality between women and men. And in line with showing this support, Mondelēz committed to spending $1 billion with minority and women-owned businesses by 2024.
 
These efforts are ongoing and widespread – but true gender equality can only be possible if ever-more companies and people commit to being part of the change, and actively work towards breaking the bias and creating transformed workplaces underpinned by diversity, equity and inclusivity.
