Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said former Lagos State governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu is always ready to push boundaries. Osinbajo said this while congratulating Tinubu on his 70th birthday on Tuesday and prayed that God would grant him strength, wisdom and favour. The vice president in a statement said Tinubu’s birthday “is a unique one indeed; the Platinum Jubilee and the completion of yet another remarkable decade. “It is also an opportune time to give thanks to God Almighty for your service to the nation – as Senator of the Federal Republic, Governor of Lagos State and a founding leader of the All Progressives Congress. “In confronting the many challenges which came with the transition to democracy in 1999, you showed leadership and were always ready to push the boundaries. Not only did you query the limitations which had beset our federalism, you actively encouraged the use of the legal process in clarifying the constitution. “Asiwaju, your decades of sterling contributions in the public and political spheres are remarkable. In particular, your endeavours in the advancement of federalism, electoral reform, and party organisation have helped to enrich our democratic experience. “We join your entire family, friends and associates to celebrate you on your 70th birthday and we pray that as your days, so shall your strength, wisdom and favour with God be.”
