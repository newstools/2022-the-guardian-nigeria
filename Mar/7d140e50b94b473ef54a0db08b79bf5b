The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) sustained a sliding profile at the reopening of transactions, yesterday, as many blue-chip stocks, especially Niger Insurance and AIICO depreciated in price, resulting in a further decline in market capitalisation by N4 billion. The All-Share Index (ASI) declined by 6.00 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.01 per cent, to close at 47,262.61 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N3 billion to close at N25.472 trillion. The market’s negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks, which are: Seplat Energy, Africa Prudential, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN), NASCON Allied Industries (NASCON) and Unilever Nigeria. On market outlook, analysts at GTI Securities Limited said: “Trading activities began the week on a negative note, bringing about four consecutive days of losses. Bulls are expected to return to the market given the spate of corporate actions, we anticipate improved market activity to encourage a bullish response next week.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “We saw increased activity in high dividend yield stocks today especially in the banking sector, amid positioning in names like UBA and Zenith Bank. We expect similar trade patterns to filter into tomorrow, as investors continue to trade in line with corporate disclosures.” However, market sentiment, as measured by market breadth, was positive as 19 stocks declined, while 18 recorded price appreciation.
