The Havana singer shared a photo of herself in a colourful layered dress hugging a young girl. She captioned the photo “2 facts: it’s my birthday and this album is my whole f—ing heart. FAMILIA. Out April 8.” Soon after, she shared a selfie video of herself on her Instagram story and wrote, “One of my intentions today is to receive all this love From my friends and family and all of you who support me, love on me and cheer me on. Grateful for all of it and taking it in today.” Back in July, the singer released the first single off the Familia album titled Don’t Go Yet, which she sang about embracing her Cuban-Mexican heritage. Speaking of the single to Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, she said that she wanted the song, and the entire album, to “manifest collective joy.” “I want it to be that kind of family affair selfishly because it would make me happy. It would make my life better, and that’s what I want, so that’s really what I was trying to manifest with this whole album,” she explained. “I think ‘Don’t Go Yet’ is just sonically and melodically just me being free. I think being in Miami for so long and having more family around me and speaking Spanish more just kind of brought me back. I think my roots went deeper in a way that I really needed.” The singer and Ed Sheeran had earlier this week teased their new single “Bam Bam” and shared a clip from the music video, set to be released today.
