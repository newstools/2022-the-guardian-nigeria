One of our weaknesses as human beings is to live in denial of what is so obvious, and of ancient-long convictions in different cultures in our world. I am referring to the concept of reincarnation.

Without the knowledge of it, understanding the love and justice will remain deficient, if indeed not nigh impossible. Man will continue unwittingly to infer chance happenings in experiences of people, their fortune and misfortune. What amounts to arbitrariness on the part of the Creator is read into fateful consequences that assail us human beings and the veiled accusatory note is voiced against our Maker and Lord: “Why me?” We can all see how intensified evil sweeping through the world even in variants never thought possible, yet we do not expect harvests of the consequences of the acts of evil. It is believed that a person can be lawless as much as it pleases him and all he needs to do is to supplicate the Creator for the forgiveness of his shortcomings. Leaders of the religion he claims and acquaintances also gather to join the plea for forgiveness. A man who does not profess any spiritual values has an assembly of such clergymen beseech the Highest for same. Yet, we are told the Lord cannot be mocked. Everyone bears responsibility for his deeds and thoughts which lead him upwards or downwards. If good and ennobling these lead upwards to the heights and if base and evil downwards to damnation. The fateful consequences can arrive in this present earth-life or in the next one. The incorruptible and self-enforcing, perfect eternal Laws of Creation see to all that. All actions and thoughts are imprinted on the soul of each person as his own page in the Book of Life, the page presented as the scorecard. As we now learn from the higher and unique knowledge existing on earth in the present time: “…the direction of men’s fate is always determined by themselves alone through their wishes and volition, and that the Creator does not look on and intervene to reward or punish.” It is thus plainly stated: “Tribulation, despair and destruction are always and only the lawful reciprocal effects of wrong actions.” The greater part of the reciprocal effects takes place in Beyond. This means human beings have seen nothing yet. The harvest that is experienced on earth is crushing enough, the fruits of actions perpetrated in former earth live, in cosmic past and in even contemporary past considering the speed cycles are now closing evinced in the acceleration of events. As I said last week, the phenomenon of whiz kiddies that holds us stupefied, spell-bound and askance can only be explained through reincarnation. In this day and age, the age of technological wonders, how can anyone be talking about reincarnation? The generous at heart refers to the Biblical passage that it is given unto man to die but once, after which comes judgment. While the passage is correct, it is the understanding and interpretation that are deficient. Death refers not to earthly death when the earthly body is discarded for a number of reasons which include old age, illness, accidents, carelessness or state-sanctioned death. Death that the Bible refers to is the final death, spiritual death when a man’s name is erased from the Book of Life. Evidence of reincarnation? I want to believe that Yetunde, Nnene, Nnena, Babatunde, Babajide, Iyabode, Iyatunde, Olusoji, Olutunde, Olatunde, Olatunji and Babawande will not ask me such question. There are names given to babes thought to be reincarnations of relations who had passed away. The concept of reincarnation exists in practically all cultures. Those who give the names may not always be correct about the details, they are correct about the concept. In addition in every case, it is each child that whispers its name to its mother or the person who is receptive enough to receive the name for christening as everyone is the name he bears containing its talents and abilities as well as its path which it is to work on or build upon. Nevertheless, here is a classical example apart from the numerous ones to which in the culture and tradition of the Nigerian people attest eloquently. The report was published in the internet and originally posted by Tara MacIsaac, Epoch Times, May 17, 2014. “A three-year-old boy in Golan Heights region near the border of Syria and Israel said he was murdered with an axe in his previous earth life. OK, so what? Children claim to have a memory of silly things all the time, and are known to play with their imaginary friends, right? “He then proceeded to show to the village elders where the murderer buried his body, and sure enough they found a man’s skeleton there. He also showed the elders where the murder weapon could be found, and upon digging they found an axe there. “In his book, Children Who Have Lived Before: Reincarnation Today, German therapist Trutz Hardo tells this boy’s story along with other stories of children who seem to remember their past lives with verified accuracy. The boy’s story was witnessed by Dr. Eli Lasch who is best known for developing the medical system in Gaza as part of Israeli Government operation in the 1960s. Dr. Lasch who died in 2009 had recounted these astounding events of Hardo. “The boy was of the Druze ethnic group, and in his culture, the existence of reincarnation is accepted, his story nonetheless had the power to surprise his community. This is because his story contained pieces of information that he had no possible way of knowing which were verified to be true. When he was old enough to talk he told his family he had been killed by a blow to the head with an axe. It is customary for elders to take a child at the age of three to the home of his previous life if he remembers it. “After arriving at the village the boy was able to remember all the details of the village and the name of the person he was in a previous life. A village local said the man the boy claimed to be the reincarnation had gone missing four years earlier. His friends and family thought he may have strayed into hostile territory nearby as it sometimes happens. Here is where it gets cool. The boy also remembered the full name of his killer, and confronted the man who had killed him in a past life! The murderer’s face turned white, although he did not yet admit to the crime. The boy then said he could take the elders to where the body was buried. In that very spot, they found a man’s skeleton with a wound to the head that corresponded to the boy’s birthmark. Nearby also found the axe that was used as the murder weapon. The murderer then admitted to the crime after being faced with this evidence. Dr. Lasch was present through the whole process and testifies to the story.” One other story that has remained intriguing is the Abraham Lincoln and John Kennedy puzzle. Several people have found certain aspects of their lives confounding and the question being asked is whether Lincoln and John Kennedy were the same and one person. Both were two outstanding United States Presidents. Abraham Lincoln was the 16th U.S. President while Kennedy was the 35th. But there were very striking, indeed, astounding similarities in certain aspects of their lives and their deaths. Lincoln made abolition of slavery prevalent in the South a Presidential campaign issue. He stood for his country’s union which angered the confederates at the time. It was indeed one of the confederates that assassinated him. The assassination of Kennedy was totally unexpected. He was one of the most loved Presidents in American history and his death reverberated around the world. I recall that Adeolu Akinsanya, a Nigerian music maestro, composed a moving song paying glowing tribute to John F. Kennedy’s human rights struggle for the emancipation of the Blacks and all victims of human rights abuses. A posting that first surfaced in 2017 has once again been brought to my attention, drawing attention to the enigmatic similarities in crucial aspects of the lives of the two awesome American heroes. The posting was expressly directed at a history teacher. As I did say at the time I am neither a historian nor a history teacher. That I discussed the history of Lagos, the land of Aworis at the time was not sufficient to make me a historian or a history teacher. The posting I received to which my attention has been drawn again reads as follows: “Please, can a history teacher explain this: Abraham Lincoln was elected to Congress in 1946. John F. Kennedy was elected to Congress in 1946. Abraham Lincoln was elected President in 1860;
John F. Kennedy was elected President in 1960.
Both were particularly concerned with civil rights.
Both their wives lost a child while living in the White House.
Both Presidents were shot in the head.
Now it gets really weird.
Lincoln secretary was named Kennedy.
Kennedy’s secretary was named Lincoln.
Both were assassinated by Southerners.
Both were succeeded by Southerners named Johnson.
Andrew Johnson who succeeded Lincoln was born in 1808;
Lyndon Johnson who succeeded Kennedy was born in 1908.
John Wikes Booth who assassinated Lincoln was born in 1839.
Lee Harvey Oswald who assassinated Kennedy was born in 1939.
Both assassins were known by their three names.
Both names were composed of fifteen letters.
Now hang on to your seats:
Lincoln was shot at the theatre named ‘Ford.’
Kennedy was shot in a car called ‘Lincoln’ made by Ford.
Booth and Oswald were assassinated before their trials.
And here is the ‘kicker’
A week before Lincoln was shot, he was in Monroe, Maryland.
A week before Kennedy was shot, he was with Marilyn Monroe.
AND
Lincoln was shot in a theatre and the assassin ran into a warehouse.
Kennedy was shot in a warehouse and the assassin ran to a theatre.” The subject matter is not so much a historical matter but spiritual. To solve the riddle we must have the basic knowledge of who we are as human beings, the mechanisms with which the Almighty Creator govern His creation; His Love, Mercy and Justice, and the correlation between love and Justice. Knowledge of the phenomenon called reincarnation without which mankind cannot grasp the Love and Justice of Almighty God. The explanations for the prodigies are as much tied to reincarnation as the riddle of Lincoln and John F. Kennedy is. Who are the faces behind the masks? The cycle of events is every 100 years. Who are the personalities behind the veils? Are they one or two is a subject for another day. Dr. Stephen Lampe, author of Christian and Reincarnation, in addition to the work, Future Societies, says: “To millions of Christians, reincarnation is a familiar word. This is not surprising since reincarnation is the belief of literally billions (thousands of millions) of human beings on earth today…surely, the belief of such a huge number of people of all races, poor and rich, illiterate and erudite, low and high, oriental and western  and belonging to various religions, including Christians and sects, deserve serious study and reflection.” And he says of prodigies: “The education and skills we acquire now will determine our future accomplishments.” It is these foundational preparation and accomplishments that are the stuff of which prodigies are made from previous lives to dazzle our world of today.
