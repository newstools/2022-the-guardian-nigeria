Determined to improve access to power supply, Renewvia Solar Nigeria Ltd., a solar developer, has installed and connected five communities in the Niger Delta to one of its solar-powered, rural electrification mini grids.
   
With these new installations, Renewvia had connected nearly 2,000 households, which serves over 10,000 individuals and businesses through thousands of metered connections in eight communities in the region.
   
The five new communities include Balep, Bendeghe-Afi, Ekong Anaku, Opu, and Emeroke are located in Cross River and Akwa Ibom States. Other communities already connected to a Renewvia mini-grid include Oloibiri and Akipelia in Bayelsa State and Obokwu Ozuzu in Rivers State, also in the Niger Delta region. 
 
Oloibiri’s case is particularly interesting as it is the location where oil was first discovered in Nigeria, and yet had no reliable and affordable power until Renewvia’s minigrid enabled access to electricity.  “We are optimistic that the installed solar hybrid system will continue to positively impact on safety and wellbeing, productivity, gender equality, health and enterprise across these communities.
   
“Our impact extends beyond providing access to cleaner, reliable, and affordable energy, but also in helping Nigeria actualise her global energy transition mandate of cutting carbon emissions towards net-zero by 2060 as declared at the recently concluded Climate Change Conference (COP 26).”
 
The project is Renewvia’s execution of the Nigeria Electrification Project (NEP), sponsored by the Federal Government of Nigeria, through its Implementing Agency – Rural Electrification Agency (REA). 
 
NEP is designed to provide clean, safe and reliable electricity, spur economic growth through increased productivity and elevate the living condition of thousands of rural residents and enterprises in the Nigeria Delta communities.
