Reacting to market performance, analysts at GTI Securities Limited said: “The week starts with a reverse of the last trading session, as sell-off persists across all sectors. We expect this to continue this week, with uncertainties hovering around the equity market.” United Capital also said: “This week, we expect to see continued profit-taking on positions that have appreciated, while investors reduce market exposure as dividend season gradually draws to a close. We retain a preference for investors to continue to seek selling opportunities to reduce exposure to the domestic equities market.” Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “As expected, the week started mixed with the banking sector taking the most hit, despite trades in that space dominating the activity chart.
