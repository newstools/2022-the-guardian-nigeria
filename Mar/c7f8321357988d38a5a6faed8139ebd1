Sir: As the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination are about to start soonest, there’s a surfeit number of knots that should be unsnarled insofar we want to hatch a productive society where students that are trekking on the ladder of joining tertiary institutions would be celebrating when the results are released. Thereby, fading the unfortunate scores produced by the students in the past, precisely 2021, especially in the northern part of the country where the students were fooled due to lack of exposure, orientation and so forth.
 
But it’s clearly out of doubt that the society where we live can be said to be the most threatening factor and the body responsible for the massive failure the students have been producing. It’s very unbecoming that we are now living in a society where one would be advised not to read for examination and pray for luck; a society where one would be advised to choose ‘As’ from question 1 to 10, and ‘Bs’, from 11 to 20; a mysterious society where those that read for JAMB are the laughing stocks of the public.
