Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, the former model and mom of two talked about her feelings post-treatment. She told Entertainment Tonight, “I finished my IVF part, so I feel so much healthier and so much better with that.” Back in February, Teigen first revealed that she was undergoing IVF, about a year and a half after her devastating pregnancy loss. Taking to Instagram, she wrote, “I wanted to let you guys know I’m balls deep in another IVF cycle to save as many eggs as I possibly can and hopefully make some strong, healthy embryos.” “I honestly don’t mind the shots…they make me feel like a doctor/chemist. But the bloating is a bitch, so I humbly beg you to stop asking if I’m pregnant.” In September 2020, Teigen revealed that she lost her 20-week old pregnancy to excessive bleeding. “We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before. We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions. It just wasn’t enough,” she wrote on Instagram. Following her loss, the Lip Sync Battle star became sober and also discussed with ET how she’ll navigate the 2022 awards season without alcohol. “These things are very weird for me because I’m so used to getting so hammered at these things,” she told “ET,” explaining, “Awards season, I very much connect to enjoying yourself and having champagne, but I also connected with those feelings of immense regret or stupid moments.” John Legend and Chrissy Teigen got married in 2013 after meeting on the music video set for Stereo in 2007, and they have two children; Luna and Steff.
