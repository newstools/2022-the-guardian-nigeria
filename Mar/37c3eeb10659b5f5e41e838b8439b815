The leader of the Yoruba nation separatist movement, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has urged his followers and kinsmen to embrace dialogue in the quest for self-determination. Igboho, who stated this, yesterday, in a statement signed by his lawyer, Yomi Alliyu (SAN), noted that the ambition of self-determination could be achieved without firing a bullet or heating up the fragile situation in Nigeria. He assured those in support of peaceful self-determination through referendum that the struggle continues, as he will not relent in his efforts in that regard. Igboho thanked his supporters, which include Prof Banji Akintoye, Prof. Wale Adeniran, Dele Momodu and the President of Benin Republic, Patrice Talon, for releasing him from the prison with a view to uniting him with members of his immediate family, albeit only in Cotonou for the time being.
