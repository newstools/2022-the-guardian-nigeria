625 violent attacks recorded in Plateau, says coalition Chairman of Donga Local Council in Taraba State, Nashuka Musa, yesterday, confirmed the death of 26 persons in the Tor-Damisa community. Also, the traditional head of the community, Zaki Uma, said: “So far, we have recovered 26 corpses.” He added that majority of the victims were women and children. Yesterday’s attack was believed to be a reprisal, following a previous attack by Tiv farmers on herders. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abdullahi Usman, confirmed the incident, saying there was an attack in one of the communities in Donga, adding: “We are on top of the situation.” Witnesses said the herders stormed the community armed with sophisticated weapons and shot indiscriminately at people. MEANWHILE, armed bandits in Plateau State reportedly carried out about 625 attacks in the last 20 years, a coalition of minority rights groups has said. The coalition disclosed this following rejection of a bill at the Senate, last week, to change the name of Barkin Ladi Local Council. Speaking to journalists in Abuja, yesterday, the convener of the coalition, Reverend James Pam, said: “We want the public to know that the people of this council have experienced the highest number of assaults by herders, as documented by Stefanos Foundation, a member of our coalition, between 2001 and 2020. They recorded a total of 625 attacks, with 151 of them (that is 24 per cent) taking place in Barkin Ladi.”
