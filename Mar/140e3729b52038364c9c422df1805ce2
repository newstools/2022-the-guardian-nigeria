These activities do not always end in sex, but can lead to it.”   Growing just as popular as sexual liberation, sexual identity orientation, the hoe phase typically occurs before you get into a serious relationship. For many people, this is the time in their life when they get to explore, find what they like, who they like and figure out how these greatly help in defining their choice of partner. What does the hoe phase entail? While some people argue that this phase, as described, is simply an excuse for immorality, for some other people, this is the time to embrace freedom and adventure before spending the rest of their lives with one person. Another detail the latter group points out is that the idea that you sleep with a lot of people doing your hoe phase can be misleading. Some people prefer to take out this time to meet and date as many people as they can to explore their options, in some cases not having sexual relations with them. So, rather than generalising, it seems fair to agree with Urban’s Dictionary description that these interactions do not usually end up in sex, but that’s not to say that it doesn’t lead to it. As people have taken more time to figure out their sexual preferences, they viewed the hoe phase as the pause they needed to rewind or play on with their lives. So how does the hoe phase help? The hoe phase gives one the chance to really learn about themselves; during this phase, you typically begin to learn things you might not have known, especially regarding sexual preferences. At this time, you start to figure out your ‘type.’ Who are you more attracted to, what pleases you or doesn’t and what stimulates you not just sexually but also emotionally. Another popular assumption is that exploring the hoe phase provides a much higher chance of being faithful when you eventually fall in love and sett;e/ Some believe that going through the hoe phase increases one’s chances of being faithful when you finally decide to bury all of that and fall in love and settle with one partner. However, for anyone who has gone through the hoe phase, the amount of self-confidence this phase comes with cannot be denied. You are more in tune with yourself and feel even more liberated. When does it start? While there’s no definite time for when this phase begins and ends, it implies different timing for different people. Some people experience this phase earlier, during their youth years, while others come into this phase after a long period of commitment. Whichever it is, the concept remains the same. There are no rules to your hoe phase, but if you intend to express your sexual liberation, do it carefully and remember not to do anything you’d regret. Our advise is to use this period to get to know yourself, what you want and who you like. If that includes going on a few dates, you could, but play it carefully if you intend to go a step further.
