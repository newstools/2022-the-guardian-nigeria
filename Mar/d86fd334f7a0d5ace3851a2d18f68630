The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has reviewed its Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for better welfare package and enhanced security for corps members and officials during elections. NYSC’s Director-General, Major General Shuaibu Ibrahim, during the signing of the document, yesterday in Abuja, said the involvement of corps members in the nation’s electoral process had engendered more credibility. He promised that the scheme will continue to sustain the relationship, adding that the corps members were ever willing to contribute their quota to the development of the country, especially in the enthronement of credible elections. INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said Nigeria “is fortunate to have a scheme called NYSC,” adding that its participation in previous elections nationwide was commendable. “I cannot imagine the conduct of credible elections happening in Nigeria without the NYSC. Youth corps members are among the most educated, most committed, most patriotic and the most readily available election-duty staff in Nigeria,” he observed.
