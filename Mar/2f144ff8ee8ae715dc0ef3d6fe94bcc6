Some of Nigeria’s biggest golfers have arrived in Jos, Plateau State, to be part of history. Nigeria’s golf story started in Jos at the Rayfield Golf Course, which was established in 1913. And now, the iconic venue has been redesigned with the facilities upgraded to meet modern trends. Since Tuesday, everybody that matters in the country’s game have arrived in Jos for the commissioning of the newly redesigned course and also participate in the tournament organised by the club to mark the occasion. Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, who welcomed professional and amateur golfers to Jos for the occasion is currently one of the happiest hosts in the golf world. While teeing off the tournament on Tuesday, Lalong said the game of golf is associated with the historical role that mining played in the development and growth of Plateau State and Nigeria at large.
 
He said as a governor with passion for sports, including golf, he has decided to take the game to the next level, as well as harness its potential for tourism, business and relaxation.
 
Lalong, in a statement by his Director of Press and Public Affairs, Dr. Makut Simon Macham, said the redesigned Rayfield golf course is fully green and will be a legacy, which his administration will leave for the sport in the state, adding to its potential as a destination for leisure, business and hospitality.
 
The governor said peace, which has been substantially restored in the state, is very important because it has given citizens and visitors confidence to come into Plateau State for business and leisure.
