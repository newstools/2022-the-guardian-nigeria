SIR: Nigerians have a troubled history with their criminal justice system. Whether it is loud complaints that the system accommodates yawning cracks through which master criminals escape, to suspicions about the competence of those who run the system to outright outrage when those who know nothing about heinous crimes go in while the guilty escape, the entire criminal justice system seems to be one big booby trap.
  
Many Nigerians cite the struggles of the criminal justice system as the chief reason why the country continues to lurch from insecurity to insecurity, cutting down many people in the process.
  
How, many ask, would bandits, Boko Haram or ISWAP for example, freely operate if their kingpins and foot soldiers are clinically and constantly arrested, prosecuted, convicted and incarcerated?
