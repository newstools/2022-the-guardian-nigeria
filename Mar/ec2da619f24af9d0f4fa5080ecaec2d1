One week after the launch of TerragonPrime, a tech solution developed by Data and Marketing Technology Company, Terragon, to help Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) drive intelligent customer acquisition, over 1000 businesses have shown interest in the platform.
  
TerragonPrime is a cloud-based multi-channel marketing platform, helping businesses deliver data-driven, intelligent and cost-effective offline (SMS) and online (WhatsApp) customer acquisition and engagement campaigns, directly on mobile.
  
The platform also helps SMEs improve advertising campaign performance and acquire customers cost-effectively, leveraging the power of data.
 
Terragon said though the platform is still in its beta phase, it has however seen huge market acceptance by Small and Medium-Sized Businesses, who have shown excitement about the platform’s ability to segment Nigerian customers by criteria such as age, location, interest, and engage with them through SMS and WhatsApp, amongst others. Terragon’s Senior Vice President, Products and Product Marketing, Oti Ukubeyinje, explained that the high uptake within such a short period since the platform debuted might not be unconnected with the unrivalled features.
