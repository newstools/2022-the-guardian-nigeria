Once more Dubai has added to the list of must see architectural buildings and given more reasons to plan that next trip to Dubai the “City of Gold”. Unlike the traditional forms of museums that houses and preserve old artefacts and paintings of centuries ago, the “Museum of the Future” as the name implies is true to tell of the exhibits housed in the museum that took 6 years to be built.   The Museum Of The Future showcases space innovations and futuristic ideations. The Museum Of The Future comprises three main features; a green hill which symbolically stands for the earth with a solid foundation, the building which represents a firm establishment and the third feature being the void, speaks of time and history. The view of The Museum Of The Future stands as a true beauty of art making it one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. The building is brilliantly graced with Arabic scripts of ajami scripted on the body of the cowry shaped structure. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1685151 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-957x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="800" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-957x598.jpg 957w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-1843x1152.jpg 1843w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-1536x960.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-2048x1280.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-320x200.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-640x400.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BIM-Portale-600x375.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> This rare structure is shaped like an eye or a cowry, with a space that peers through the possibilities and prospects of the future of humanity. As the museum holds the views into the future, the awe-gasping building takes centre stage with other jaw-dropping futuristic buildings that Dubai usually gives. With its ambitious view, it has found its position as one of the 14 most beautiful museums in the world.  The museum comprises seven floors all dedicated to different exhibitions. The museum of the future holds futuristic objects like a cyber dog, a rainforest, and a space station. It is a museum but much more like being the birthplace and household for innovations, futuristic ideas. Thus The Museum Of The Future is a shelter for designers, innovators and researchers, consequently being that safe space for the young ones to explore their curious minds. This varies in math, physics, labs and space travel. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1685156 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-897x598.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="854" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-897x598.jpg 897w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-1728x1152.jpg 1728w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-1536x1024.jpg 1536w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-2048x1365.jpg 2048w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-320x213.jpg 320w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-640x427.jpg 640w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/The-Architects-Newspaper-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /> Although the building is a scientific wonder, it is merged with a rich display of the culture of the people through the Arabic inscription on the body. The writings translate into a poem by Dubai’s ruler and it is about the Emirate’s future. The inscriptions simply read that “We may not live for hundreds of years, but the product of our creativity can leave a legacy long after we are gone. The future belongs to those who can imagine it, design it and execute it. The future does not wait. The future can be designed and built today. The secret of the renewal of life, the development of civilisation and the progress of mankind is in one word: Innovation.” The exhibitions of the museum explore a theme in 2050 that will vehicle humanity, showing how man will thrive when it becomes fundamentally ground-breaking in ideas. The museum aims to proffer solutions to disputes affecting future cities.
