Arsenal legend, Robert Pires, has hailed Mikel Arteta for helping his former club rediscover their ‘DNA’. The Gunners endured a difficult start to the season and were bottom of the table after their losing opening three Premier League matches. However, they’ve since turned their form around and are in pole position to finish fourth and bring Champions League football back to the Emirates Stadium for the first time since the 2016/17 season. Despite winning the FA Cup and Community Shield during his tenure at the club, Arteta has often found himself under intense pressure to restore Arsenal to the heady heights they achieved under former boss Arsene Wenger. Nonetheless Pires, who won two league titles during his spell with the Gunners, has been impressed with the Spaniard’s work, and is confident that his old side are heading in the right direction. “I still follow Arsenal, I watch all the games and I am in contact with the sporting director Edu and Mikel and many other former players,” he told Goal.com. “I think he is doing a great job. Arsenal have found their DNA based on a fast and attacking game. He asks a lot of his players and is very demanding, starting from the training sessions.” With no European or cup commitments, Arsenal solely have the league to focus on, and can take another step towards a top four finish when they welcome Leicester to the Emirates today.
