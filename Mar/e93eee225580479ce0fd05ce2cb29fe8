Sir: Your Excellency, I’m writing to implore, as well as draw your attention to the dilapidated condition of the Galtimari by-pass road. The road is in need of an urgent intervention to ease transportation and decongest traffic in the metropolis. The 3.2km road links Gombole-village, Fori, and Tashan-Bama, among other areas. It has been the easiest route for students, traders, motorists as well as tricyclists within the Maiduguri metropolis.
 
The Galtimari by-pass road was constructed around 2019, under Kashim Shettima’s watch, and was commissioned by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo. Awfully, in less than three years, the road has completely gone bad because it was not properly constructed by the clients and contractors.
 
Your Excellency, it may shock you to hear that the current dilapidated situation of the road has added to the predicaments of your beloved citizens, especially students.  • Shettima Lawan Monguno wrote from Maiduguri, Borno State.
