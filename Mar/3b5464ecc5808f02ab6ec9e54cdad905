The crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is yet to abate as High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has restrained the party from proceeding with its planned national convention scheduled for March 26. This followed an order by Justice Bello Kawu, who restrained the party from going ahead with its national convention pending the determination of the suit marked FHC/HC/CV/2958/202. But a source said the party has concluded arrangement to ensure the court vacate the order by Thursday. Mr. Salisu Umoru had dragged the APC, the Chairman Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni, and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC before the court to challenge the planned convention. In the motion, No FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants, allies, agencies, representatives, associates or whoever is acting for them from organising, holding or conducting national convention of the APC in January and February or at any other date either before or after, pending the hearing and determination of the suit. The claimant informed the court that the mere inauguration of sub-committees for the March 26 National Convention when the order of the honourable court is in force is a demonstration of disdain for the rule of law in the country. While March 30, 2022 was fixed for the continuation of hearing of the substantive suit, no date has been fixed for the commencement of contempt proceedings against the APC. The claimant also commended INEC for standing by the provisions of the law and the order of the court, which is still in force.
