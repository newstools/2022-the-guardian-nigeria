Sir: The Lagos State government needs to change its process of getting those truly deserving of awards in the state’s civil service. Most of the time, awards are given to those who do not deserve or merit them in any way and this continues to dampen the morale of truly hardworking civil servants. The apparatus to get the best workers should include nominations and votes from workers themselves.
