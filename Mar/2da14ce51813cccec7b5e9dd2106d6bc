Kaduna State police command has arrested two people for maltreating a 12-year-old housemaid, Rosemary, in Ungwan Takama, Maraba Rido area of the state.
   
The Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Sabo Police Division, Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP) Olu  Arowoshegbe, confirmed that Ms. Laitu Adamu and her sister (name withheld) have been arrested on allegation of  maltreatment and domestic violence against the little girl.  
   
The DPO told The Guardian that the victim has been taken into custody by the state’s Women Affairs Ministry. He stated that the housemaid implicated Ahmadu’s sister as the second culprit, who inflicted injuries on her.
   
Ahmadu was reported by a concerned neighbour on February 26, 2022, after several attempts made to caution her failed.
   
The Guardian had on February 27, 2022, reported the case and informed the police to arrest the culprit.  After receiving the report, the Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Mojammed Jalinge, followed up the case, but the culprit absconded from her residence.
   
Jalinge, however, promised that police officers will remain in the vicinity to arrest her anytime she returns, promising that necessary legal actions will be taken against the suspects.
