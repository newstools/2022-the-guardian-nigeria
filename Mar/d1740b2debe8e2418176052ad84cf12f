Osinbajo advocates compulsory health insurance, private sector funding Nigeria requires about N2.7 trillion over a 10-year period to reinvigorate its Primary Healthcare Centres, said National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA) boss, Dr. Faisal Shuaib. The Executive Secretary made this known, yesterday, during a summit organised by the agency in Abuja. Already, about N1.3 trillion has been invested  by government, donors and the private sector, leaving a gap of N1.4 trillion. He said the agency is leveraging on the historic coalition of government donors and the organised private sector to secure required resources. Also speaking at the event, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo advocated compulsory health insurance in the country to provide quality, accessible and affordable care services for Nigerians. He said: “There is no way government’s budget alone can fund the health sector. There is great need for synergy from private sectors, partners and the Federal Government to avoid duplication of primary healthcare facilities.” He added: “COVID-19 was an eye opener for me in at least five important respects. The first is that health challenge of sufficient enormity can cripple the global economy and severely worsen the circumstances of the weakest economy and the most vulnerable groups.” Also, Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, observed that Nigeria needs at least one functional primary health care centre in all local council areas, stressing that 70 per cent of diseases can be managed at primary health centres, thereby reducing the burden on secondary health facilities.
