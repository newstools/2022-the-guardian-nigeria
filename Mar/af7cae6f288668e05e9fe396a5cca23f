The Lagos Police Command has tightened security around the Dangote Refinery, which was attacked by armed Hoodlums on Monday morning. The Dangote refinery nearing completion in the Lekki free trade zone area of Lagos State with 650,000 barrels per day (BPD), was attacked by 20 hoodlums before operatives of the Lagos Police repel the attack. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Benjamin Hundeyin, told The Guardian, yesterday, that the hoodlums gained access into the facility to steal amoured cables, before security men intercepted them. He said, “Some shootings occurred, one of them was hit, and others escaped. They were about 20 in number. The one that was hit died on the way to the hospital. “Security around that area has been fortified and investigation has begun. No arrest has been made.” The police spokesperson added that investigations are ongoing and findings would be available to the public soon. Reacting to the attack on Twitter, a user, @KanteCesc said: “The attempted assault on Dangote Refinery and the train attack isn’t a coincidence” “The agenda is visible even to the blind. It will never be well with ALL the enemies of Nigeria. Amin” @Ismail_dimejy said: “ We have a common enemy and the govt should treat the situation as such. An attack on public infrastructure is an attack to us all, imagine the police having to rebuff attacks on the Dangote refinery already !!! ….it is sad.”
