Canada on Thursday revoked special trading status for Russia and Belarus over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, resulting in 35 percent tariffs being slapped on their imports, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland announced. “Canada will be the first country to revoke Russia’s and Belarus’s most favored nation status as a trading partner under Canadian law,” Freeland told a news conference. As a result, Russia and Moscow-ally Belarus “will be subjected to a tariff of 35 percent on their exports to Canada,” joining North Korea as the only other country that does not benefit from this trading status, she said.
