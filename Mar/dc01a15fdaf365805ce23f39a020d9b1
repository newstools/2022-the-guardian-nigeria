Zamfara State governor, Bello Matawalle, yesterday, expressed sadness over recent bandits’ attack on communities in Bukkuyum and Maru Local Councils of the state. According to the Police Command in Zamfara, the attackers killed 16 persons. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Matawalle, in a condolence message issued by his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications, Malam Zailani Bappa, expressed regret that the “dastardly and cowardly attack” was coming at a time when peace was fast improving in the state. The governor assured that the recent attack would not deter his administration’s efforts at achieving total peace in the state. He said: “It is unfortunate that this attack is coming at a time when we are experiencing improved peace in the state, where we were able to host millions of people in an important religious event without a single incidence. “However, this and other isolated cases of banditry across the state will not deter our efforts at ensuring a peaceful Zamfara, an oath we have taken to pursue with our fullest capability.” He consoled families of those whose lives were lost in the attack. The governor also directed the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management to immediately release relief materials to all victims of the attack and their families.
