Group of Young Nigerians, under the auspices of #TakeBackNaija# Movement, has promised the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), of over ten million votes at the 2023 presidential election if they present former Anambra State Governor, Mr. Peter Obi, as the party standard bearer. The National Coordinator of the group, Ali Mohammad, who made this known in Yenagoa after an interactive session with youth groups and other stakeholders ahead of party primaries, pleaded with the PDP leadership to consider Peter Obi as the presidential flag bearer, considering the fact that what is at stake in 2023 is beyond party politics, but a case of rescuing the about-to-collapse country. Mohammad stressed further that Nigeria was in dire need of competent leaders with proven track records of integrity in public office. In the statement made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, Mohammed pointed out that they were mobilising young and qualified Nigerians across the country to join the movement. The group said they had identified the former vice presidential candidate for the PDP at the 2019 elections, adding that Peter Obi remained the best in the party currently. They appealed to the PDP to adopt him as their consensus candidate, “he has what it would take to turn the tides of the country around going by his past record as the governor of Anambra State, and most importantly his vast knowledge on economic policy, good governance, and purposeful leadership, which is what the country lacked at the moment,” he said. The group also noted that PDP had a track record of ensuring equity and justice since her formation and should give the a sense of belonging, having not had the opportunity to produce either a president or vice president since the return of democracy in 1999.
