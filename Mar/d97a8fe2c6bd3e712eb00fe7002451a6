Although the Fifth-Generation (5G) network is still in its early days and the full potential of the technology is far from being realised, the mobile industry is already preparing for what comes next given the typical 10-year technology cycle.
  
While 5G promises download speeds many times faster than current speeds offered by 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks and significantly lower latency times, 6G is set to raise the bar even higher, with much faster speeds and increased bandwidth to keep consumers more connected than ever before.
  
According to the Global System for Mobile telecommunications Association (GSMA), there has been a flurry of announcements related to 6G in recent months, with governments and industry players outlining plans to move the concept beyond just a vision to identify use cases and roadmaps.
