Ghana’s women national team players have begun shaping up with the Ashanti Region Senior Women’s T20 League at the KNUST, Obuasi Campus Cricket Oval ahead of the the forthcoming Women’s T20 Championship billed to hold in Nigeria. White Hawks Cricket Club of Ghana Captain, Ellen Otu Asante, said after finishing last out of the four teams that played last November, her team, which shared same points (four) with Tutuka Queens, fell behind with an NRR of -1.9 as against -1.0 for Tutuka Queens. The Ghana Cricket Association, together with the Ashanti Regional Cricket Association, scheduled Saturday, February 26, through to Sunday, March 13, as dates for this year’s double round robin clashes, which is aimed at selecting the best for the upcoming international women’s tournament in Nigeria. Ellen, popularly known as Lukaku, says they have worked on their shortfalls, going into the league. “What affected us last year was our faulty bowling, which gave more extras to our opponents. We have now perfected our bowling skills and we’ll not repeat giving out wides. “This year, we just want to play a good game and avoid being last again. We also target getting half a century for most of our batters. We will play together, understand each other, listen to each other’s opinion since cricket is played in a team form, not individual.” The Hawks, who beat Tutuka Queens and defending champions, Pomposo Royals last year, opened the league with Royal Batters in the morning before hosting Pomposo Royals. The league is expected to be exciting, as national women Head coach, Obed Harvey, is among coaches there to pick the best for the tournament in Nigeria.
