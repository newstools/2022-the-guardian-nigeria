If you’re lucky enough, you may have someone who can tell you how you sleep. As wild as they can get, most sleeping positions can be classified into back, side, or stomach. Research reveals that these key sleeping positions give us clues about a person’s overall health. Hear what your sleeping position says about you. Back Sleepers If you’re a back sleeper, you’re probably used to seeing your ceiling first thing in the morning. Back sleepers are least prone to tossing and turning at night, and this usually means they sleep the deepest. Sleeping on your back is best for your spine and posture, and you are less prone to body pains because your weight is evenly distributed all through the night. Sleeping on your back is also the most preferred option after a late-night snack, as it reduces the chances of acid reflux. On the downside, sleeping with your nose in the air encourages snoring. Shockingly, there is a high chance that you become breathless at night, a condition called sleep apnea. Stomach Sleepers These usually have the funniest sleeping positions because they can’t figure out how their heads should hang. Most sleep experts advise against sleeping on your stomach because it strains the neck. Since you can’t exactly sleep with your face in a pillow, stomach sleepers have to look left or right while they sleep. It’s no surprise that they wake up with a sore neck. Sleeping on your stomach may push gastric fluid into the oesophagus, causing a disturbing burning sensation. It also aggregates lower back pain due to the depression of the spine. That aside, stomach sleeping is one of the most comfortable sleeping positions. Side Sleepers For a good reason, side sleeping is perhaps the most popular sleeping position. Sleeping on your left side can improve blood flow, digestion, brain health, reduce snoring, and guarantee you a proper rest. However, side sleepers may wake up with a numb arm, squashed face, aching chest and a sore hip. Side sleeping can be easily modified by propping these pressure points with pillows. Side sleepers must be careful not to curve their spine too much; otherwise, they risk early back pains.
