Lagos State Government, yesterday, began publication of details of sex offenders in the state. Executive Secretary of Lagos State Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency (DSVA), Mrs. Titilola Vivour-Adeniyi, who disclosed this in the agency’s office, said the publication was in furtherance of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s zero tolerance to all forms of domestic and sexual violence. According to her, the detail includes; name and pictures of the sex offender, nature of the offence as well as duration of the sentence handed down by the court. Mrs. Vivour- Adeniyi also noted that the publication was in line with provisions of the Domestic and Sexual Violence Agency Law, particularly Section 42, which provides that the agency,  periodically publishes details of sex convicts in the state. She also said letters of advice have been issued to local councils and traditional rulers of the communities where the convicts previously resided. She said: “This measure is one amongst many deployed by the state government to end the culture of impunity and also serve as a deterrence to other sex offenders. “As further provided in the law, the details of sex convicts are to be published periodically on the State Government’s website, (www.lagosstate.gov.ng), the website of the Ministry of Justice ( https://lagosstatemoj.org) and the agency’s website; ( www.dsvrtlagos.org).” The executive security reiterated government’s resolute stance in preventing incidents of sexual and domestic abuse, whilst ensuring justice for all survivors.
