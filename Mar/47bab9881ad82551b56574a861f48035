Sir, In 2015, as Nigeria approached an election that many hoped would provide a watershed moment in the history of democracy in the country, there was a great craving for change no matter what it was or who it was. For many, Nigeria’s destination under Mr. Goodluck Jonathan as president was cast in stone as a downward spiral marked by unyielding corruption and nonchalant inertia was only going to drag the country to the doldrums.
 
When at the end of a closely fought election, the Independent National Electoral Commission declared Mr. Muhammadu Buhari as winner of the polls, deep sighs of relief rose from many quarters all over the country.
 
However, the huge sighs of relief were soon replaced by surging anxiety: what was the new man bringing to the table that was different from what his successor offered and how could he radically change the way the country was set up?  • Kene Obiezu
