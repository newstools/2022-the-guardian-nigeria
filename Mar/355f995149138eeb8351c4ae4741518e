Reacting to the market’s performance, analysts at Cordros Capital said: “In the week ahead, we expect the market to trade sideways as the activities of bargain hunters in dividend-paying stocks fizzle out due to the winding down of the 2021FY earnings season. “In addition, risk-averse investors will likely sustain profit-taking activities in anticipation of an uptick in FI yields. Notwithstanding, we reiterate the need for positioning in only fundamentally sound stocks as the weak macro environment remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings. ”
