The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) says it has upgraded its Egbin 330/132/33 Kilo Volt (kV) Transmission Substation in Lagos State, with installation of a 60 Mega Volt Ampere (MVA) 132/33KV power transformer. TCN’s General Manager, Public Affairs, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, said in a statement in Abuja on Sunday that the transformer which was installed by TCN in-house engineers was energised at 13.05pm on March 2. “With the new 60MVA power transformer, the substation capacity to supply bulk electricity to Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company (IKEDC) has increased by 30MVA. “This is because TCN has decommissioned an old 30MVA transformer within the substation, which will be serviced and moved to other areas within its network that have a history of minimal electricity demand. “This substation capacity upgrade will ensure that more power is made available for IKEDC to take to its franchise areas within Ijede LCDA and Ikorodu Local Government area axis,” she said.
