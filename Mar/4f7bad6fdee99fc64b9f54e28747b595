The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers, NCRIB, has urged Lagos State Government to pay more attention to insurance of markets across the state, in order to provide safety and succour for victims in the event of the aftermath of losses to human and material assets.
 
The group harped on accelerated sanitary initiatives, especially in vulnerable areas of the state and more aggressive public campaigns on how citizens could become more responsible for their assets and those of the government.
