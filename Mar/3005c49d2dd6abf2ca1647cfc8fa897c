The Club Cricket Committee (CCC) has urged corporate bodies and governments at all levels to identify with cricket and ensure the country is recognised as the best in the sport in Africa.
 
Speaking on plans to raise the standard of the sport in Lagos at the weekend, CCC Chairman, Akin Denton, noted that the committee is working with stakeholders to budget for the forthcoming Super Four Championship.  “The sponsor of this league is Gbolahan Olusegun, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly. We are open to whoever it is that sees us as a vehicle that would add value to cricket in Nigeria,” he said.
   
On the match schedule and facilities, Denton said: “Every club is playing two matches every weekend because we don’t have much money. There are so many games to be played and the number of available pitches are not exactly too many. “This year we are playing on three pitches, including the Tafawa Balewa Square oval, UNILAG and CMS Grammar School. There are other competing issues for these pitches and as such, if we want to finish playing the league before the rain starts, we will find it necessary to compress it. That is why some teams play back to back and every team will have to do so for us to get the games in before the rain starts at the end of April.”
