Founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank and President and Founder, Anap Foundation, Atedo Peterside, has called on Nigerian men to support women, saying both genders are critical to the sustainability of the country. He spoke just as a protest, ‘One Million March” holds today in response to the rejection of women’s rights bills by the National Assembly last week. Peterside said: “If you do not appreciate your mother, then I am sorry for you. It is time to rethink; confident men should support our women because we need them at the table.” Notable Nigerians, apart from Peterside, have expressed their support for the campaign. He believes that confident men should show interest in the wellbeing of the female gender. Peterside’s position comes as Anap Foundation continues its enlightenment campaign, themed GoNigeria, a campaign to sensitise youths to the election of visionary leaders. GoNigeria is an initiative of Anap Foundation, a non-profit organisation committed to promoting good governance. The Foundation is partnering enlightened celebrities (GoAmbassadors), corporate bodies eager to support the initiative via co-branding (GoPartners) as well as many enthusiastic young volunteers (GoVolunteers), who will help to relay the message to their age mates, towards ensuring a huge success is attained in encouraging youths to register and vote en-masse in the 2023 elections.
