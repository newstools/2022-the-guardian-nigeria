The president’s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, had on March 1, in a statement said that from Kenya, the president would proceed to London for ”routine medical checks that will last for a maximum of two weeks.” However, the president returned to Abuja on Friday at about 1.p.m. before embarking on the London trip on March 6. While in London, the president was believed to have met with the Interim National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Committee (CECC), Mai Mala Buni. The president, at the end of the London meeting with Buni, called on Governors of the All progressives Congress (APC) to stop further utterances that lead to disunity ahead of the National Convention. A statement by the President’s spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, on Wednesday in Abuja, said the president made the call via a letter he personally signed, and addressed to Gov. Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State. Bagudu is also the Chairman of the Progressives Governors Forum.
