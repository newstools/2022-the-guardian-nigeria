The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, has ruled out extension of this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) beyond March 26. Oloyede made the declaration during an inspection tour of the registration centres, yesterday, in Kano. According to him, the board has so far registered over 1.4 million candidates, expressing satisfaction with the smooth conduct of the exercise in the North West and other parts of the country he has visited. He said: “We are not going to extend the period of the registration, because the candidates who will write JAMB are the same candidates who will write West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASCE) and National Examinations Council (NECO) tests. “The only space available for JAMB is the period we are utilising for the registration and for the conduct of the examination. Therefore, it will not be possible for us to extend.” He warned candidates to register before the closing date adding: “We expect other candidates to came and register within the stipulated time. We are not going to succumb to any pressure after closing it on March 26.”
