Dukka has announced the launch of its graduate internship program, the DIP Fellows. This fellowship is currently targeted at entry level talents, who seek to pursue a software engineering career in technology. The first two cohorts of this fellowship were run in stealth mode, and with Dukka’s call for application for cohort 3, it expects applications from suitably qualified candidates. According to Founder and CEO of Dukka, Keturah Ovio, “Our ethos is founded on the belief that anyone with a curious and logical mind and having the right attitude to learn can indeed be transformed into a revered engineer in a short period of time. “After running two successful cohorts, it is time for us to officially launch this fellowship as we are very pleased to have created a graduate internship program that truly works. “If there is one thing startups and even big corporations share in common, it is sourcing for high potential talents at the entry level, and attracting top talents at intermediate to senior levels. Dukka is solving its own engineering deficit problem through DIP Fellows.” According to him, DIP Fellows’ call for application is officially live as of today and this call closes on the 17th of March, 2022. The next cohort will kick off on the 4th of April, 2022. To apply, visit www.dipfellows.org to get started. It is noteworthy to mention that the DIP Fellows website was wholly designed by a current DIP Fellow.
