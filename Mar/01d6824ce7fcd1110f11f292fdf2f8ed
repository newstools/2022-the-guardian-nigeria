• Sets up committee to resolve Edo crisis
• Presidential aspirants to pay N40m for nomination forms
• Youths get 50% reduction
• Sale of forms begins today at all offices Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has set up a 37-member committee to determine suitable zoning formula for all elective offices, particularly the Presidency, Senate Presidency and House of Representatives Speakership. Rising from its 95th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, last night, the party announced that the committee had been given two weeks to submit its report for consideration. The committee, which had its membership drawn from all the states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) would elect its chairman. It was learnt that the issue of zoning generated so much rancour at the meeting to the extent that making adecision became impossible. The only saving grace, according to a source, was to set up a committee where all stakeholders will be represented. An earlier committee, presided over by Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, had recommended that the party’s presidential ticket be thrown open to all zones. Some presidential aspirants, like former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, had canvassed a no-zoning formula while others, like Sam Ohuabunwa, had asked the party to zone the Presidency to the South East. Reading a communiqué issued at the end of the NEC meeting yesterday,  PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, explained that the party had commenced full preparations for the 2023 general elections. To that extent, the NEC approved the PDP Electoral Guidelines for the conduct of primary elections as well as the timetable and schedule of activities is for the 2023 general elections. Ologunagba also said that the NEC had approved a 50 per cent reduction in nomination fees for youths aged 25 to 30 years for various elective positions. “NEC also approved the commencement of sale of Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms from today, March 17, 2022,” he disclosed. On sale of Expression and Nomination Forms, the communiqué stated that aspirants for the presidency would pay the sum of N40 million including N5 million for Expression of Interest Form and N35 million for nomination form. The lowest amount to be paid is by aspirants for the position of state House of Assembly, who will pay a total of N600,000, including N100,000 for Expression of Interest Form and N500,000 for Nomination Form. Others are aspirants for House of Representatives, who will pay N2.5 million; Senate, N3.5 million; and governorship, N21 million. PDP raises three member panel to resolve Edo crisis ALSO the party set up a committee to resolve the crisis in its Edo state chapter.
It constituted a panel led by Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, to immediately wade into the crisis, which has produced altercations between Governor  Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.
