Two siblings were injured in a Kerosene explosion in Obubra Local Council of Cross River State.
  
It was gathered that the sad incident happened last week in a church compound, where the boys and their father were taking refuge following a communal clash between Ochon and Alesi communities in Obubra.
 
The victims’ father, Mr. Washington Udo, who suspected that the kerosene was adulterated, said they bought the product from a boy, who was hawking it for his guardian. He said: “We have tried to locate the hawker and his guardian in vain. I was not present when the incident happened but neighbours had to rescue my children who are 11 and 13  years old on my behalf. I thought the church was safer when I escaped from the deadly communal clash.
 
“The burns were severe. They have been in the General Hospital in Obubra where they are receiving treatment.”
 
While appealing to government and good spirited individuals for financial support, he said the doctors have threatened to stop treatment, since he could not pay their treatment bill.
 
“ Government should please look into the rampant adulterated petroleum products in the state, my children are now victims to this careless and corrupt act,” he lamented.
