Analysts say earnings not reflecting on market performance Investors are set to earn over N780 billion as dividends from the 2021 financial year.

Market analysts noted that dividend-paying stocks are very important for investors for many reasons. Specifically, Managing Director/CEO APT Securities and Funds Limited, Garba Kurfi, commended listed companies for posting impressive results but expressed concerns that the declared dividends have not reflected in the performance of the stock market. According to him, these companies have declared impressive dividends to investors but “I do not know why the stock market did not respond to dividend payouts by Dangote Cement, Zenith Bank, among others. “The likes of GTCO and UBA released their audited accounts after the close of trading last week, I am yet to see stock price appreciation. Lafarge Africa, last year, was trading at N31 and declared N1 per ordinary but this year. The company declared N2 this year while trading at N24 per share. The dividend by these companies has not been reflected in our domestic market.” Meanwhile, the Development Chief Executive Officer, NGX, Temi Popoola, said the NGX has continued to leverage technology to drive activities in the market. According to him, the exchange strategy for 2022 is to keep building on the momentum on its digital journey across value chains. He added that there may be digitalised listings and digitisation of its products or offerings. “This is important because the belly of the Nigerian demography is huge and the exchange currently, represented by older people, needs the young generation. And to bridge that gap, technology is needed,” he said. While expressing confidence that few listings will take place on the platform of NGX, Popoola said the exchange is looking at diversifying listings across foods, power and agriculture to have a representation across different sectors. The NGX boss added that the exchange will be partnering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a NASDAQ-style board.
