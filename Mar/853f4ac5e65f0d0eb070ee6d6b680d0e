Following losses suffered by most blue-chip stocks, especially International Breweries and Veritas Kapital, the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) extended its bearish run to the second trading session, yesterday, as market capitalisation declined further by N27 billion. The all-share index (ASI) declined by 50.77 per cent, representing a decrease of 0.11 per cent, to close at 46,843.09 points. Similarly, the overall market capitalisation value lost N27 billion to close at N25.246 trillion. The negative performance was driven by price depreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks which are: Stanbic IBTC Holdings, International Breweries, Zenith Bank, Access Holdings and Oando. On market outlook, analysts at GTI Securities Limited said: “Bearish sentiment persists as sell-offs continue across major sectors. We expect this to continue this week with uncertainty hovering around the equity market.” Analysts from Vetiva Dealings and Brokerage said: “Baring block transactions in recent sessions, the activity level has been relatively tepid with investors’ sentiment tilting towards the bears. We are likely to see recoveries in some of the sectors tomorrow amid lower entry points.” The market breadth was negative as 18 stocks lost relative to 16 gainers.
