Management restates commitment to industrial harmony Crisis erupted at the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), yesterday, as hundreds of aggrieved workers disrupted economic activities and staged a protest over unpaid allowances. The Guardian learnt that the protesters, most of who are senior officers, barricaded the major entrance to the commission.
Efforts by some top management team to avert the demonstration proved abortive, as the agitated employees chanted various solidarity songs. The staff had expressed dismay over issues ranging from delay in the conduct of promotions to appointment of directors in the organisation. But after several consultations, the workers mandated the union’s executive members to meet with the board with a view to addressing their demands. In a swift reaction, the management assured members of staff of its resolve to restore industrial harmony. The Executive Commissioner, Corporate Services, Ibrahim Boyi, while addressing the protesters at the commission’s headquarters, promised them of management’s readiness to dialogue with them. He said: “The board of the commission is currently meeting to approve the appointment of qualified senior staff as directors, and we believe this process will be concluded very soon.” Boyi added: “We are already in discussions with the staff representatives as we speak, and we hope that at the end of today (yesterday), we will come out with agreements that would be beneficial to all, and help to ensure peace and industrial harmony in SEC.”
