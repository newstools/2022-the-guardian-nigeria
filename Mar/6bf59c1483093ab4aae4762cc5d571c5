 PHOTO: Wikipedia In many cultures, spitting is a sign of irritation, disregard or disagreement. This is the opposite among the Maasai tribe of Kenya and northern Tanzania. Although this tribe makes only about 1% of the population, they are internationally recognised and have become a tourist attraction. Their unique cultural practices and authentic way of life has been featured in many popular African series, such as The Gods Must Be Crazy.   The Maasai live a very unique way of life. They are mostly nomads, and those who arent nomads, work as tour hands and show the tourists around. Maasai people are known for their dressing; they wear numerous circular beads around their waist and neck, and wear a headpiece.. Both men and worm adorn themselves with a red sheet-like material called Shuka. Seeing as they rear cattle, this debunks the Western myth that cattle attack anything and anyone wearing bright red.
