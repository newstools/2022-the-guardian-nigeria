As the global community considers the post-2020 Biodiversity Framework through the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), key stakeholders, yesterday, raised concerns over the $967b needed yearly to reverse biodiversity loss globally.
  
The post-2020 global biodiversity framework builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity, which ended in 2020, and sets out an ambitious plan to implement broad-based action to bring about a transformation in society’s relationship with biodiversity and to ensure that by 2050, the shared vision of living in harmony with nature is realised.  “To avoid confusion, we need to be clear that while milestones focus on outcomes, all targets should focus on the transformative actions needed to achieve the 2030 mission, develop strategies aimed at implementing the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework should be integrated with efforts aimed at mitigating and adapting climate change. Thus, the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework targets should be linked to international climate goals for climate mitigation and adaptation through mechanisms such as nature-based solutions (NbS) to ensure nature-positive investment.
  
Adeleke added that there is a need to align and link strategies for implementing the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework with green strategies and net-zero emissions to create an opportunity for more biodiversity funding.
