Coach Ronke Saliu of Owena Kings has described her team’s success at the just-concluded National Division One Handball League in Benin City, Edo State, as a result of hard work rewarded by God. The Akure-based team, at the weekend, regained promotion to the top-flight league at the end of the second-tier national division one league, which they won. The team was relegated at the end of the Prudent Energy Handball League in 2019. En-route to playing in the premier league in May, Owena Kings edged out other strong contenders for the sole spot, garnering 18 points; the same points with second-placed Benue Buffaloes but finished ahead on goals difference. Edo Dynamos came third with 16 points, Corrections Boys (fourth – 13 points), Kwara United (fifth – nine points), Borno Spiders (sixth – six points), Suleja Shooters (seventh – three points) and Mindscope Academy (eighth – no point). Speaking to The Guardian, yesterday, an excited Saliu thanked God, who, crowned their effort with success. “I am very happy for the promotion… it wasn’t easy to gain promotion back to top-flight handball after being relegated in 2019. “To me, the accomplishment was God’s doing. It was not by anybody’s power because God rewards worthy effort. We really trained hard for the championship and this is the result; the secret behind our success,” she said. On the team’s preparation for the Prudent Energy National Premier League in May, she said: “Definitely, we will prepare well for the competition by also training very hard. We hope to recruit players to fortify the team for better competitiveness because, without exceptional players, one cannot deliver. “Also, we will need the support of the state government for us to remain in the top-flight league. In sports you need money for you to be able to go higher and compete well, especially when you are playing in the premier league,” she said.
