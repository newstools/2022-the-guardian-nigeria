Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited has commenced the production of tomato paste variants for the Nigerian and West African markets. The new tomato paste variant, packaged in a 65-gram sachet, is produced directly from fresh tomatoes grown in Kaduna State and other parts of the North. Unveiling the products, which are intended to circulate in the Nigerian market, the Executive Secretary of the Kaduna Investment Promotion Agency, Khalil Nur Khalil said that despite the huge security challenges, it would continue to woo foreign investors to the state. Khalil also commended the firm for believing in the state, noting that the state government would continue to support Tomato Jos Company whenever the need arises. Speaking at the event, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tomato Jos, Mira Mehta, said that the investment in the factory has attracted an initial capital outlay of $30 million and an additional N1 billion, saying that she was proud to see the dream come true. The America-born entrepreneur said, “It is a dream come true. Though entrepreneurship is full of ups and downs, I feel encouraged whenever I see my passion for this business ignite in my colleagues.” “It is the company’s first consumer product since the commencement of operations at its multi-billion-naira factory in Kaduna state last year. ” Mehta said: “I am incredibly proud of the Tomato Jos team for their hard work and belief that we could achieve something of this scale. The facility is the only one of its kind in Nigeria that can produce sachet tomato products directly from fresh tomatoes. The product is currently available throughout Kaduna State, and we intend to expand to more states by the end of 2022”. Also commenting on the development, the Managing Director of FCMB, Mrs Yemisi Edun, described the Bank’s funding of the factory as another landmark intervention to boost agribusiness, food security and food sufficiency in Nigeria.
