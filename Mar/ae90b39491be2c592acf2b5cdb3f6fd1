• ‘We’ll show them our true colours soon’ President General of Nigeria Football Supporters Club, Dr. Rafiu Ladipo, has carpeted officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), alleging that the Federation denied them opportunity to travel with the chartered flight to Ghana for today’s World Cup qualifier against the Black Stars. “This is the highest level of wickedness on the part of the NFF towards members of the various Supporters Clubs,” an angry Ladipo told The Guardian yesterday. “The NFF got a chartered flight for the trip to Kumasi, and the Federation did not deem it fit to carry any member of the Supporters Club along. No single member from the NFSC group, led by Rev. Samuel Ikpea and the Super Eagles Supporters Club (SESC), headed by Vincent Okumagba, was included on the chartered flight to Kumasi. “The few supporters club members that made the trip to Ghana paid their way either by road or by air. Whereas some people, who can’t even sing to motivate the Super Eagles on the field of play, were on the chartered flight to Kumasi. This is sad for our football. I pray we qualify for the World Cup. That is when we will show them our true colour. This nonsense must stop,” Ladipo stated. According to him, it cost between N450,000 and N500,000 to sponsor one supporters’ club member to cheer the Eagles in Kumasi. “The flight ticket is about 250,000 and one has to pay for COVID-19 test in Lagos before flying out, pay for another COVID-19 test in Ghana, pay for hotel, feeding and others. “Our singing and dancing have a way of spurring the players on the field. Despite not making it to Ghana, I have instructed members of our chapters in Ghana and Burkina Faso to join the NFSC to support the Super Eagles. I spent my money to inaugurate those chapters some years ago. I don’t see any reason why Amaju Pinnick will treat the supporters club members like dogs. It will soon stop.”
