Download logo Morocco, under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, is among the first countries to have adopted practical measures for the benefit of its citizens in Ukraine, said the Minister of Foreign Affairs, African Cooperation and Moroccan Expatriates, Mr. Nasser Bourita, on Thursday, March 03, 2022.  Speaking at the Government Council, chaired by Mr. Aziz Akhannouch, MFA Bourita stressed that the Kingdom is among the few countries to have established field teams at the borders with countries bordering the area of tension, and these teams have ensured that the transit operation of Moroccan citizens was facilitated and that special flights were scheduled in record time. In a presentation on the efforts made to support Moroccans living in Ukraine in the context of what the region is experiencing, MFA Bourita highlighted that Morocco is among the countries with a large community of students in Ukraine, with nearly 8,000 students, adding that this is why the Ministry has taken a series of proactive support measures. He recalled that the Embassy of the Kingdom in Kiev recommended in its first statement, issued on February 12, 2022, to Moroccan citizens established in Ukraine to leave this country for their safety, in addition to the organization of five flights that have allowed the repatriation of 3,000 students, in addition to the establishment of a call center that has received more than 6,000 phone calls, ensuring that these measures continued after the outbreak of events, with the guarantee of land passages for the transfer of 5,000 Moroccan citizens. “To accompany citizens on the ground and provide them with help and assistance, the Ministry has made a general mobilization both at the central level and at the level of the Moroccan embassy in Kiev and embassies of the Kingdom in countries bordering Ukraine,” noted the Minister. He also mentioned the personal presence on the ground of the ambassadors of His Majesty the King and all the diplomatic and consular staff at the border access points, the deployment of fixed consular missions along the borders of the four countries bordering Ukraine, and the easing of consular procedures for obtaining urgent travel documents for the benefit of Moroccan citizens who do not have passports.
