The Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria has reiterated its resolve to strengthen banking and finance education in the country through the injection of professionalism into the teaching and learning of the course. As part of the moves towards achieving this, the CIBN has begun the construction of a fully-equipped 160-seater lecture theatere to be called ‘The CIBN Bankers Hall,’ which would come with ultra-modern gadgets, at the Rivers State University, Port Harcourt. Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony on Monday, Dr. Bayo Olugbemi, said the project would be ready for commission before the end of his tenure as the President/Chairman of the Council of the Institute in May 2022. To bolster the performances of the Banking and Finance graduates in the country, the Institute embarked on a linkage programme, which commenced at the Rivers State University on May 23, 2017. Seventy-five tertiary institutions have been drafted into the scheme. The CIBN President said the Governing Council of the Institute resolved to institute legacy projects in six institutions across the six geo-political zones in Nigeria to deepen the collaboration with universities. “It might interest you to know that the selection of Rivers State University as one of the beneficiaries of the legacy projects was chosen purely on merit. The university emerged as the best linkage school in the South-South region after a rigorous and painstaking evidence-based appraisal exercise. “The legacy project, which CIBN is bequeathing to Rivers State University, is a 160-seater lecture theatre that will be fully furnished and equipped with ultra-modern gadgets. The edifice will serve as the melting pot for the training and development of future-ready bankers.”
