The U.S. Consulate General in Lagos, in partnership with Ascend Studios Foundation and Venture Garden Foundation, has officially opened the 2022 application for the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (AWE).
  
The AWE initiative is a platform for female entrepreneurs in Nigeria to access classroom-like theoretical and practical insights, expand their networks, and build sustainable businesses.
  
The U.S. government initiative set up to empower female entrepreneurs all over the world will select 200 participants from the 17 states of southern Nigeria for the 2022 cohort. The deadline for applications is April 7, 2022. To support comprehensive rehabilitation and reintegration of returned migrants, 50 female returnees will also take part in the programme.  She said: “This is another great opportunity for women to participate in the economic and leadership space and we encourage many female entrepreneurs to apply for the programme. This programme is a game-changer for business owners. We have seen exponential growth in the businesses of our alumni, and we look forward to welcoming successful applicants this year.”
