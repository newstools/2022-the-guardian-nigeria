Following gains recorded by MTN Nigeria and 15 other stocks, yesterday, the capital market rebounded after two days of bearish trading, as market capitalisation increased by N33 billion. The all-share index (ASI) inched higher by 61.39 absolute points, representing an increase of 0.13 per cent to close at 46,904.48 points, while the overall market capitalisation value gained to close at N25.279 trillion. The market gain was driven by price appreciation in large and medium capitalised stocks amongst which are; MTNN, Eterna, Ardova, Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI) and Ikeja Hotel. GTI Securities Limited said: “The market recovered slightly yesterday after two days of losses. As Inflationary pressures persist, investors appear indecisive in their trading activities and might tend to tilt towards the fixed income market as yields rise. We expect to witness mixed sentiment in the coming trading days.” Vetiva Dealing and Brokerage said; “Despite the slight recoveries seen in some of the sectors today, the market continues to trade bearish as sell-off activities outweigh demand, especially in the banking sector (NGXBNK down 593bps WTD). In tomorrow’s session, we expect the market to trade mixed with a chance of recovery in the banking sector given this week’s negative activity.” As measured by market breadth, market sentiment was positive as 16 stocks gained, while 15 others constituted the losers’ chart.
