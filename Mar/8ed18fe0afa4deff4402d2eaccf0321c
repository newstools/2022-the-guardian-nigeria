White people! Can they ever prosper? I doubt it. A few moons ago, the British government under its Chevening programme gave me an undeserved scholarship for a Master’s degree. It is undeserving because, usually Cheveners work hard to get the award – most of them have their First Class or Second Class Upper. I don’t have one. But some chaps sitting both in Abuja and London thought that I was some professional journalist who has discharged his duty diligently and so, they gave me the scholarship – another confession.
 
Like a good boy, I packed my Ghana-Must-Go bag and showed up in London. Before I knew what was happening, I had registered at City University. By the second week or so, my class of incredibly talented and highly accomplished journalists from across the globe met and elected me one of a three-person class representative. Sorry guys, I did not campaign and had no liver to refuse.
 
Before I knew what was happening, class began. I will call my teachers ‘sir’ and they would stare at me as if I just insulted them.    My head of department, the incredible Heather, wanted to be called Heather. Mike Gandon would follow us to the pub adjacent to the university for a pint or two. Me that I struggled to go to Unilorin and was well raised by Pa and Mama Asaju was very careful how I related with these ‘professors’ who didn’t want to be called by their titles. I told myself that I should not behave like the muzungu, because you never know – my enemies might follow me to London and get me expelled.
