Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, yesterday, inaugurated seven-member Edo State Independent Electoral Commission (EDSIEC), headed by Justice James Oyomire (rtd.), to conduct elections into local government councils across the state. The governor, during the ceremony in Benin City, charged the commission to be neutral in the conduct of the council poll, ensuring that the electoral process was free, fair and transparent. Members of the committee include: Mrs. Gladys Idahor, Mr. Uduafi Gabriel, Mr. Felix Ebhota, Mr. Okekuoyen Ehiedu, Mr. Michael Emmanuel and Mr. Vincent Aimienota. Obaseki said: “This newly constituted commission has the task of midwifing a new democratic dispensation at the local councils so that we can deepen the dividends of democracy and bring government closer to our people. “We, as government, are very sensitive to the role of the electoral empire because we are beneficiaries of a free and fair process and having benefited from a free process, are fully committed to ensuring that others have the same privilege and benefits that we enjoyed, which brought us into power.” In his remarks, Justice Oyomire thanked the governor for finding them worthy for the appointment, pledging that the committee would carry out its duty diligently in the interest of the people of Edo State.
