With effect from April 1, Nigerians who are customers to MultiChoice, owners of DSTV and GOTV would pay more for the different packages. MultiChoice announced the price changes yesterday, in a holding statement, but claimed that there would be concessions to cushion the price adjustments. The South African owned company, which had the last price hike in Nigeria in June 2020, put the new prices for DStv as follows; Premium, N21,000, Compact + N14,250, Compact, N9,000, Confam, N5,300, Yanga N2,950 Padi N2,150 Business N2,669, Xtraview + PVR access fee N2,900. The new prices moved from Premium N18, 400; Compact+ N12,400; Compact N7,900, Confam N4,615, Yanga N2,565 and Padi N1,850. GOtv subscribers will have their new price package as follows; GOtv Max, N4,150, GOtv Jolli N2,800, GOtv Jinja, N1,900. GOtv Lite N900. Subscribers have however, expressed shock over what they described as insensitivity on the part of MultiChoice. Expressing his displeasure on Twitter yesterday, a user, Chris Excel @ChrisExcel102, said “if we can have an alternative where we can watch sport without having a DSTV, DSTV can be bankrupt and close down within two weeks. Supersport is the only thing keeping DSTV alive at the moment.” Another user, Onowvo Omasoro ᴀli Ovie  @OvieNews, said this is the best time to get Nigerian-owned TSTV decoders and pay as low as N2 per station. He said a subscription of N1000 can last you four months with multiple channels, adding, “I watched the Real Madrid vs Barcelona Elclasico there.” To Akin’ Odunsi-Eshilokun, MO@gr8akin, DSTV thinks they can be increasing money every three months “like we even enjoy your shows! I only watch football there, that, I can stream! Any other thing, i don’t watch! Coman take your dish abi its plate, whatever! Nonsense!” Another user, the Humanist@The_humanist11, “How can Nigeria, a nation of 200 million, depend on the rubbish called DSTV? There is nothing exciting to watch for a long time. Repetition apart from the news channels.” Explaining the concession plans, the firm said, “At MultiChoice Nigeria, our mission is to deliver value to our customers by making great entertainment more accessible. In light of the rising costs of inflation and business operations, we have had to review the price of our packages to keep delighting our customers with great entertainment, anytime and anywhere. “Therefore, from April 1, 2022, a new pricing regime for both our DStv and GOtv packages will be in effect, “ However, to cushion the price adjustments, MultiChoice Nigeria made these concessions: “Customers who pay on or before their due date (before April 1, 2022) will be eligible to pay the old price; If they pay consistently on time (before their due dates) for a period of 12 months (1 year), they pay the old price; customers who pay for 10 months upfront on the new price will get the 11th and 12th months free.” According to MultiChoice Nigeria, the new prices will enable more quality content to be delivered to Nigerians across the country. “The price adjustments will enable us to serve our customers better, offering them more choice and great value all the time. “We remain committed to making the best content from around the world accessible at varying price points to cater to the needs of individuals and families across the country,” the firm stated.
