The lawsuit alleges a ‘false’ account Meghan shared of a “rags to riches” story amid her interview with Oprah Winfrey.   In the case archive, Samantha claims the Duchess of Sussex propelled a “premeditated campaign to destroy” her and her father’s image. She claims her sister attempted to destroy their existence so “they could not interfere with or contradict the false narrative and fairy tale life story concocted by the defendant”. She further affirmed that Meghan lied when she claimed she ‘essentially raised herself from virtual poverty’ and from 13 had to take on low-paying jobs to ‘make ends meet’. Meghan’s attorney hit back at the claim, alleging it was “baseless” and that they would provide it with limited deliberation.
