The month of March is making a statement that it belongs to women of the world. This day is important globally because it focuses on the way women have contributed to society and culture. The event additionally draws global awareness to the plight of women around the world juxtaposed with the other. Although women represent 49.58% of the world’s population, only 8.2% of this number are Fortune 500 CEOs. Women’s History Month, is, therefore, a time of reflection and knowing that women matter and should be given fair play.   As with most movements, the colour purple is used to commemorate this event showing solidarity by all who wear the colour. Besides the colour representing contemporary feminism, the IWD organisation also adds that the colour “Purple is historically associated with efforts to achieve gender equality,” as well as “achievements gained and achievements yet to come.” Based on history, the month of March had defining events concerning women’s welfare and security that took place in the month of March, therefore gaining its right to be chosen as the time to celebrate this gender. Since then, March has been a catalyst, sparking up reactions that women from around the globe have keyed into finding a place in society. Such events are traced to 1908 when women marched out in number against the subjugation they faced in a society with no equality to its fibre. Furthermore, the month has had a series of endorsements from organisations and presidents, like in February of 1980 when President Jimmy Carter declared March 8th as the women’s history week. Following that, in 1911, the first International Women’s Day Celebration was observed by Switzerland, Denmark, Austria and Germany on the 19th of March. Again in 1975, the UN started underwriting International Women’s Day on 8th March which spiked the awareness gaining global recognition. The celebration was originally to have a historical focus on women for a week beginning from the 8th of March. Starting as a week’s celebration, women now rule the whole of March following the ever-changing events and situations that shape the celebration as it is in the 21st century. Since the defining march by women in 1908, women have not backed down from being heard and making a mark in the world at large. As a result, significant contributions made by women go on to shape society. This year’s celebration sheds light on #BreakingTheBias which simply calls for a bias and stereotype-free environment. Hence, creating an all-inclusive society that is rich in diversity and as well as being equitable, all of which ultimately leads to a gender-equal society. As we celebrate women around the world, we do not fail to recognise the contributions of Queen Amina, Nwakaibeya and Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti whose impact redefined the way women are seen in Nigeria. Together, they showed that leadership, courage, and strength are not limited to any gender. In recent times, other women have taken up the challenge and become torchbearers. But for women like Ms, Amina Mohammed, Dr Dora Akunyili, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Funke Opeke, Opal Tometi, who have consistently proven that #breakingthebias is possible, girls who have been limited by society can not only dream but live it out.
