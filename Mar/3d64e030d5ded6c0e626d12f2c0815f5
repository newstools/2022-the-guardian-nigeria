It was Nigerian, Chinua Achebe, that exquisite of writers that sounded a note of caution on the proclivities of the human person for uncommon and misplaced displays of courage. He was never bereft in the use of the words of the ancients to powerfully convey messages for the wise.
 
Despite the chaos and anarchy going on in Ukraine today, perhaps the living might yet learn a lesson from Achebe: “It is sometimes good to be brave and courageous, but sometimes it is better to be a coward. We often stand in the compound of the fool and point at the ruins where a brave man used to live”. While the pogrom in Ukraine rages on and combatants and non-combatants die in a needless war, one of the recurring themes or fallouts of the conflict is the bravery and heroism of the Ukrainian people.
