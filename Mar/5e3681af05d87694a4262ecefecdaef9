Speaking at Monday night’s premiere for the new NBC talent show American Song Contest, which she co-hosts with Snoop Dogg, the music star clarified how she wants to be identified going forward. “I just got divorced, so I had to drop my married last name,” Clarkson told People Magazine. “I just kept my middle name for my personal life. I’m still Kelly Clarkson.” The Kelly Clarkson Show host then joked, “I don’t think I can change Clarkson at this point. I’m 20 years in!” Clarkson’s comments follow her filing for a legal name change back in February. The Grammy-award singer reportedly petitioned to be known by only her first and middle names — Kelly Brianne — going forward. US Weekly reporting this said Clarkson wrote that she had a “desire” to adjust her moniker because “my new name more fully reflects who I am.” Kelly Clarkson and Brandon Blackstock were married for seven years. The couple’s divorce was finalized earlier this month, with Clarkson set to give her ex a one-time payment of just over $1.3 million. Clarkson will also pay Blackstock $45,601 in monthly child support for their two children.
