The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has called on Nigerians to patronise locally-made products and services to grow the economy. The Director-General of NOA, Dr. Garba Abari, stated this  at the agency’s two-day exhibition for Nigerian products with the theme ‘Promoting Local Production and Services to boost National Economic Development.’ Abari explained that the exhibition is part of its efforts to sensitise and mobilise Nigerians to consume local products to support national economic growth. Abari said: “For us as NOA, like many other concerned Nigerians, we believe that our economy has relied too much on oil revenue and it is long overdue to diversify and prioritise local industries to generate more jobs, increase revenue and transform the economy. “This is pursuant to our key functions, which is to propagate and promote the spirit of dignity of labour, honesty and commitment to qualitative production, promotion and consumption of home-produced commodities and services. “The various strategies and approaches we deploy to sensitise and mobilise the citizens to act in ways that encourage, promote and support local production and services include advocacy, stakeholders’ forum and exhibition, media engagement, video documentary, town hall meeting and community engagements.” Also, the Director of Public Enlightenment and Mass Mobilisation, Ruth Ogun said supporting made- in -Nigeria goods is a sure way to turn around a dwindling economy. She called on states and local governments as well as ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), including the organised private sector to comply with the government’s procurement rule, which gives priority to Nigerian products.
