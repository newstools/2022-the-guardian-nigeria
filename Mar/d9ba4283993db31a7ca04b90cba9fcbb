The Benin Republic has granted the embattled Yoruba nation agitator, Sunday Adeyemo (a.k.a. Sunday Igboho), a conditional release. According to a statement yesterday, signed by the Communication Secretary to the umbrella body of Yoruba self-determination groups, Ilana Omo Oodua, Maxwell Adeleye, Igboho was released by the Benin Republic government to the leader of the group, Prof. Banji Akintoye; a French language expert and Deputy Alana of Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide, Prof. Wale Adeniran and Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka. They described Igboho’s release as a triumph of truth over darkness in Yorubaland. Igboho’s lead counsel, Yomi Alliyu (SAN), who confirmed Igboho’s release, commended Akintoye and Soyinka for their relentless efforts in ensuring the discharge of his client. He also hinted that Igboho was released from prison to his medical practitioners under the agreement that he should not leave the medical centre or Cotonou for any reason. Meanwhile, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has described Sunday Igboho’s release as a victory for self-determination. National Publicity Secretary of the organisation, Mr. Jare Ajayi, who spoke with The Guardian, said Afenifere and indeed Yoruba people as a whole were very happy that the Yoruba nation agitator had been released. He said: “Sunday Adeyemo Igboho’s release is not just for him and the Yoruba people, it is a victory for all those who believe in personal liberty and the right to self-determination.” Ajayi commended Akintoye, Prof. Tunde Adeniran, Ilana Omo Oodua, Yoruba monarchs in Nigeria and Benin Republic for their efforts in seeing that Igboho is set free. He also commended the team of lawyers handling the case in Nigeria and Benin Republic.
