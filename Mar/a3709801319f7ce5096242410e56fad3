SIR: Living in the 21st Century has many perks and privileges but with it comes some very daunting challenges, especially for women. Don’t get me wrong, men have their fair share of challenges but women across all walks of life have borne heavy burdens in silence.
 
There are many societal expectations from women, irrespective of race and strata.  Is it the obvious disparity in the way the boy child is esteemed higher and raised differently from the girl?  Or the intense pressure the young lady is under to settle down quickly because of her biological clock regardless of everything else she may have achieved in her life? Can I even dare write about how a woman’s life takes another turn once she begins to have children?
