Human rights activist, Malcolm Omirhobo (SAN), has been honoured with the Ahmadu Bello platinum award, titled ‘Icon of hope/humanitarian services’ from the National Association of Northern Nigerian Students (NANNS). In his speech, he advised African youths to seek knowledge, as, without knowledge, one cannot recognise his true self or project into the future He added that the lack of knowledge makes them ignorantly castigate their race and see Africa as primitive, backward, unprogressive and evil, demolishing our ancestors, food, colour, culture religion and everything in Africa. Recommending meticulous research at a wise and acceptable position on every issue, he established that in this Internet age, knowledge is free and simple.
   
“Never be afraid to make mistakes. Practice makes perfect and experience is the best teacher, keep striving, keep moving, keep improving and upgrade yourselves for the task you have at hand,” he said  “Never look down on someone because he comes from a particular ethnic group or sees your religion as superior to that of others. Cooperate with others, build bridges, organise and coordinate yourselves. Trust yourselves, have leaders, support yourselves, be responsible and proactive, understanding your actions affect others,” he said. Armed with knowledge, he advised Nigerian youths to be emancipated, never to see those who have looted and are still looting our commonwealth as relevant, mentors, leaders and as role models and to stop being their willing tools.
