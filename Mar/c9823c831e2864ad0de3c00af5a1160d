Liverpool have become only the second club after Manchester United to score 2,000 goals in the Premier League. The Reds hit the landmark figure in yesterday’s meeting with Brighton and Hove Albion thanks to Mohamed Salah’s 61st-minute penalty to put his side 2-0 ahead. Jurgen Klopp’s team are still some way off United in terms of all-time goals in the competition, however, with their fierce rivals boasting 2,173. Arsenal are next on the list behind United and Liverpool with 1,997 goals, followed by Chelsea (1,953) and Tottenham (1,716). Liverpool’s highest scoring Premier League season came in 2013-14 when netting 101 times, making them one of only three teams to reach the century mark in a single campaign. Well over half of Liverpool’s 2,000 goals have come at Anfield, while Newcastle United’s St James’ Park is the opposition ground they have scored their most goals at (43). Somewhat unsurprisingly, then, Newcastle are the side against whom Liverpool have scored their most goals against, finding the net 108 times against the Magpies in total. Salah’s 32-goal season in 2017-18 stands as the most prolific by a Liverpool player in the competition, with Luis Suarez (31 in 2013-14) the only other to breach the 30-goal mark. Robbie Fowler remains Liverpool’s top scorer in Premier League history with 128, and is one of four players to reach the century mark for the club – alongside Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen and Salah.
