University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN Lions), at the weekend, were empathic in their demolition of University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT), beating the Rivers State-based team 4-2 in one of the games of the qualifying phase of the 2022 Higher Institutions Football League (HIFL). Playing at home at the UNN Sports Complex, the Nsukka Lions scored the first three goals within 30 minutes through Onyedika Nwafor, Ikprama Somtochukwu and Odo Nonso in the sixth, 12th and 28th minutes respectively. The Sharks managed to score a goal in the 33rd minute to reduce the deficit before the break. In the 64th minute of the second half, Joshua Okai scored the second goal for the Sharks to raise the hope of securing a possible draw. But the Lions had other ideas. Ezea Luke of the Lions drew the dagger into the hearts of the fans of Sharks when he scored on the dot of the 90th minute to ensure the first leg victory for UNN. “Leading by three goals in the first half, my boys thought they could relax, but they found that football is not so, as our opponents tried to come back. “However, realising the need to be consistent, my team scored the fourth goal to ensure that we won. We will prepare better for the second leg so we can win in Port Harcourt, the same way we did against UNIBEN Royals last year,” Coach Ike said. In other games, LASU Blazers proved pundits wrong by winning their away game with the AAUA Luminaries by 2-0. Yahaya Subair scored the first goal for the Blazers in the 44th minute, while Toyin Odufejo put a stop to the Luminaries quest for an equaliser in the 89th with a sublime finish. HiFL reigning champion, UNIMAID Desert Warriors, were held to a 1-1 draw by BUK Stallions from Bayero University, Kano, while 2021 fourth place team, FUTMINNA Transformers, were held 2-2 at home by KSU Steelers from Kogi State University.
