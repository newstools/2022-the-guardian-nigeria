The United States announced Monday a new tranche of weapons for Ukraine’s forces fighting Russia, including ammunition for the increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns. The new $550 million package will “include more ammunition for the high mobility advanced rocket systems otherwise known as HIMARS, as well as ammunition” for artillery, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. This brings the total of military assistance committed to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office to more than $8 billion, he said.
