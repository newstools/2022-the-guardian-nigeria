In a recent interview, the “Toyin Tomato” star revealed the sacrifices she had to make for her children, which included leaving Nigeria and her career to go monitor her children’s education in London. Sobowale said, “I left the shores of Nigeria for a purpose. Children are not asked to be born. The moment you decide that you want to have children, then you must be ready to take full responsibility for those children. They’re beautiful creatures. You don’t bring them to this world to suffer; you don’t.” She continued, “You don’t bring them to this world for anybody to take care of them. You brought them, then stay with them and do the work. My father was a retired principal, my mother, a retired headmistress. May their souls rest In peace. I know what they did for me and for my siblings and I know what is called education, that is the only legacy you can give your children.” “I know the university. I know how they select people from abroad in premier universities, up to state before going to private universities. And I looked and said my children they either go to University of Ibadan, Ife, or UNILAG. But unfortunately, today strike, Tomorrow strike. A course of three years, they will end up doing six years and I said no.” “If I can be paying this much for primary and secondary, I’m not going to throw that away at a university, so let my children leave Nigeria. That was why I moved my children out of Nigeria to London.” She observed that her children changed after spending a month in England since they had lost contact with her. According to her, she then made the decision to travel to the country and monitor her children’s education.
