The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has suspended the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise. This is despite pleas from Nigerians and relevant stakeholders urging the commission to extend the deadline. The Guardian observed on Monday that INEC’s registration portal – https://cvr.inecnigeria.org/home/index is no longer for active for new applicants. A notice on the website reads: “The CVR Exercise has been suspended. Access to log-in to check the status of your completed applications will soon be restored.” The commission had declared that the exercises would officially end on July 31, 2022. Prior to this notice, INEC extended the June 30 deadline but did not stipulate when the exercise would officially end. As at last week Monday July 25, about 11 million Nigerians have been added to the new voter register since the exercise began in June last year.
