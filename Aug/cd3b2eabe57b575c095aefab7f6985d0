The report notes that the Santa Fe-style home was bought by an unnamed trust that somehow had connections to Amber Heard back in 2019 for just over $570,000, and the house recently sold for almost double the original price. According to reports, Amber’s family members paid $570k for the Yucca Valley property, sold it for $1,050,000, and made a profit of roughly $480k. The new owner acknowledged to media sources that he has been working with Amber Heard’s representatives even though he hasn’t personally spoken to her. The actress is in debt for around 8.3 million, according to information from the courthouse; she plans to challenge this move.
