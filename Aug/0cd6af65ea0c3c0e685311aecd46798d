Travel between Nigerian states has a reputation of disregarding the time of travellers and being generally tardy and uncomfortable. TAPIS is changing the narrative by being right on time and providing the travellers with the most comfortable trip ever with various comforting features. Lagos, August, 1st, 2022 —Touch and Pay Technologies, the number one NFC & transport payments processor in Nigeria is officially announcing the launch of TAP Interstate (TAPIS). This service allows commuters to board interstate buses at any of the designated BRT terminals at Yaba, Ojota & Ewu. TAPIS is a timely alternative for travelling interstate between Lagos – Abeokuta – Ibadan. They say time is money and no one appreciates waiting for so long at the park for a full bus before leaving for their destination. With TAPIS, the time of travellers is highly valued and they will no longer waste a minute waiting for a bus to get filled with passengers before embarking on the journey. The TAPIS team has strategically picked time schedules for the trips so everyone is included and catered for. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1819959 lazyload" src="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule.png" alt="" width="900" height="900" srcset="https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule.png 900w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-598x598.jpg 598w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-58x58.jpg 58w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-116x116.jpg 116w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-100x100.jpg 100w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-200x200.jpg 200w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-240x240.jpg 240w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-480x480.jpg 480w,https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Routes-and-Schedule-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /> For a better experience and sweet deals, TAPIS has partnered with the Cowry transport app to enable travellers to prebook interstate trips and make payments right from the app. Free Wi-Fi, charging ports on the bus, AC, life and luggage in transit insurance, and timeliness are some of the amazing features TAPIS has to offer travellers that chose its services.
