A Nigerian Alika Ogorchukwu has been confirmed dead after being assaulted in Civitanova Marche city in the Province of Macerata, Marche region of Italy. The Nigerian Embassy in Rome said it is collaborating with relevant Italian authorities to ensure justice and provide succor to Ogorchukwu’s family. Ogorchukwu’s death was followed by a wave of protests across Italy. Al Jazeera reported that Ogorchukwu, a 39-year-old physically challenged vendor, was attacked at his stall by a “32-year-old from Salerno” on Friday. The assailant grabbed the vendor’s crutch and struck him down. He wrestled the supine victim in broad daylight with several surveillance cameras recording. The police have arrested a man identified as Filippo Claudio Giuseppe Ferlazzo, based on the camera footage. He was apprehended on suspicion of murder and theft of the victim’s phone. Police investigator Matteo Luconi said the attacker repeatedly struck the Nigerian with his bare hands, causing his death. The aggressor went after the victim, first hitting him with a crutch. He made him fall to the ground, then he finished, causing the death, striking repeatedly with his bare hands,” he said. Daniel Amanza, head of the association for immigrants in the Marche region’s Macerata province (ACSIM) disclosed that Ogorchukwu was married with two children. Amanza said Ogorchukwu resorted to selling goods on the street after he was struck by a car and lost his job as a labourer due to his injuries.
